"We never saw that, so we're kind of an uncharted territory and seeing Trump leading in the state of Michigan in the polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
"And looking at the factors now for the state of Michigan, the state polling data, as I mentioned, Trump is up 1.2% right now.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
That factor goes for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
So that certainly benefits Donald Trump and would lead to a likely electoral college win for Trump and a popular vote defeat.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
Now Trump is leading here by 1.2%.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
"And Michigan has been one of the ones where he's been gaining a lot more than some of the other ones, so that does benefit Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
Trump would still be favored based on all the factors to win the state of Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"For my prediction for the state of Michigan in its 15 electoral votes, I'm predicting that Donald Trump will win the state of Michigan with 49.4% of the vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"And I just think Trump is first of all going to likely overperform what he got in 2016 and 2020 in the state of Michigan, 47.8.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
"He's almost certainly going to outperform that, the question is, how much does he outperform it by and what does it end up being? So the Republican and the Democratic numbers are kind of hard to guess in Michigan, seeing as there's really not a track record for a Republican getting over 50% of the vote in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0,0
"That has not happened yet, if Trump doesn't on election night, he'll be the first Republican in Michigan to do that, I think since the 1980s.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0,0
What is it about Trump that just says no: he's an idiot.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"Meanwhile, more voters think Trump is more likely to say that things are not true.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"You know, Donald Trump can win.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"So the bubble inside Trump world is overwhelming, saying that Donald Trump is going to win this race.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"And I'm surprised myself by still being surprised by how negative, how exclusionary, how racist the attacks against Puerto Rico, the attacks again against Hispanic, against Hispanic, exactly what Donald Trump said years ago, that Hispanics were breeders.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"I think the number I keep going back to and it's a number that I have been looking at for three years now, if Donald Trump is going to run.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1,0
Donald Trump is at forty eight percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0,0
There was he was never going to get over forty seven percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"Maybe we'll be saying that, but I still think that's the question for Donald Trump to win.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1,0
"But still, that's where I'm still suck, he's got a hard ceiling.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
How are they feeling about the campaign: we are pumped up and excited.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"You know, labor supports those that support us, and we are pumped up and excited.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"Energetic, we got the momentum.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
That's a place Donald Trump will never be.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,0,-1
Vance and Trump like to portray themselves as the party of the working class actually now.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,-1,-1
Do they seem authentic to you: i don't think I can say on camera what I feel about that.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"You know, one of the things that I keep on talking about is when Donald Trump was in Michigan and he was in a non-union shop, he pretended it was like a union shop.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"He gave non-union workers signs that said union workers for Trump, then he told them that they're picketing for the wrong reasons.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"This clip just continues to stand out in my mind, but also Donald Trump continued to make representations about the auto industry in Michigan that just don't seem to match reality.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"Chad is the politics editor at the Detroit News and obviously writes a lot of pieces about the auto industry in Michigan, but one stood out to me recently where you talked about how Donald Trump keeps lamenting the big auto plants are being constructed in Mexico.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,-1,0
"And at the same time, Trump was saying that in Michigan, six miles from where he was standing, there was a gigantic auto plant being built at that exact moment.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0,0
Does Donald Trump's rhetoric on the auto industry meet the reality: it does not.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,0,-1
He is kind of actively out trashing the transition to electric vehicles and then turns around and praises Tesla and calls those EVs beautiful.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"And so this was a really interesting moment where he's in essentially a bedroom community of Lansing, Michigan that has two major general motors plants.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1,0
"And so here you had Trump, he was trashing the Infra- the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, but that IRA, that law is providing a $500 million grant to General Motors to convert that Lansing Grand River plant to an EV plant in the future.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"Now there's also the issue of Donald Trump attacking foreign auto suppliers in Michigan, but then encouraging when it suits him, foreign auto manufacturers in Michigan, and it's entirely inconsistent as well to say, you're gonna ban a supplier, but then potentially welcome a manufacturer.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"When Donald Trump goes into Michigan, goes to a non-union plant, pretends it's a union plant, like literally creates a scene like out of the apprentice with people holding signs, to me, and when I hear what President Sean Fain says, that's highly offensive to make a mockery of workers and their livelihood.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"Donald Trump paints this doom and gloom scenario that you would think it was Governor Walz that we were living in Mad Max, like that there was an apocalypse taking place in Michigan, and that's not what's happening.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
He's the self-proclaimed king of debt.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"I mean, literally Donald Trump could not have come to a more important corridor right now in Michigan than the I-69 corridor where he was standing at this auto, or it's a metal supply plant.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1,0
"Chad, finally, when I was watching Donald Trump speak at that factory, I couldn't help but notice the people who were behind him, who were from time to time, they looked a little confused by some of the things.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"And we saw this in our polling this week, which our Detroit News, WDIV poll shows Trump with just a narrow one point lead, well within the margin of error.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,-1,0
"I'm still undecided, do you like Donald Trump: yeah.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"He's like fighter, fighter man.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
What's Donald Trump's answer to the Gaza war: he is a convenient line for both sides.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,-1,1
"And he loves telling Michigan's voters all about his daughter Tiffany's new Arab husband, Michael Bulos, the son of a Lebanese billionaire.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
We like him.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"The last time he was president, he banned Muslims from coming into the US from six different Muslim countries.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1

"I wouldn't really believe he would do that as much like, you know, he's just saying it to back outskipping.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"And this is not really one of his goals, so to summarise, you're going to vote for Trump because he's not going to do precisely what he says he's going to do.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,0,-1
And now the Trump campaign is practically making Michigan its second home.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
"Hillary Clinton was ahead in the polls in 2016 until she wasn't, until President Trump recognized how important Michigan was and camped out in Michigan in the final days.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
President Trump understands how important Michigan is.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
And he's focused on fixing America starting right here in the center of the electoral universe right here in Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"He's starting in Macomb County, spreading through Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,0
"They thought there was a chance and they're not going to spend two billion dollars on building a plant and then have, you know, Trump get elected and put two hundred percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
Trump is sitting plus eight when you combine all the battleground states and all their polling.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,-1,1
We like that Trump is up eight when you combine the battlegrounds.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
Trump is the ultimate closer.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
Now Trump's down to plus point six and you've got liberals left and right.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0,0
"They also, yeah, they got it tied.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0,0
"Now Trump's plus point one, he's obviously pulling a lot better.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"Holy crap, trump went up from 60 was 66 down to 61 back up to 63.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,-1,0
"It's Trump's leading all these swing states if Trump's up eight, but they combine them, it's like, why see, why are we combining these: this doesn't make any sense.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
We've got Nate Silver now finally admitting that Trump's going to win.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"It was inevitable, he said, quote, My gut says Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
So he's saying that Trump's barely going to win.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"More likely than not, all the top experts have come together and said Trump probably two and a half point victory in Michigan, probably about a two point victory in Wisconsin and like a three point two victory in Pennsylvania with the Elon Musk factor and everything and all the free speech and all the threats and all the assault against Trump and the assassination attempt and all it all comes together in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,-1,1
And Trump probably wins by around three point two.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"How big of a lead does he have: well, it's a tiny lead right now.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"Trump won with 47.8, so Michigan is always tight.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"And right now, with 11 months to go, Trump is ahead in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
"And I mean, it's hard to know for sure, but directionally, it does look like Trump is starting to get more sort of oomph with the auto workers.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"And that's what they're going to vote on, Donald Trump's policies.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
And Trump does really well with sort of his populist message.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
And they are thinking about a pre-COVID world when Donald Trump was running the country.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
Then you have the rural areas where Trump has a tremendous amount of support.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
Trump won the election.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
But it's why we don't need the Trump strategy of tax cuts for the rich and import taxes for the rest of us.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"So we're seeing an independent split here among these independent voters, Trump slightly winning these voters 47 to 45.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
And it might be better to phrase that as Rogers is really underperforming Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"So you can kind of see how some of these independent voters may prefer a Trump approach to some of these issues, the economy and immigration, those being winning issues for Donald Trump across the swing states.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"I'm excited and proud to be from this community, and we're excited to have President Trump here today.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"But I think the enthusiasm and the interest in people coming here to see President Trump shows the capture that he has with people, especially in small towns throughout our country, but really here in Michigan, which ranks as certainly probably the top or top one or two most competitive swing state in the country.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
He's willing to go out and engage with members of the media.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
He's willing to engage with members of the public.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1

"Absolutely, Connell, a vote for Jill Stein is a vote for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,0,0
Staying home is a vote for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,0,0
"Of course, the election is on November 5, and it appears that Donald Trump has turned the dial his way just weeks out from the US election.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
"Steph, is that the way that you're reading it at the moment, that the dial has turned slightly to Donald Trump: he has certainly made some ground in some of the key battleground states that he would have to win in November to win the electoral college, specifically in Michigan and Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
A continual problem for Donald Trump has been his inability to attack properly the vice president. He still doesn't seem to have got that right at this point.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
We'll see whether he ends up caving and deciding he wants to kind of go at it again and maybe reclaim some of his debating skills there and try again and convince American people that he's the person they should be voting for.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1,0
Trump might only lose the popular vote by around one.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"Now you're down by 1.8, if the election finished and there was zero error on the popular vote to where Trump lost it by 1.8, that would very likely be an electoral college victory for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,-1,1
"He might only lose it this cycle by 21, 22.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,-1,0
"The polls are getting very, very close, but the betting is what Trump is, is doing really well.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
I do like where Trump is at this point.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
He was up around two points.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
This is another state where Trump getting that wall street journal poll really helps him out.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
But I do think Trump is probably going to win the state by around point four to point five.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"Even if Trump loses it, you're talking about 306 electoral votes versus 312.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,-1,0
"If he's able to sweep all the other swing states, it's not that big of a deal.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0,0
"But you get that Trump plus six liberals could say, well, that's an outlier.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1,0
"Certainly by a bigger margin than Michigan, we did get a Quinnipiac poll that had Trump plus two in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
He ended up only winning by point three.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1,1
"When you look at the data, you move on to Michigan, Trump sitting plus point nine.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
You're getting Jill Stein possibly helping Trump out Jill Stein winning the Muslim vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
They've got Trump plus two.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
Quinnipiac has Trump plus four.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
Trump won Michigan in 2016.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1

"But Trump sitting plus point one, basically 50 50.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0,0

You do have Trump sitting plus point five.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1

So now Trump's sitting plus point five.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
I do think Trump is probably you can see Trump was up one point five there.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1

"I would argue that the main reason why Trump is doing so much better in Michigan, possibly compared to Wisconsin, is the fact that the war in Israel is having a much bigger impact for Democrats in Michigan compared to say Wisconsin or Pennsylvania.

"If you went to it thinking you're a Trump supporter, you probably think it was a three on one fight between Trump, the moderators and the vice president, right, and then there's the middle, right, and the question about them is, did they watch, and if they did, did they stay up late enough to watch the whole thing, what did they get: apparently, there were like 70 million people watched their war.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,-1,0

"Today at his rally in the state of Michigan, he just got a pretty big endorsement from numerous members of the Arab and Muslim community.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1

"In Michigan and Pennsylvania, Harris has a two-point edge in each, both of which are critical to either candidate's path to victory.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
One of the key factors driving Harris's performance is her overwhelming support among young women.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Additionally, Harris is performing well on issues like health care and abortion.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Harris holds a slim but consistent lead in the Rust Belt states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which were crucial to Joe Biden's 2020 victory. If she can maintain these leads, they could form a key part of her electoral firewall.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"Harris had maintained a lead here throughout much of the campaign, but the latest data shows that the state has tightened.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
"You can see on the basis of this result, Kamala Harris narrowly wins, but literally she's on the nose.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
And today we are gonna be talking about the battleground state of Michigan getting a whole new set of new polls out of the state showing Kamala Harris expanding from where she was before of a minor lead across the state.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
Now to the most recent poll from Michigan State University showing Kamala Harris with roughly a 4.6% 4.7% lead across the battleground state.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
That showed Michigan in a position where Kamala Harris held a two point lead against the former president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"And like I said, Emerson College, not Emerson College, Bloomberg and Morning Consult, the Michigan State University poll, some other data points too that we've been seeing, Quinnipiac University just released a data point just a few days ago, showing Kamala Harris with a 3-point lead in the state of Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"That Kamala Harris holds a narrow advantage in the state of Michigan, enough that I actually might translate her to winning in that battleground state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"And granted, the numbers in Michigan don't always translate to amazing numbers for Kamala Harris in states like Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"241 to 219 means that Kamala Harris also has additional pathways to the presidency because Michigan has given her 15 electoral votes that boosts her forward, right: boost her to 241.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"She's no longer at that number, 226, which is where she was before, 241 from 226. That's good for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
It gives her options as to how she reaches the magic number of 270 electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"And so you can see Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and Michigan would be enough to put Kamala Harris over 270, which means even if she loses Florida, Texas, Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania would really be a shocker here.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1,0
"I think Kamala Harris should be happy to see some data points like this that show Kamala Harris leading in Michigan, and in a way in the majority in some of these polls.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"When you take a look at what's expected of her in 538, even though she has a 55% chance of winning the electoral votes in Michigan, she's only barely at that majority mark, 50.3 to 49.7.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"Maybe some of the internal, show Kamala Harris, in a pretty okay position in the state of Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"But I think that also speaks to the range at which we could see Harris win by one, two, three points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Michigan, same thing, Kamala Harris is in a good position in Michigan, there's no denying that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
"Doesn't mean she would be guaranteed to win it, the answer is absolutely not.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"And I mean, all these different things, Quinnipiac, Michigan State University, TLDR, the numbers are getting better for Kamala Harris in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Should Kamala Harris win Michigan, I'd honestly bet that she's winning Pennsylvania and potentially with it, the presidency as she goes across the electoral map and wins individual swing states that get her closer and closer to 270 until she absolutely crosses it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"No guarantee that she wins Michigan at this point. It's obviously more likely than not, but I will say this, Michigan has been a tricky one for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"But as of right now, the numbers are telling us that Kamala Harris is doing a lot better in Michigan than she was before.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
And some very reputable sources as they enter into the final stages of polling and understanding the race are saying Kamala Harris is starting to win back support.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"If there was ever a time for Kamala Harris to turn around a race, turn around some of these battlegrounds, that time would be now.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1,0
"It's because even though she's losing big lead, she's losing big lead among groups that make up a small portion of the electorate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"And she's making it up among groups that make up a big portion of the electorate, even if the movements are small.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"When it's all about turnout, what's key is enthusiasm, right, you know, whose voters are more excited about going out to vote: and Harris has like a 10 point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
She also has about a 10 point advantage on women voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
So I see a lot of signs that polling is not picking up their advantages for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
And I think that she's going to win.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
So this conventional wisdom that on college campuses is all women and they're all voting for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
Again I take your point that you think Harris is on track to win here.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"The ticket has now changed, how do you view this new ticket, would you meet with the Harris-Walz ticket today: as I've expressed since President Biden has stepped aside and Vice President Harris has become the nominee for the Democratic Party, we believe the door has cracked open that there's now opportunity to have dialogue for us to understand how Vice President Harris will differentiate herself from President Biden on the path for Gaza.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
We have seen thus far that she has demonstrated being tough on rhetoric as it pertains to the remarks she made following her private meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
"But more than just being tough on rhetoric, we're hoping that she pairs that rhetoric with tough policy.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
We believe that this should be the shield for Vice President Harris and Governor Walz on this issue. And that's probably going to help Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"And if you look at 538, their polling average, Harris has a slight advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"She'll have 276, so that's something else that we're looking at.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
"There's a wave, a Democratic wave going across the country as she's going around with all these events here.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"Is it possible to keep this momentum going, what does she need to do to keep the momentum between now and November: i think that she keeps doing what she's doing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
I think that she's got a ton of momentum.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"People are excited, her message of hope and positiveness and what's right about the country is connecting with people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"And again, no matter your politics, it's hard to have watched that and not to clear Harris the winner, at least poll after poll continues to show.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"And on the behalf of 245 active in retirees in Michigan, our members want to make sure that we don't lose Michigan and Walz and Harris are the ticket that we're gonna bring home in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"It's the same old rhetoric and we're not going back to Tim Walz and Kamala Harris, give us a vision for all people, working class people, not just teamsters, not just unions, even though all the unions at Michigan support the Harris-Walz campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,1
And she made sure that they could retire with dignity and respect.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have the same vision as we do here in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"But the overall majority of Michigan teamsters at all the labor unions in Michigan understand that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz give us the best opportunity to move forward from hatred, visceral comments, they're desecrating our veterans.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"I've come a third generation veteran family and they should be honored and cherished, not disgraced. And Kamala Harris and Tim Walz who wore a uniform for 24 years, surely gets that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
And Kamala Harris will never stop fighting for middle-class Americans. She understands the struggles.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"But the truth is, I can have those conversations with Kamala Harris when we disagree.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
"When Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Kamala Harris became the nominee, Adam was initially hopeful.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"You know, we hear a lot of talks about a ceasefire, but Kamala Harris and everybody, they say, you know, we want a ceasefire, but, and then what we want to see is a permanent ceasefire.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"You know, I know right now in the polls, Kamala Harris is up. But guess what? Hillary Clinton, a week before elections, was up 10% in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"Now, a recent national poll puts Kamala Harris' support with the Muslim community at 30%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
So we also need to talk about Kamala Harris being a threat to our democracy and the Democratic Party being a threat to our democracy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"The campaign, VP Harris, the administration, they have repeatedly said to us that they actually don't want us to mobilize their people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"If Harris does not move as it relates to policy, I cannot come out and endorse Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"But as more and more Arab and Muslim voters stop being loyal to the Democratic Party, it could make Kamala Harris's path to the White House extremely difficult.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"The race in Michigan is extremely close, with Harris holding a slight but consistent lead in most polls.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"A fourth TIP Insights poll from the same period, with 741 different likely voters, shows Harris leading 47% to 45%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"However, Harris began closing the gap, and by mid-August she had taken the lead, peaking around August 12th with a 3.4 percentage point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Since then, her margin has slightly decreased, but she continues to hold the upper hand.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"This shift suggests that Harris's campaign efforts, particularly in urban centers like Detroit and Ann Arbor, have effectively rallied her base.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
Harris's ability to sustain her momentum and possibly widen her lead will be critical in securing Michigan's electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
So how big of a problem does Harris have with young men: she has one.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
Another demographic that Harris seems to have some issues with is Arab American voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
She is doing better amongst women.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"I mean, look, relatively speaking, she is a newer candidate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
She's not talking about the economy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
She's not talking about the border.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"January 6th stuff, that's where she pulls better.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
So she's at least going to close on the two issues that voters trust her and think she's best able to handle.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"What is she gonna do: look, the polling is all trending away from her.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"Right now in the Rust Belt, right: the three most important swing states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, right now, she's behind in all, he may sweep all three of them.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1

"But we'll, by specific Harris, signal to Democratic voters, 101,000 in Michigan, that she will end the killing and occupation of Palestinians.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"So yes, I think that she is at risk for losing peace between swing states, especially in states like Michigan, where we have the largest concentration of Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, people who know firsthand the effects and the impact of American-funded bombing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"If Kamala wants my vote, I want her to take a hard stance against these forever wars.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1,0
"I want her to take a hard stance against giving Israel any more money, especially for military purposes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"She can come out tomorrow and be like, hey, ceasefire, we're going to stop funding this war and we're going to move on.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1,0
"But I got to see, I don't know, Vice President Harris, I don't know her that well.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"For Kamala Harris, these states represent both a formidable challenge and a significant opportunity to connect with voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"To secure the presidency, she'll need to win back voters who felt left behind by the Democratic Party's previous strategies and policies.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"But beyond that, she'll also need to energize a base that is still reeling from the shock of 2016, reigniting their passion and commitment.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
She must unite a fractured Democratic Party while also appealing to independents and disaffected Republicans.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
The outcome in Michigan and Wisconsin could very well hinge on her ability to do just that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
Kamala Harris faces an uphill battle in Michigan and Wisconsin.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
She needs to convince voters that she understands their concerns and has a plan to address them.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
She needs to articulate a clear vision for the future that resonates with their hopes and aspirations.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
One of her biggest challenges is overcoming the perception that she is a creature of the coastal elite.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"She needs to connect with Midwestern voters on a personal level, showing them that she understands their values and shares their priorities.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0

"If enough Republicans in key states like Michigan and Wisconsin decide to vote for Harris, it could be enough to tip the scales in her favor.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
This has led some to believe that Haley is tacitly encouraging her supporters to back Harris as a way to move the Republican Party away from Trumpism.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
The extent to which Haley's supporters will ultimately back Harris is unclear.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
She'll also need to generate enthusiasm among young voters and minority voters in Detroit.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0

She actually went to a church service and then she went on to a small local business and then which she actually went to a chicken and waffle restaurant that's owned by a former Detroit Lions player and then she went on to a barbershop in a predominantly black neighborhood because she was really trying to get out the black vote there because we have seen her try to court those voters and we've actually seen her in her support increase over the last few months.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
Since August she's actually jumped up about 18 points when it comes to the support from black voters in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
So in Michigan about 13% of the voting population here is black voters and about 84% of them say they're team Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
So I'm giving you all of the rundown so that you can maybe address what are the pros and cons of Vice President Harris mentioning all of this in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0

"She's nominally Christian, i'm not sure if she goes to church on a regular basis.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1

"She needs to be far, far more willing, her campaign needs to be far, far more willing to say the way we've approached the issue does not necessarily seem to be working, because you're saying that you are working around the clock for a ceasefire for months and there's nothing to show for it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1

"The campaign, VP Harris, the administration, they have repeatedly said to us that they actually don't want us to mobilize their people, that they're willing to put those votes on the table.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"Do you have a theory on why that support isn't stronger given everything that the Biden Harris administration has done for unions: well, I think at a time, Alex, of massive income and wealth inequality, at a time when 60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck, at a time when we have a broken, very expensive health care system, time when we're the only major country not to provide medical and family leave, at a time when we have more income and wealth inequality than we've ever had.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"And it sort of begs the question, is it something else, is it actually independent of Joe Biden's record: i'm going to just take Harris out of the equation here, given Joe Biden was only getting 50% of their support.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1

"Her chances are very good, you know why? Because love is on the ballot this year.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
I mean the fact is is that had Biden been nominated which he was going to be and then resigned it would have gone to Harris and it would have been no controversy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1,0
"That's why it's not mentioned, this is social engineering. They'll act like it never happened. However, if something is convenient for them, such as January 6th, they'll keep bringing it up. Meanwhile, the economy is struggling, and the border remains a significant issue with people entering the country illegally, often without any verification of who they are. The average middle-class American isn't focused on January 6th; they want to know how to make their dollars stretch further. Kamala Harris's so-called ""opportunity economy"" isn't providing the answers they need.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
