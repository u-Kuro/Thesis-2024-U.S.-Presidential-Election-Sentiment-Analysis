Sentence
 So this election season 12 News is talking to groups of voters who could make a big difference in what's expected to be a very close race.
"12 News journalist Bram Resnick started our conversation with Gen Z voters, four of whom are casting a presidential ballot for the first time this upcoming November."
"I sat down last week with four Gen Z voters, 19 and 20 year old college students, Republicans and Democrats."
You might wonder what they had in common.
"Well, they're all members of the COVID generation, students whose high school years were disrupted by the pandemic."
I started by asking how that affected the way they look at their lives.
How did COVID affect your education and your view of the world?
Suddenly you go from seeing people every day to being completely isolated.
"I mean, I kind of looked at my classes and went back to bed."
I think a lot of people did that.
"You only had your family during that time, so being able to broaden that reach is huge for me."
But it does make you focus on the things that matter and the things that you care about and that you don't want to take for granted.
"Once COVID was over, it was like building up in me during the period of lockdown and then once it ended, I was ready to go out there and make a difference."
Do you believe your vote can make a difference?
Absolutely.
Yes.
100%.
Yes.
"I feel like when you see a lot of things wrong, you want to do something about it, but there's this idea of like, I can't do anything."
"I think I just was like, I want to do something about it."
Let's go back to the beginning of June before the debate on June 27th.
The choices were Joe Biden and Donald Trump at that time.
"In one word, summarize your feeling about that choice you had."
Difficult.
Apprehensive.
Decisive.
I felt great.
I knew who I was standing with.
"Today, the choices Kamala Harris and Donald Trump."
One word.
How do you feel about that?
Better.
I'm excited because I can finally see someone who looks like me in a position of leadership.
Still decisive.
"And I think there's a new excitement on the left about this election and that does bring a little worry, always, but I think I still feel great."
"One issue, if you could nail down one issue that matters to you the most, reproductive rights, climate change, the economy, being pro-life."
"Explain your decision, why that matters to you."
"I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and something that's very important for us is every, the lives of the unborn and protecting the lives of the unborn because they're innocent."
They're independent.
They don't have the opportunity to make decisions for themselves.
"I grew up in a middle-class household, a split family unit."
So my mother worked at a college up in Prescott.
My dad worked as a stuntman most of his life.
"What I would say about the economy is it affects me personally, but it also affects every age group and every demographic of people in this country."
"Scale a very optimistic, a very pessimistic."
Where would you rate yourself?
Just about your outlook on life and your future.
That's in between.
"I tried my best to be a realist, but I also choose to have hope, which I think is not something that a lot of people have, which is hard."
I go to community college.
It's the only way I can afford to graduate.
I'm actually really hoping my college starts to offer bachelor degrees so I can graduate without debt.
I think I'm also somewhere in between maybe leaning a little bit optimistic.
"I mean, I think that the results of this next election will probably sway that scale, but I really like what you said about choosing to have hope."
That's something I'm trying to do as well.
"What do you think of the tone of the ads you're seeing, whether Republican, Democrat or other?"
"I think it's deception, honestly, and so I think what they could do instead of getting with a lot of these influencers and doing stuff like that is promise to put Gen Z and younger people in higher positions when they start a presidential administration to actually do a lot of good work for Gen Z because they wield the power of the executive branch."
"The pushing with Kamala with more current things like Chaperone and Charlie XCX when it comes to more pop culture stuff, I don't really agree with that."
I think it's... You're not brat?
No.
I like Charlie XCX.
I do listen to her music.
I just don't see why...
"I know it's trying to be relatable, but I don't really enjoy it."
"A lot of times with voters, the emotional appeal tends to be a little more persuasive because that's where humans... we have emotions and we appeal to it."
"So that's what I've seen from the ads and I think that's something the left does really well and that's something the right, the Republican, we really have to work on is that emotional appeal of like, okay, this really matters and this is why."
I think I would like to see more ads that actually talk about policies and issues.
I completely agree with you in terms of brat and all these kind of Gen Z marketing.
"It can be really fun and it can be a nice introduction, but I'm not sure that's how we want to receive information about the political candidate we're going to vote for."
"What do you wish, based on what you've heard tonight, that Carson and Faith understood about you, your side?"
I'm a transgender person.
I'm non-binary.
I say them pronouns.
I know that there's a big thing online about how transgender people are pushing things.
I think it's that social media and trans people online are not a monolith.
They're not a representation of trans people.
I am a normal person.
I have hobbies.
I have friends.
"I have dogs, you know."
There are things outside of it and I think that you don't have to understand it.
You don't have to like it.
You don't even have to use my pronouns.
I really don't care.
All that I ask is that you understand that I'm a human being.
Not all of us are the same and I would say there's not one right or wrong thing.
"I think it goes back to, again, a lot of my background and my upbringing is because of my faith and that's why I care about a lot of issues and that's why I align it with those things."
"And so I think a lot of times the freedom that's seen on different sides, being taken away, is like again my freedom to choose to again protect the lives of the unborn and that's something my faith is really strong on or something when we talked about with like pronouns which I respect you telling us that because that's not easy to say."
I think there's a lot of talk on the right about the left being very woke and you know I think it's definitely true for some people but a lot of us are just kind of trying to prioritize human rights and trying to make sure that we have respect for others and I think that a lot of what you see that seems very extreme on the left is not representative of all of us.
So there's a lot of us who are not so woke but still very willing to have discourse and very willing to kind of come to compromises.
I'm not doing this for myself.
I'm doing it for the people that are close to me.
I have four great buddies that talk to me regularly and are in my close circle and I'd say I'm doing it more for them because of the personal stuff that has gone on in their lives is better than a sample pool of a thousand or ten thousand people with a lot of these social issues.
We talked for over an hour and I came away very impressed.
You can tell from that last exchange how it's possible to have a civil dialogue with people you disagree with.
So why are Gen Z voters so important this year?
Data shows they cast ballots at a higher rate than younger voters in the past and increasingly they're setting the agenda for this election.
"Bram Resnick, 12 News."
" Now, fears of a wider war in the Middle East are being felt also in the United States, including by Lebanese-American Mayor Abdullah Hamoud of Dearborn, Michigan, a state that's home to the nation's largest Arab-American population."
And Hamoud tells Michel Martin about the growing voter disaffection in his community and what it would take to restore their trust in the upcoming presidential election.
"Thanks, Christian."
"Mayor Abdullah Hamoud, thank you so much for speaking with us."
Thank you so much for having me.
"You are the first person of Arab descent to be elected mayor of Dearborn, which I think might be surprising to some people, given that Dearborn is a majority, you know, Arab-Muslim city."
You were in the statehouse before you became mayor.
But I was just wondering if you wouldn't mind taking us back to when you first ran and what made you run?
"This is the place that my parents first emigrated to, finding financial and social opportunity."
And Dearborn is a place in which I'm raising my own family.
"And I believe Dearborn to be the greatest American city there is, coast to coast."
"And for me, running for Dearborn, for mayor of Dearborn, was about the opportunity to improve the quality of life for all of our residents."
And we never ran to be the first anything.
"In fact, our mantra was running to be the best, to demonstrate that, you know, regardless of the direction in which I pray, the direction in which I lead is a strong direction and the direction in which that can uplift all the communities across the city of Dearborn."
And that's why we did it.
"As we are speaking now, it's been a year since the October 7th, you know, Hamas attack on southern Israel and all that has transpired since then."
"As we are speaking now, there is an aggressive military campaign going on in Lebanon, where your parents are from."
"I just wondered if you would just share a few vignettes, if you would, from what this past year has been like."
"You know, what I would say is when I ran for mayor, you know, I ran on the idea that I was going to ensure that residents' garbage was picked up on time."
And yet here I am talking about the crises that are unfolding thousands of miles away.
"But what I often tell folks is when there's an issue unfolding that impacts my residents directly, I have a responsibility to use a platform that has been privileged to me by the residents to speak up and to ensure that their voices are heard."
And that's what we've tried to do to the best of our ability over the last year.
"I can't say that I've done it perfectly or that I'm doing it just great, but I'm doing the best I can to elevate the voices in this time of deep pain for the tens of thousands of residents that have called me, contacted me, that have come to our council chambers talking about the sheer death and destruction that they see each and every single day."
"You know, for many Americans across this country, when they see the images of video surfacing all over social media, to them it's just images of strangers."
"For us here in the city of Dearborn, these are images of close family and friends, which makes that pain all the closer to us."
And so that's why I think I have a responsibility to speak up and use a platform I have to hopefully push for a change and course on what has been unfolding across the Middle East for as long as I've been alive.
"What are some of the stories that your residents, your constituents have told you, just, you know, one or two or three, even from your own family, if you don't mind?"
"Just yesterday, I got a call from a cousin who informed me that his sister-in-law was just obliterated to pieces."
"She was trying to escape her home in Lebanon and as she was walking out with her children, she was advancing to the car when a bomb had just dropped on the car and killed her in front of her children."
We had an instance where right now my stepsister is trapped in Lebanon and she has not been able to find a flight to come back to America where she lives with her husband and with her children.
I've had residents come when we first pushed the first ceasefire resolution for what's unfolding across Gaza to speak to the calamity that has struck their family.
One resident in the Pacific spoke to losing over 70 or 80 family and loved ones.
This is something that nobody can fathom and the pain is so deep that there's just a numbness to it.
"And unfortunately, as I described months ago, many in the city of Dearborn don't sleep."
"When my wife first woke up this morning at seven o'clock in the morning heading out to work, her first question to me was, what happened since we slept and when we woke up, that's unfolded overseas in these last five, six hours."
"And I think that's what is top of mind for so many residents, not only in Dearborn, all across the globe."
"So you're describing a sense of exhaustion, a sense of kind of helplessness."
"One of the reasons I think people know you, even if they don't live in or near Dearborn, is that you wrote an op-ed for the New York Times back in February where you described this sense of betrayal."
"As briefly as you can, say more about that."
What is that betrayal?
Many of us here in the city supported President Biden and his election efforts versus then President Donald Trump on the hope that he would bring morality and decency back to the White House.
"But what we have seen unfold over the last 11 months, the number, the numerous war crimes that have been committed, we have seen a president who has been unwilling to distance himself from the war criminal, Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet."
"That's why we feel so betrayed, that our president rather choose and side with Benjamin Netanyahu over the American people."
"You talked about the feeling that, you know, a lot of people come as immigrants."
They don't necessarily come from places where they have been allowed to or encouraged to participate in civic life.
And then they come here and then they're told to participate.
"And then they start feeling like no matter what they do, no matter how many phone calls they make, no matter how many peaceful demonstrations they participate in, no matter how many particular politicians they write, that it sort of doesn't matter."
"Does it still feel that way, that you're not being listened to?"
Has any of that changed?
We are at the cusp of a regional war unfolding across the entire Middle East.
We most certainly still feel that way.
"And what I would tell you right now is, you know, over 60 percent of Americans support an arms embargo against the Israeli government."
"Yet we have a president that has not moved on this issue, has just been unveiled that both USAID and the State Department have provided the report to the White House administration that Israel, the Israeli government did block humanitarian aid, which would permit now the American government from withholding weapons distribution towards the Israeli government, which it had not done."
"In fact, Secretary Blinken went to Congress and said anything but the truth."
"And so for us, we do at times feel as if all the protesting, all the yelling and screaming, trying to highlight the atrocities that are happening and unfolding are leading us to nowhere."
I think what we are trying to do and trying to understand is the center of America has moved on the issue of Israel and Palestine.
And what we'd love to see now is essential the Democratic Party to move as well.
"One of the reasons you also came to public attention back in February is that there has been a movement to encourage people to vote in the primaries, to vote uncommitted as an expression of their disagreement with the administration over its stance toward Israel and the Gaza war."
"OK, so that was the primaries."
"And there were significant numbers of people in both Wisconsin and Michigan, who are both important battleground states that did choose to vote sort of uncommitted."
What about now?
What is the feeling now about the best course of action?
"This is hotly debated across the community, whether it be at the Arab community, the Muslim community or the anti-war community at large."
The community is not a monolith.
I've had conversations with some individuals who feel that not voting at all because of the apathy that they feel and the demonstration that all the work that's happened over the last 11 months has led to nothing.
And I think that is the most catastrophic thing come November.
I had many of folk come forward and say they're looking towards a third party.
You have many of folks who are still in Vice President Harris' camp.
But I think what you're finding is the coalition that was built by Joe Biden to defeat Donald Trump four years ago is not tightly knit together.
It has been fractured because of the course that they have taken on the issue of Gaza and more broadly speaking across Palestine and Lebanon today.
"To the point of the third parties that you mentioned, a recent Reuters poll showed that 40 percent of Arab and Muslim voters in Michigan are now backing the Green Party candidate Jill Stein."
And Michigan was really important to Joe Biden's victory in 2020.
"I mean, Michigan is one of those states that went to Trump in 2016."
"The fact that Biden was able to win Michigan by—well, in, you know, 150,000 votes, not huge, given you're talking about millions of voters, was part of the reason that he is president now."
"But the fact is, Mr. Mayor, Jill Stein is not going to be president of the United States."
That's just not going to happen.
"So is this move toward Jill Stein, is that a political strategy?"
Or is that more a statement of anger?
What is that?
I agree.
"And I understand that come November, you really have one of two choices over who is going to win this election."
"Be it Vice President Harris or former President Trump, I want to understand electoral politics that we have at play."
"From the individuals that I've spoken to are supporting a third party candidate, for them, they're trying to vote with their values and morals at the forefront."
"They want a president who not only advocates for an assault weapons ban here in the states, but also ensures that we don't have cabinet members of the Israeli government passing out assault weapons to radical settlers killing Palestinians each and every single day."
"They want to support a president who understands that we have to end mass shooting at schools, but also holds accountable a government that decimated every university across Gaza."
We care about universal health care and we care about what's happening in Gaza.
We care about ensuring a green new future and what's unfolding in Yemen.
We care about centering worker and union's rights and also wanting to understand what's unfolding in Yemen.
And we're looking for a presidential candidate who takes these values and applies them globally.
"And so I think that's what you're hearing from folks who are going towards a third party candidate, be it Stein or someone else."
And that's really what they want.
People want to be inspired to vote for something.
"They don't want the simple message that Donald Trump is awful, which he is."
We understand what he represents.
"The Muslim ban, the annexation of the Golan Heights, elimination of all A towards Palestinians during his term."
We know exactly what he represents and what he would bring in the second term.
But the fear tactic is not going to work.
People want an inspirational reason to come out to the ballot come November.
"There's a group called the Uncommitted National Movement, which is a coalition of people who supported the idea of voting uncommitted in the primaries."
"The group claims to have about 700,000 people who support it."
"And last week, the movement announced it won't endorse Kamala Harris, but they did urge supporters to vote against Trump and avoid third party candidates."
So what does that mean?
"I understand you don't speak for this group, but what does that mean?"
"Yeah, I can't speak to the thought process that went into the messaging behind the Uncommitted National Movement's announcement."
"What I can tell you, though, is when you have conversations at the doorsteps with residents here in the city of Dearborn, where my primary concern is, there's a difference in belief."
"Again, you have folks who very much do support the vice president."
You have folks who very much are supporting a third party candidate.
But I think the largest voting bloc are those who are not considering coming out to vote at all.
"And if we recall the 2016 election, it wasn't that Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton by roughly 11000 votes in Michigan in 2016."
It was the fact that 80000 voters went out and skipped the presidential question in total.
And so I think that is the thing that we are trying to course correct for.
The message that I have is I endorse you voting come November.
"At the very minimum, you must come out and you must cast your ballot because standing on the sideline is not sufficient and it's not going to get us anywhere."
"And so we have to demonstrate our power, our power through our voice and our power through our vote."
"You are a Democrat yourself, but your position now is officially as mayor, as a nonpartisan position, if I have that right, right?"
"So that's the municipal elections are nonpartisan, as they are in lots of lots of places."
"OK, so on the one hand, you certainly have had the experience, I think, of having to ask people to support you, even if they don't agree with you about everything."
I don't know if you've talked to the Harris campaign about this or if they've reached out to you.
But how would you how would you suggest that they talk to voters about that?
That's a very difficult conversation.
"I mean, how would you approach a resident who had lost 70, 80 plus family members and tell them, regardless of what you've lost, the choice is between two and you must still cast your ballot one way or the other."
It's not an easy conversation to have.
Here's what I can tell you.
"For the last 20 years of my life, Arab Americans and Muslim Americans have made secondary the issues of foreign affairs."
"I can't tell you that between Bush, Obama, Trump or Biden, that we have had alignment or agreement on their global policies."
That's not been the case.
"What you're hearing now in this election that's different is I have been the first to say and I put so in my op ed, the transformative policies of President Biden are likened to those of Lyndon B. Johnson or FDR."
But a genocide outweighs all of this.
The conflict we're speaking to is unprecedented.
"You're talking about 2.2 million people where 100 percent are displaced, whether you're looking to the health ministry numbers or the Lancet Journal publication, the deaths are somewhere between 40,000 and 180,000, the majority of which are women and children, and 90 percent of civilian infrastructure has been decimated."
The U.N. estimates place that it would take over a decade just to eliminate the rubble and it would take multiple decades to rebuild.
We see what's happening now in the West Bank where the El Jazeta offices have been shuttered for the next 45 days.
We see the expansion of the war throughout Lebanon.
"And again, I'm getting phone calls from close immediate family members saying they're trapped or they have been killed or they have been injured."
And we're expected to say these issues that are fall secondary.
And so I think the grace that has to be awarded to this community and this point of time is that this issue is as has to be as prioritized as those that I spoke to domestically.
Has the Harris campaign reached out to you or have you reached out to them?
There have been many conversations when we first started with the Biden administration leading into with Harris Harris campaign individuals.
"And we've expressed these points time and time again that when it comes to this community here, the things that they're looking for at this point, it's beyond the ceasefire."
We have to understand that Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet are not looking to end this conflict.
He's looking to retain his political position within his government.
"And he's doing all he can to avoid a hostage deal, to bring all the hostages and prisoners home and to allow unfettered access to humanitarian aid."
You can't keep giving this this tyrant access to all the weapons and bombs that we manufacture.
An arms embargo needs to be imposed in order for us to bring him to the table so we can put resolution to this conflict that's unfolding and hopefully put forward a just solution in establishing a Palestinian state to end this conflict once and for all.
"The former president, the current candidate, Republican candidate, is not an untested quantity."
It's not a hypothetical.
He's made it clear where he stands.
"I mean, here's a person who used Palestinian almost as a slur."
I guess what I'm saying is it's a known quantity who's made it very clear that he stands solidly with Israel.
I know that he's promised and he has asserted that he will bring Middle East peace.
He has asserted this.
I know he's asserted this to constituents of yours in various ways.
"But his method of doing so, I find, would not I would venture to say would not be pleasing to most of your constituents."
"And so then the question becomes, what if Mr. Trump wins and all the things that you have supported and worked for and care about are undone?"
How will you answer that?
I am doing all that I can to prevent Donald Trump from being reelected.
And what I'm trying to do is use a platform that I have and urging the vice president to chart a new course on what's happening.
"Not because Dearborn residents are asking for it, not because Arab Americans and Muslim Americans are asking for it, because the center of the party that represents the center of this country has moved on its issues, whether it's an arms embargo, pursuing a ceasefire, ending the conflicts overseas."
These are all things that everyday Americans are calling for.
"And so if we can uphold that value and heed the concerns of Americans from coast to coast, we can work collectively to rebuild the coalition to prevent the reelection of Donald Trump."
But this is not about moving a constituency that is feeling deep pain.
This is about moving a candidate who is seeking the highest office in the globe on issues of morality.
And that is what we're trying to do in this moment of time.
"Obviously, elections start soon."
And that's why we are urging with all the power that we have.
"That's why you see a muddy draw out from the uncommitted national movement on messaging, because we understand what Donald Trump represents."
Nobody is here to debate that by any means.
We understand that ultimately you have a binary choice come this November.
But what is not binary is either are the positions that are being taken right now overseas.
And we have to usher in a new era to bring about just solutions to these decades long conflicts without.
So you are really losing people and leaving them behind at the wayside.
"Before you let you go, Mr. Mayor, how what you are juggling a lot of things and a family in addition to being mayor and in addition to trying to comfort, support and advocate for people."
What is your work in these next weeks going forward?
My work is centered on ensuring that that next generation has far greater opportunity and far less difficulty and being as American as they can be.
"And that, you know, a name like mine of the last and what is as American as any other in the city like Dearborn is the greatest American city because we are so diverse and beautiful."
We come together in these moments of struggle.
So that's my work is really centered around around making sure my residents have the comfort and support that they need in these dire times.
And I take my lead from them and I lean on them and these moments of difficulty because that's what Dearborn does.
"Mayor Abdullah Hamoud, Mayor of Dearborn, thank you so much for speaking with us."
I do hope we'll talk again.
Thank you so much for having me.
 Can we keep hearing about how this is a super tight race?
"Well, according to 538 National Polling, Donald Trump is leading Kamala Harris as the preferred president, 48% to 46%."
"But as we know, it's the battleground states that will decide who's the next commander in chief."
Joining us now is New York pollster and founder of John Zogby Strategies.
"John Zogby, thank you so much for joining us on Power Hour."
"Hi Gabriel, how are you?"
"Well, thank you."
Thank you for joining us.
Excited to really break down the numbers.
What's your assessment firstly of where they're at at the moment when you look at Donald Trump and Kamala Harris?
"You know, amidst all the turbulence and conflict that we hear about this campaign, the fact is we're at equilibrium."
"I mean, this is about as close as it gets."
"And you know, there may be an event and Kamala Harris gets a bump and another assassination attempt, Donald Trump gets a bump."
But the fact of the matter is it always finds its way back to about as close to a tie as you can get.
"Yeah, it's interesting."
A Quinnipiac University national poll showed that Donald Trump is just ahead at 48% to Kamala Harris is 47%.
But then CNN's latest findings showed that Kamala Harris is at 48% and Mr. Trump is at 47%.
"So as you say, it's just as close as it gets."
"But looking at those numbers, it doesn't really matter who's the most popular."
Is that right?
"Well, it does."
"I mean, in the sense that given the way our electoral college is structured, Kamala Harris needs to be at least three and a half to four percentage points ahead of Donald Trump because of the popular vote, she gets a lot of extra votes, popular votes in California and Illinois and New York, large states."
"But no, you're absolutely right."
"It all comes down to seven states, Southern Rim, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia."
And then what we call the Northern Wall.
"And that is Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania."
And there's all sorts of scenarios here.
"For example, while when Joe Biden was still in, the anticipation was that the Democrats would lose the Southern Rim, which meant then that Joe Biden would have to win all three of the Northern Wall and then pick up two more electoral votes, one in Nebraska and one in Maine."
That's how kind of crazy this is.
Both candidates are putting a lot of time in Pennsylvania.
Is there a state you view as the most important?
It is Pennsylvania.
"It is a battleground state, it's tied and has the largest number of electoral votes."
The path to victory is through Pennsylvania.
"Do you expect there's gonna be a big shift in the polls between now and November five, or is it going to stay as close as it is at the moment?"
"Well, you know, look at in a world where anything can happen in US politics, anything has already happened several times."
"We've got what, 42 or 43 more days to go."
Anything more can happen several times.
"And so I don't even venture a prediction, but I suspect we'll be at equilibrium for a while."
A pollster is undercounting Donald Trump's voter support.
"Yeah, you know, there are some pollsters, I think, who under represent Republicans."
"And my experience, and it's 40 years now, Republicans appear to be less likely to answer the phone or to respond to surveys."
"Folks like me, I've always adjusted my sample and applied in a little extra weight, you know, to make sure that Republicans are equitably, not equally necessarily, but equitably represented to reflect, you know, how people have voted in presidential elections."
Some don't.
And sometimes I do see some of the big name pollsters coming in with samples that over sample Democrats and under sample Republicans.
I'm a little suspicious.
"And no, I'm not gonna mention any names."
"Okay, look, an NBC national news poll put Kamala Harris's favorability jumping 16 points since July."
Yes.
That's massive.
What do you put that down to?
"Well, you know, the book on Kamala Harris was that she was a do-nothing vice president, that the White House itself didn't trust her, and that she was harsh."
"But, you know, once she became the candidate, there was a change in the conversation."
There was the smile and the laugh.
She's very good out there.
"Plus, let's admit it, she's gotten a bit of a nice honeymoon from the press."
"Oh, she absolutely has."
I think the mainstream left-wing media has a fair bit to do with that.
"Final question, if this election were to be held tomorrow, where would you be putting your money?"
"Oh, I'm not putting my money anywhere yet at all."
"If you're gonna place a bet, don't come to me just yet."
I'll tell you when.
Fair enough.
We'll have to chat again between now and November 5.
John Zogby from John Zogby Strategy.
Thank you so much for joining us on Tower Hour.
Thank you.
