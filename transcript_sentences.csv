"Biden received 28 percent support among self-identified independents, a figure that rose to 30 percent for Harris."
Is there any policies or anything that she would change?
And it's clear Donald Trump is having a whole lot of buyer's remorse.
"Of course, if you told him about the transitive property, he'd be like, I don't know in that one, so I don't know what you're talking about."
"Look, I grew up in the middle class."
It just is.
I'm calling it.

"Kamala Harris, till the time that she became the contender, was not seen as a vice president who performed so superbly well."
I'm sure Republicans and Democrats will probably not Democrats.
He needs just he wants to finish his speech.
And you're already seeing Donald Trump obviously talk about this as a campaign issue.
Where can I find you?
"Not everybody has money in the market, et cetera."
"So, you know, the kind of belief that because Pennsylvania is fracking central outside of Texas, it is not on the minds of the average voters, not on the minds of black voters."
And it's not helping his campaign.
"Now there's two key points after that, though."
"So we talked about this last time in the local stream, which you can join on the doobly-doo below."
"The catch here is that among this group of voters, black voters specifically talking about these voters, they tend to lag behind white voters when it comes to voter turnout."
Does anyone really expect her to win?
Let's get it.
"When Biden visited his boyhood home of Scranton this month, local professor Adam Sprinson says it made sense politically for him to flex his roots."
And but he did.
Former president Obama called out black male voters last week.
"Now, I know a lot of people are out there saying, whoa, what if he would have picked Josh Shapiro?"
And I think my polling that we put out the Trump tied in Pennsylvania is to left because of the sample and the internal demographics.
He said he was going to take more questions than he raps.
 All you hear is that the Democrats are the ones with the amazing ground game and the Republicans less so.
I'm now you're deep.
And that's when all this other stuff really starts pouring in.
"And while I do think that's entirely fair, right?"
"They don't, like I say, they don't want a felon to get back in there because we know he caused a insurrection and they're scared of a woman."
"Minister, Minister Obama right there, boys."
"254, top right at the screen, 226 for the Dems."
The same people will be behind the scenes running the country because Kamala is incompetent.
As Newsom did.
We're at 20 minutes.
"I am here with my colleague Dan Snyder here from CBS Philadelphia, and we set out, Dan, to try to get a pulse post-verdict if anyone swung one way or another."
"Hi, my name is Dave Trotter."
Why would you say her name?
"So they really do need to make inroads, top Democrats."
" Essentially, if Biden loses Pennsylvania, the only way he could realistically even have a shot at the White House is he'd need to flip North Carolina."
I think he wanted a direct response.
You think you need...
"And of course, if you're watching this and for whatever reason you are not yet subscribed to this YouTube channel that you're watching right now, Jesse Dolomur's channel, please rectify that oversight immediately and subscribe!"
He's done so much for our country and he's going to make an extraordinary Vice President of the United States.

You're totally right.
"The Rough draft the final draft the final edit Um, you know, it's wild."
"I mean, if we all collectively had a dollar for every time we talk to someone that said, you know, I don't like the way he speaks, but you know, I'm not voting for him because I think he's a great person."

So I don't know what your two what your the impressions are for either of you about the state of polling.
Melendez moved from Puerto Rico with her family when she was 14.
"Once you cross that threshold, you win, and the other candidate loses."
It's very likely that the polls are overestimating Trump's support.
So we have a equal opportunity in this America in this country So that's a good thing for us.
"Hey there, Jesse."
Take a look with Kamala Harris having a one point edge over former President Donald Trump nationally.
"I'm hearing reports about Trump signs scattered all across Philly, especially South Philly."
"A lot of that is fueled by guilt because they have all this money and resources in the community in the inner city, Philadelphia, Dutton."
"Emerson, Insider Advantage, Tipp, Trafalgar, or do you trust the New York Times, Quinnipiac and Bloomberg?"
And this is worrisome for her campaign for obvious reasons.
Pennsylvania is the most important state in the election.
Kamala doesn't give a frack about you.
"It's never, when you can never win, you can never win."
"As the saying goes, if you're not at the table, you're on the menu."
You cannot tell me that.
It's what it is.
They are.
These are like close to max.
"This idea that she's going to magically do better than Joe in places like Scranton, Erie, even Pittsburgh, maybe the suburbs, maybe?"
Can you hear that?
"So anyway, the secret service said that the UDA was fired multiple shots from a elevated position outside of the rally before he was on a live by agents."

Teamsters union in Michigan.
Trump had crippled Iran.
These are deeply serious conditions that clearly impact her functioning.

Certainly a strong message there and Tim Walz as we know was on ABC's The View Today and Selina it seemed that perhaps he was a little more prepared to answer the question of how a Harris-Walls administration might differ from the current Biden-Harris administration what are we hearing from him?
"It's a very, very funny link in the description, though, not archived."
"Harris tweeted about the importance of building a clean energy economy, advancing environmental justice, and increasing resilience to climate disasters."
He's definitely gonna win big there again.
"Some are saying it is staged, it is not viewed, some are saying they just automatically make him the president with this incident because he's going to start acting like a victim."
He chose the Hallelujah.
"I think I say Wilkes-Barre, most of all."
It's a bold move cotton.
And I think what gets me is that any self-respecting veteran couldn't support somebody who even hints at using the military against civilians based on voting or based on what they think is a conspiracy theory of another stolen election.
" Well, the polls are going back and forth like the final seconds of a close NBA game."
That didn't happen.
Trump is doing better.
And that's Kamala Harris.
"And that's why I think the Harris campaign, they're kind of freaking out because if Josh Shapiro wasn't enough to save them, how are you going to win?"
"And also on top of that with the voter registration with all the recent polls where Trump's outperforming his numbers in 2020 and 2016 and he won in 2016 and he barely lost in 2020, Pennsylvania is looking really good that you can see the data with Biden winning the state by 81 K. This is huge news for Trump's election chances because it means democratic mail and enthusiasm is falling off and not just by more than Republicans and raw numbers, but at twice the rate 2020 was a pandemic year."
"Yeah heard about that, but it depends and What you what news are you going to?"

"Her too, her too."
"Both Harris and Trump are putting Pennsylvania in the spotlight, knowing that the state's voters could very well decide the outcome of the election."
So the target here today is on those voters.
"One of the negatives on this poll is that they interview three quarters are white, all right, and generally speaking, the whites are gonna vote for Trump."
"It they understated Trump by a lot until the very end, when by some miracle, the polls became very close."
"Today is Saturday, August 10th, 2024, and this morning, the New York Times and Sienna College released an A plus poll across three battleground states, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, showing Kamala Harris with a four-point lead in every single battleground state."
Was that hard?
I was loyal to Barack Obama when I cut my own path as president.
"You know, if Zelensky is the greatest salesman in history, then the only better salesman has to be Vladimir Putin, who has successfully conned a US president, a former US president, and half of the country into thinking that he is favorable to the US."

Does she need Josh Shapiro to secure the White House?
"Walkers to what that, the significance of that, because I think a lot of people from, from the, from that perspective, don't realize how much of a fail that was, not only for JD Vance, who, who was able to fail onto himself, just a virtue of opening his mouth and existing, but also the campaign to walk into a shop that was, that was not only neutral on him, but kind of openly hostile to the, to the thought of him being there."
I'm just saying that you can't underestimate the stupidity of the general public and how many NPCs there are in this election.
It's going to be a tough fight.
"Liz back to you, Natalie."
"If I ever did that, all of those people back there, look at them, look at all those cameras."
So I got to be the arbiter of morality.
Kamala Harris now has a 10 point advantage over Donald Trump in the swing state betting odds a week ago.
"And I think as the Kamala Harris and Tim Walz campaign has been driving home on that point, it's something that's resonating in places especially like Pennsylvania with such a high percentage of blue collar workers."

So take this to the bank.

"Here, Donald Trump told people to go out and vote on January 5th."
"Political writer at the Los Angeles Times, Sima Mehta, told us both candidates are sharpening their attacks in those key states."
I think we get taken for granted that they're just going to look at the ballot and go all the way down and not even read it.
And you have and you yourself have been spending some time in western Pennsylvania correct?
"So poorly she was behind Pete, booty gig, Amy Klobuchar, all these randos on a democratic side."
"But do you really believe that Kamala Harris has more appeal to blue collar voters that most of them were Democrats just 10 years ago than Joe Biden did, especially in Pennsylvania?"
"There's a very slim number of truly undecided voters and they're they're very kind of diverse group, like understanding exactly what they're what's holding them back is challenging."
I started that in... Can you show me?
"So, Mary Alice, you you're in Pennsylvania right now where Vice President Kamala Harris held a rally last night."

"But assuming that Donald Trump wins those states, Pennsylvania is the ball game."
"And when it comes to crucial battleground states, well, the candidates are effectively even, with Harris up by just one percentage point."
Bye.
"And when he does, the reaction he gets from minorities or just young people in general is just it's outstanding."
And we had to leave.
"A lot of people in Pennsylvania, that whole ordeal, he has a special place in the hearts of many Americans."
What's the latest there?

He says Democrats rigged the election in 2020 and he's not going to let them get away with it this year.
He never led the polls in really any of these states going back to 2016 or 2020.
He blamed a lack of air conditioning and called for music to be played.
Both presidential candidates know the road to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is likely paved through the state itself.
So why is Trump campaigning in California and New York?
" Now, perhaps the single biggest lie that Harris told her in the debate on Tuesday, a little bit under the radar, it came toward the end of the night when she said, quote, I've made very clear my position on fracking."
There is.
It might be shaping the outcome of the election itself.
"And given the assassination attempt, sort of the the entire the strengthening of Trump's base and sort of the invigoration into the campaign ever since that attempt, I think that that's something that I said has become very symbolic for the Republican Party."
"In Pennsylvania, which has a high number of electoral votes, the party with the most votes will be one step closer to becoming the next president of the United States."
"If you had to bet on it, do you think that's what he looks like with his shirt up?"

There was birth that there was birth that happened in the sky.
"So like a 5149 poll, for example, would be better than this, even though the margin is smaller, even though the margin is smaller, right?"

My wife wanted to come to this.
Nice too.

"But the thing about this cycle is that when you look at the polling, when you talk to some of these pollsters and folks who are in the focus groups actually talking to voters, the thing that is top of mind for them is actually not abortion."
See it there?
"For example, a truck delivering groceries, fresh produce, say, if they don't factor in the cost of fuel to make the deliveries, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' high gas prices would make it so that the trucking company loses money."
But then we also had a Trump rally in Arizona.
This is the story of this person.
"So here in Pennsylvania, I say to those who know best when freedom is on the line, Americans always answer the call."
And he sees Kamala Harris as more liberal than he would like.
Cuban Americans.
They traveled here to support him.
Why people love Trump?
We're speaking for everybody here.
You see that there Franklin and Marshall.
"Reg Boulding, Dan Scarpanato, thanks so much for joining us."
Those campaign managers aren't idiots.
We'll see what they do.
"I mean, this is not just any random state."
They loved Kamala up until like two weeks ago.
You just need to.
What they find is that Bob Casey's up double digits.
"And when he was presented even with bipartisan legislation to try to stop the proliferation of guns, he did nothing."
"I do think that Quinnipiac has a very streaky history of over inflating the Democratic candidates margin, at least with Biden in 2020 and Harrison 2016."
"And when you get the Congressional Medal of Honor, I always consider that to be the ultimate, but it is a painful thing to get it."
"Harris has expanded her campaign efforts into these regions, including Beaver County, Lancaster County and Fayette County, to connect with voters who may not be as familiar with her."
This is a painting I started last night.
"But Erie County of all the counties in Pennsylvania, Erie County is the one that is most representative of what's going on in the entire state."
"But yeah, both sides are really just coming in hot with the personal attacks and policy seems to be a distant second here."
That's well above what it is in terms of Pennsylvania as a whole.
Three percent of voters are still undecided.
"I hate that kind of mentality, but as I close, I want to say this, shout out to all the rich white liberals in Pennsylvania."
"But I also think she probably got the vibe from the skies like he's not a team player, he's not a team player."

The campaign in the coming months is expected to continue intensifying with more resources and time invested in this state.
"You can see when it was a Biden versus Trump rematch, we saw that Biden was down nationally, two, three points on average."
But now it's still a Trump lead.
"Ohio has long been considered a bellwether state in presidential elections, often reflecting the national mood."
The Washington Post.
Was that part of the program?
"But what I know is it's a call for violence, plain and simple."
But it's also important to have that one in one contact to go to a county fair to engage with people to answer their questions.
"I mean, and I that's part of why I was bullish on the fact that I thought she could be an candidate that generated enthusiasm when most people were saying she's an idiot, she's a bad campaigner."
Harris over the weekend kind of go to Trump and saying that he believes that she believes his handlers don't want the mic to be on because they're afraid of what he might say.
They're trying to make it.
What did he tell you?
So I think she sees this as an opportunity and a good one.
That's looking at the final choices.
Harris has less than a single percentage point lead there.
You have folks who very much are supporting a third party candidate.
"Trump, meanwhile, may need to pivot his strategy to address the specific concerns of Nevada voters, including those related to the tourism and hospitality industries, which are vital to the state's economy."
"I think it's a great question, and that concern is definitely out there."
So you had dozens of Republicans that were endorsed her.
A pollster is undercounting Donald Trump's voter support.
That is fine for Pennsylvania.
"This is a classic Washington case where if you know you ain't talking, if you talking, you don't know."
What do you think is happening in Wisconsin with Catholic voters if if Notre Dame shifted this Republican in just four years?

He's not even giving us a choice.
"I don't know, it could be one reason."
"Brandon, so let's talk about what a win in Pennsylvania means for the candidates and how crucial is it?"
A one point swing in Wisconsin and Michigan means Trump is president of the United States.
"So if folks out there are concerned about this issue or concerned about costs, but if you're just concerned about keeping a majority in the United States Senate, I hope they will help us by going to bobkasey.com."

"And Kathy Barnett, actually, who started off her political career by being the Kim Klasek of Pennsylvania, she ran in a deep blue district, but she's actually ran a solid campaign on the issue."
But of course we know the real reason they do not want actual election integrity.
Where would you rate yourself?
That's about 30% of the GOP casting a protest vote against Donald Trump.
So don't come to me with that.
"They're not the ones, obviously, but it's not everything."
Kamala Harris is ready to do the job.
It truly take those words seriously.
"If the trend holds and Harris secures Pennsylvania along with Michigan and Wisconsin, she is all but guaranteed to win the presidency."
 A president show Biden and former president Donald Trump will battle it out at the ballot box in Pennsylvania in just a few days as voters head to the polls on Tuesday for the commonwealth's primary.

That would make sense.

"No, it's okay."
"I think it goes back to, again, a lot of my background and my upbringing is because of my faith and that's why I care about a lot of issues and that's why I align it with those things."
We were just talking about Trump's value in a Republican primary with the broader electorate.
He's the smartest and the greatest and the richest.
I'm going to suggest that that is probably the moment where things really started to go sideways.
"In fact, Casey's lead over McCormick has been shrinking in recent weeks."
Will there be a five point miss?
The news is fake.
"You're the former head of the Freedom Caucus, Republican who's who's held a seat there for more than a decade."
"Recently, you were writing more about the history of the blue wall, how Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin have voted the same way in every presidential election since 1980, save one."

 Good to see you here.
Previously it appeared that the race post debate had frozen in place with neither candidate with any clear momentum.
He's going to say that they all conspired against him.
"Came straight to the comments, someone said everybody wants to know, so he's not a lot of real favorable comments there, saying why don't you just show up on The View and have a nice slot there right next to Whoopi."
We're seeing some pictures likely from earlier of a motorcade being taken out and security personnel and camouflage heading in with long guns surely trying to secure the area.
So this is actually I think like the first sort of nonpartisan reputable pollster we've had in a while.
We'll leave no doubt about who we are and what America stands for.
"On the counter, women under 40 and women across the board and seniors now for the first time since 2000 are moving in line with Kamala Harris."
"But I think the other thing that people often should remember, you know, they're different people."

He's my friend.
It has everything to do with what I'm seeing on the ground.
"I mean, those voters in a way they could decide the twenty twenty four election."
So we're doing a lot.
"So we have been going to gunshowtrader.com the last year, visiting every single gun show, going to every single gun store, archery range."
And how would you describe the Republican Party now?
"And so we were like, I wonder if we could get her."
How might that be part of the bus tour stop from the Harris campaign through your state this week?
"And so point being, it's a demonstration of one of the things that Democrats say they really wanted out of a Harris candidacy, which is someone who could inject a new sense of optimism and a new sense of momentum into this party."

"I think humans are humans and everybody deserves a fair chance, you know, to make a living and make their Children, their Children's place, their Children's place and it divides Children and families and moms."
Democrats criticized him for it.
"So each daily margin gain may be smaller, but for the Democratic Party, they trying to get this firewall up to 390,000 votes."

"Coming to his defense, Russian state media weighed in on Donald Trump's mental ability, asserting that questions about his fitness for office was all democratic propaganda."

Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote and Donald Trump 46%.
I've looked at some of the polling in your state.
"Good morning, Terry Good morning, George Donald Trump came here to the suburbs of Philadelphia one of the critical battlegrounds in this battleground state looking for votes But as you say that town hall event that he held quickly turned into something very different when the candidate turned into a DJ a overnight Donald Trump in his 11th trip to must win, Pennsylvania Urged his supporters to turn out on election day."

"Oh, yes Absolutely."
"While Trump's proposal targets reducing individual tax bills, his broader economic plans focus on offering tax relief to the companies operating within the United States."

"No, those were all the jobs."
"Ergo, she's tough on crime."
"Like, we're talking about a presidential election, guys."
We're out here today in Pennsylvania head of this Trump rally Can you tell me a little bit more about why you guys decided to come out?
"Then we heard him on the microphone, Shannon, saying, let me grab my shoes as they tried to take them off."
You think literal tapes.
So I absolutely love Trump.
He doesn't want illegal immigrants as this was the same agenda when he was when he was a president four years ago.
"What's going on in this election, and this is after the conviction, Donald Trump seeing a bump in the state of Pennsylvania in a pollster that is not friendly for him, and it's not friendly for Republicans, and it makes sense."

"And even political opponents, people on the other side of the aisle."
"A huge, huge, huge ad reservation dump, one that will benefit the Democratic Party quite tremendously in a way that she Kamala Harris is already starting to do."
"Okay, here we go."
And there was clear instances of cheating.
Those are areas where she could really draw separation with herself and Joe Biden.
A key reason for Trump's resurgence could be his increasingly dark language about immigrants in the United States.
I think that he can win in a statistical tie.
And there's no true test and courage under fire.
I'm responding to the point you're raising.
"He would have to flip Georgia and Pennsylvania, both of those States."
Which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down when what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.

"Pennsylvania, they passed a law that they couldn't count them until election day."
"In many ways, that they're trying to get people to look forward at that."

"Meanwhile, sources say Trump's preparation has included reviewing policy positions with advisers."
Everyone's against post-birth abortion.
"Well, this is kind of emerging of two things, right?"
Matt Gorman and Caitlin Huey-Burns are with us now here at the table in Washington.
Liberals try and say like they way overestimated conservatives in every single state.
But his age is also an issue.
Donald Trump gets lost telling a story about marble columns.
Hope you've subscribed so you don't miss out on a single episode.
I will predict this.
She's ready to be commander in chief and she released her medical records.
I definitely think we will surpass the 2020 numbers.
This comparison is an example of how the two parties are ideologically opposed to one another.
"We are here in Erie, Pennsylvania, lovely."
"They follow the lead of the Secret Service, i.e."
"Like, okay, it's better than Joe, but it seems like the enthusiasm search, which now it looks like it was just an artificial surge by the media."
That's not enough to get to 70.
"In Pennsylvania, it's fracking."
You got to tell people we got to vote.
It's a 13 times uptake than what it's normally seen.
"Now, Trump's focus on tax cuts remains central to his 2024 campaign."
"And so they also found that amongst voter demographics, Kamala Harris performed better than Biden did with key Democratic coalitions, doing better amongst black voters in these swing states and younger voters, and also gaining ground with older voters that can explain why Kamala Harris is ahead by four points when Biden only won Wisconsin by one, or Pennsylvania by one, or Michigan by three."
"However, Trump has maintained strong support in more rural parts of the state, particularly in the central and western regions, which are predominantly white and working class."
None of it affected him.
And I asked people from both sides why they wanted to be here today.
I hope everyone is okay.
And you could argue that's the reason he won Pennsylvania.
"So despite of these incidents, open AI has confirmed that none of the efforts to influence global elections have gained significant traction or large audiences."
"Lone Star State is an emerging battleground as Joe Biden received 46.5% of votes in the 2020 election, the highest vote share for a Democrat since Texas last went blue in 1976."
Harris is going to represent a no vote against things that have been perceived has been going on for some time.
And that is something that is viable.
So what that exactly mean for America that means illegal immigrants.
It's absolutely possible.
"And he has very much leaned into trying to target men, not just conservative men, but sort of socially liberal men, Latino men, black men."
What do we really want in a leader?
Democrats win the state of Pennsylvania.
"Practically every recent poll here, besides Harvard Harris and Russ Musken, show Kamala Harris leading."
Tell me about your dad.
She brings joy to this.
"You really have to hold up your margins everywhere, and that's what we're here to do."
"I was at the Golden Gate Bridge today and I was taking the stroll, talking to average Americans, the American voters."
"His experience in the classroom and his service to the country have shaped his leadership style, which emphasizes pragmatism and a commitment to working families."
"Think Arizona, Georgia."
"Well, what model is this exactly?"
"Now, papers do, and you just write on a sheet of paper, concept of a plan."
"Whereas 44 percent of likely voters have a favorable view of Trump, compared to 53 percent who do not, that is unchanged from August."
I like him.
So beautiful drawing.
"Which is the whole point of what's going on here because as politically, a political analyst would say, it is the undecided people who will decide the direction Pennsylvania goes."
Explain to me that this is an example of how terrible the legal court system is.
"Listen, man."
 Internal polling experts are agreeing.
We backed off.
They're trying hard.
How do you think it resonated with folks?
"So I mean, there is a track record, especially on the border."
"Well, you know, they usually have underestimated Trump by around six to seven points."
32% were under the age of 45.
"And like votes are still coming in, but Nikki Haley received over 100,000 votes."
But look at Harris voters.
"Listen, potent pondering, get in the comments."
It's like if you were cutting something with scissors or a knife and the blade is wiggling.
"The first stop was in Butler, Pennsylvania."
I do.
Just like the economy when it's run by Donald J. fucking Trump.
What do you make of him talking about the enemy within?
But you can make the case for the others.
"As of a couple of days ago, and these numbers actually have been updated, Democrats are not even at 60%."
The race started out in the teens.
You could do that and be a stone cold stomp down liberal in your heart.
"If you're starting a small business, Kamala Harris will give you a $50,000 tax credit to help you get it off the ground."
And so that's why I think I have a responsibility to speak up and use a platform I have to hopefully push for a change and course on what has been unfolding across the Middle East for as long as I've been alive.
He continues to say that he won Pennsylvania twice.
I'm not that.
"Multiple sources close to the campaign tell NBC News that Harris's running mate will make their debut at a rally in Philadelphia tomorrow, and that the announcement most likely will come in a text that's sent to high-ranking Democrats, which is the same way they did it when President Biden picked Harris."
"A significant amount of those people are not gonna approve of Heels Up Harris, that's just a fact."
This is a big one.
So that really is going to possibly help Trump because the Democrats are still divided on Israel and Hamas issue.
"So, he's well enough to start... And I do think it is absolutely important to say to you that there is no question that Donald Trump has been fatally injured."
I think I'm much better.
"Harris 48, Trump 47."
And you see Harris at 49 percent.
She was asked very a very simple question.
"Many accused Obama, who was also the first black American President, of doing nothing for the black community."
"Well, I don't think the rambling is the problem."
"Biden's success was largely driven by strong support in the suburbs of Philadelphia, as well as high turnout among African-American voters in urban areas like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia."
He elected to have the final statement of the night.
That's racist.
They're signing shells to bomb Russia from the United States made in America.
"Now, he's kind of been in the shortlist for a while now."
"And the conversations which included Liu and Harris's deputy chief of staff called Sergio, the leaders asked for a greater presence at local events."
It's a code and it's a broken Hallelujah.
"I want Pennsylvania to continue to get its fair share from the federal government, to have a president that I can call and lean on when times are tough, when like we did when I-95 collapsed, we had a president who we could call who would be there for us."
Let me know if you've seen that video in the comments.
"You know, I see even our organic food is being tested and they're finding lead and cadmium in it."
He went to college in the state.
"In fact, Elon Musk fiercely campaigned for former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump in that same campaign rally in Butler."
He hates her.
"He was up about 600,000 votes in Pennsylvania."
"And meanwhile, the Trump force 47 is launching in Arizona with the grand opening of a new office in Phoenix."
"Code enforcement comes around, they can write a citation but we haven't seen them yet."
"He was up 4% on this day, September 19th in 2020, and Hillary Clinton was up 6.6 points in 2016."
"Hey, man, I hope this is the tide turns."
And so that is good news when it comes to Pennsylvania right there.
"And I think that's one of the plans moving forward is when you look at the American people, most middle class families, their number one asset is actually their home."
And I can tell you tangibly that we are out registering the Democrats in terms of mail-in ballots in Mifflin County and Amish County in the center of the state and Juniata County and Amish County in the center of the state.
But the question is reassuring people that she's on top and that she has specific policies that people want to hear about.
But at the same time you have Mitch McConnell bitching about him in his book and saying weird shit.
Data shows they cast ballots at a higher rate than younger voters in the past and increasingly they're setting the agenda for this election.
Dan.
"Joe Delano, John Delano rather, joins us now."
"Now Dana Bash's credit, what she just asked her there was, well, you said that your values have not changed."
There's no question about it went Obama in 2012 when Trump in 2016 when Biden in 2020 the last two cycles just about 1500 votes each Separated the two candidates who we wanted to ask voters who have not made a firm decision yet who they want to vote for What they actually saw in this debate now These are voters that have in the past supported Republicans and Democrats they have in the past shown support for Former president Trump or for Joe Biden but coming into this night They told us that they had not made up their minds yet in this election So just to step back a little bit show our focus group to people Erie residents again Most important state most important County in that state We asked for a show of hands before the debate who hadn't made up their mind yet But thought this debate may determine where they would go with their vote to start With this debate.
And that's what Kamala Harris is doing.
Well guess what?
"And they don't know why they should trust Kamala Hara, who's had four years to do something and hasn't done anything and now is acting like she's going to change all this around."
"And the article does mention that some Democrats are feeling more hopeful with her on board, but it's still a big challenge."
And so go check it out and don't miss this one.
"She can sell herself to voters there, given her record on energy and some other issues as well."
And that's what you're going to continue to see.
"CBS News election survey executive director Anthony Salvanto explained earlier today, there is one factor contributing to how close this race is."
And now he has a plan to turn America into the quote crypto capital of the world.
I would wait.
Candidates are not allowed pre written notes on stage and microphones will be muted when it's not their turn to speak.
He almost won it in 2016.
She had none.
It's strange.
"Boom, boom, boom."
Rising costs.
"So that third party vote shares really capped them, which also makes sense why RFK Jr. backed out of the race and endorsed him because he kind of got his support gutted with this switch up on the Democratic side."
We saw a lot of people doing absentee ballots.
"Specifically, he believes that this presents a strategic contrast to the campaign that is currently being run by Donald Trump, who was previously the President of the United States."
Why not?
Are these extremely articulate?
"Kelly tells me that the Trump campaign told her that the former president will honor their family on Saturday, and she says they'll get a chance to meet with Trump before he speaks, and they may even be called on stage."
" Matters concerning the economy on the one hand and industry on the other, including the steel industry, as well as the mining industry, were key messages that flowed from the rally Donald Trump just held."
"Joining us now is Caitlin Becker, who is live in Bucks County."
"We have an AK-47 inside and people say, you know what, let's just and I don't, I knew about an AK-47 from a few weeks ago."

Ryan made.
Thanks Daniel for joining us here today on US Election Watch.

She's going to be hitting these blue wall states.
"This is my first one, I'm very excited."
"As you mentioned, Governor Shapiro meeting with Vice President Harris today in D.C."

Are you the only one with these?
"Selena thanks for being here with us and we know that polls are tightening in this race and the vice president today again stopping in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin states that make up this Democrats right so-called blue wall."
Amrit Pal tell us how's the buzz there for US elections and what are people saying with not even a month remaining for the elections?
That last yard and a half to get to the other side is hard.
They loved and loved and loved.
For sure.
 Poet and pondering back with another video.
Nobody did.
That's what Politico is reporting.
" Hello, Tucson!"
"In a related context, Donald Trump, during an interview with Musk, reiterated his belief that the Ukraine invasion would not have occurred under his presidency, while simultaneously calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky honorable despite past controversies."
Watch where the candidates spend their time.
"So you can see Heels Up and President Trump are 48, 48, all right?"
"You have a right to say that, but I got a right to believe what I want to believe."
I am here to ask you to vote.
"There's a lot of love and excitement, and everybody's happy."
"No, Siri, it is not."
I just don't think it's going to happen.
But I am not here just to talk about football.
United States middle class.
The vice president and her new running mate lavishing praise on one another last night as support porters screamed in favor of the pick.
"We'll see, but his lead actually expands when you look at it."
I think it's completely insane.

"Unlike Mike Pence, unlike Donald Trump, she was able to turn it around."
That's gonna happen.
"Social issues, including abortion rights and gun control, are also likely to play a significant role in the 2020 four-election."

"Just last week, I mean, I talked about this."
It is good to be back in Tucson.

The former president had to be tackled and taken off stage by a Secret Service with blood appearing to come from his head that a crowd of thousands at a presidential rally had to hit the ground some of them colliding with each other equipment falling on their heads and our heads at one point no matter what this ends up being this was a security failure at an event that is secured by the US Secret Service in any number of other law enforcement agencies where everybody in the space had to be screened and wanted by metal detectors and officers.
And they're taking in from the Trump campaign and how that's being received by the voters you're talking to.
"Okay, okay."

"Issues like racial equality, health care and education are often key concerns for this group."

That's his idea of freedom.
President Trump is himself.
"Among other things, this Summit for the Future serves to show these perspectives of expected developments in the world for the future and how the United Nations should prepare and respond."
So we'll see how Pennsylvania shakes out.
It should.
But I think that there's still a lot of concerns and it's not clear in people's minds whether things were really any better under Donald Trump than they are under Joe Biden.
This is my opinion.
But now what Pennsylvania voters are looking at is Donald Trump's awful track record on manufacturing jobs and his awful job record overall.
There was a secret accord.
"So first off, he says, they say I'm rambling, but I don't ramble."
You get all these exclusive videos.

They don't tell you that part.
So it's fair to say Dr. Oz did not receive an entirely warm greeting.
"Thompson, who has a deep interest in economic stability and growth, supports Harris' fiscal policies, which he believes will drive long-term economic success."
A saying the salad.

He's saying that he would use the military to go after them.
Both sides agree to disagree.

Health issues is like three or four health problems combined with it.
"We could do another question or two if you'd like, but probably do you want to do one?"
"Let me show you all the Trump signs, all the Trump stuff around here."
Our Nancy Cordes was there and joins us now with more on this.

I think it's not too different than the rest of the country.
"What do you think of the tone of the ads you're seeing, whether Republican, Democrat or other?"
And the crazy thing about it is the person responsible is not even black.
So not only is the vote share just weighed down but the percentages are just awful for Democrats.
Are you voting for Donald Trump?
"I don't think that he would undercut Harris, she added."
"It shows Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by two points, with Harris polling at 49% and Trump at 47%."
What about now?
Huge.
Can you tell us a little bit more about that anticipation that it hasn't just been going on today?
"Biden took the state, so Harris absolutely can take the state too."
He's totally lost the thread on that because he just rambled his way out of what he was actually campaigning on.

So that means they have to play spoiler and Trump becomes president.
The morning consult polls really add fuel to the fire.
"Hit subscribe, everybody."
Remember Van Jones.
It's just not true Now the claims are getting even more bizarre Marjorie Taylor Greene the Congress of Africa and Georgia is now saying the federal government is literally controlling the weather We're controlling the weather.

"Every Friday, Ryan Sexton, a member of my team, is at the Green Dragon Farmers Market with a voter registration table, meeting voters where they are, courting the vote, talking about the fact that Democrat Governor Josh Shapiro is waging a war on school choice and religious freedom and small businesses and raw milk and dairy and farmers."

Now we have a new poll from the New York Times with Sienna College this is an A plus rated pollster apparently the best the best even though their polls are all over the place that this election season but they show Kamala Harris with a four point lead when you don't round out the results over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania when you round these are the numbers that they give us it is 50% for Kamala Harris 47% for Donald Trump a three point lead when rounded when you unround Trump falls down to 46% which gives her a very impressive four point lead in Pennsylvania and you will look at why this four point lead is so important not to mention Arizona of course while we have this poll up Donald Trump really expanding his lead in Arizona to now a 6% margin very impressive for him but we you know we really have had this common consensus now for quite a while now for months now that Donald Trump will carry the state of Arizona as well as other Sun Belt states but Pennsylvania is the important one here Arizona only has 11 electoral votes Pennsylvania has 19 in such a close race like this that eight more from Pennsylvania sorry yeah eight more on that really does matter a lot so that four point lead is important because we always talk about you know how much are the polls overestimated Joe Biden in the 2020 election right because when you look at 2020 he was expected to win by only four point seven percent and I say only because take that with with a state like Wisconsin in 2020 where Joe Biden was expected to win in the polls on election day by eight point four percent he only won it by point six so he was overestimated basically eight percent almost in the state of Wisconsin while you head over to Pennsylvania again he was expected to win by four point seven he won it by one point two so he was only over estimated here by some three and a half percent so to see Kamala Harris with the four point lead on rounded in Pennsylvania that's big because I do want to preface this with saying that I don't think that Kamala Harris will be overestimated in the polls at all I currently think that she will be underestimated in the polling so even if she is overestimated as much as Joe Biden was in the 2020 election in Pennsylvania she still wins again Biden was overestimated by three and a half percent in Pennsylvania when you do the math Harris has a four point lead currently she would still win the state by a very narrow margin so Pennsylvania is hugely important right you know so that was just to show you know how important this single poll is considering that it isn't a plus pollster but now we have to talk about Pennsylvania because the fact that the fact the matter is she is running away with Pennsylvania it's a very narrow lead um in in of court like the average I'm in the aggregate of polls um which is expected and again I don't I do think that Harris will outpace what polls are expecting I really do because poll stars are pollsters are worried about underestimating the Trump factor once again and everything like that so they are really boosting Trump's are they're giving an emphasis on Trump areas because they're you know the polling industry is you know going down right now in the dumps um so again they're really trying to get it accurate this time not underestimate Trump ultimately I think that Harris is being underestimated now just like 2022 the Democrats were but when it comes to the average you can see Harris has never let up once in the state of Pennsylvania that's insane that is absolutely insane Harris has kept a lead in Pennsylvania this entire race now let's compare that to a state like North Carolina for a moment we see we see um in the beginning of the race Trump had a pretty steady lead then Harris took the lead for a moment there for literally like two days then he was even then Trump took the back the lead then it was even again Trump took the lead Harris took the lead by point to Trump took the lead Harris took the lead Trump took the lead again Harris took the lead Trump took the lead and he still has the lead less than 1% this is the case and this is the most extreme case but this is a case that's going that's happening with many many many battleground states Michigan not Michigan sorry Wisconsin Nevada especially Arizona Georgia for sure but what you notice is that it's not happening in Pennsylvania and that's important the fact that there is a common consensus in the polling numbers is important fact that common layers is a clear leader is a clear favorite to win in Pennsylvania that's important let's just take a look at at the 538 forecast here let's I don't know what they are currently projected to be honest um they say that the presidential race is extremely narrow but I assume they say of course that Harris is favored to win in Pennsylvania you can see there she has a 52 to 48 percent chance of winning the state but looking at Pennsylvania specifically again it is so incredibly important that Kamala Harris does have a lock on Pennsylvania that's what I've been saying for a while when you look at the electoral map Pennsylvania proves to be extremely important this is my forecast that's the map these are all the numbers this is how I think that the election will go if it were held today or tomorrow or whatever so Pennsylvania is critical obviously to Kamala Harris on now if Trump does win Pennsylvania Kamala Harris actually still wins the election however she then has literally zero wiggle room the only place that she could lose is Nebraska second district resulting in her still winning the election even if she loses just Nevada on top of that you know just two slight changes in my forecast then she loses the election 267 to 271 however however North Carolina is basically toss-up I have a Harris plus 0.1 percent because I don't know it's too hard to tell there are too many factors Mark Robinson being on the ballot the state shifting left rapidly right now there are so many factors to consider North Carolina it's virtually toss-up I think that Harris wins by honestly a few thousand votes so look I would not be surprised in the slightest if Trump wins North Carolina because the odds really are 50-50 in my forecast right now considering that margin of Harris plus 0.1 so if North Carolina does go red which you say I'm on a chance that it goes red as it goes blue then she can't lose Pennsylvania then she has to hold Pennsylvania so the fact that she as I outlined she is you know she has this sort of lock on Pennsylvania right now as she has had throughout this race that's important because it is critical to her path to victory then if she holds Pennsylvania she could even lose Nevada Nevada could even go to Donald Trump and it could still result in a 270 win for Harrison walls 270 is the minimum you need to win the presidency that is just two electoral votes up against Trump and Vance so North Carolina and Nevada could easily go Republican but as long as she has Pennsylvania she wins the election and she holds the other blue wall states now what if Trump wins Pennsylvania it's you know obviously it's important to Harris's victory but if Trump is going to win the election of course I really think that you know he might need Pennsylvania however that he doesn't need it he could he could simply just run the Sun Belt North Carolina Georgia Arizona Nevada and then flip Wisconsin I think that Wisconsin will be closer than Pennsylvania so that of course can absolutely happen but if Pennsylvania does go red it really opens the door for Donald Trump if he wins the Sun Belt plus Pennsylvania he's at 287 17 more than he needs then he could even lose North Carolina and he still wins the election or he could actually lose he could even lose Nevada and Arizona and he still wins the election 270 to 268 so you know Pennsylvania everything weighs on Pennsylvania almost Donald Trump and Kamala Harris still paths to victory especially Trump Trump still has a path to victory without Pennsylvania however Pennsylvania is one of the most likely states to go to either candidate because of how split it is right now so it's very good for Kamala Harris when she gets polls like this which shows her from an A plus pollster with a pretty steady lead in the most critical battleground state Pennsylvania and again I think that she will win it Joe Biden won it by 1.2% in 2020 and what we have seen is a massive left-word trend in the suburbs the suburbs that dominate Pennsylvania elections and we are seeing massive left-ward trends across suburbs or in suburbs across the nation so if Pennsylvania can continue to trend to the left then the Democrats are in for a really good result in Pennsylvania so look at this Chester County Pennsylvania vote for Mitt Romney in 2012 by 0.2% he lost the state Obama won the state by 5% fast forward four years later Chester County went from 0.2 for Romney to 10 for Hillary Clinton now Donald Trump won the state so while the state as a whole trended seven points or six points I should say towards the Republicans Chester County became ten points more Democratic that you never see furthermore he went from ten points in 2016 to a stunning 17 points for Biden in 2020 suburbs eight Donald Trump and I believe that now more than ever with someone like Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket for the Democrats she will be able to really continue this trend possibly you know trend it more these at least Chester County trend it more towards the Democrats than we have seen in past elections in 2016 and 2020 so that's the state of the race right now in Pennsylvania hugely important state Kamala Harris definitely favored to win so thank you all

"But this time around, it doesn't look like that if the polls are to be believed."
"Why would you come here to not only show support, but also to sell merch to the people?"
"This is Michigan in 2020, Biden less than three points."
"Republicans, as we get closer to Election Day, they're actually requesting even more ballots."
God first Trump after.
"I expect that to continue in 2024, as far as accuracy."
So in Wisconsin 52% say Trump better on immigration 45% say Harris preserving democracy in the United States.
Right now there's a lot of young people in Philadelphia and elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that are feeling that pressure.
"That is, I mean, she, she, she, well, she didn't make it to Iowa and then she won zero votes in 2024."
As far as the other candidate in the past he has done real good stuff.
Now just because you are registered as a Republican means nothing.
So I will see you all later.
People don't really feel that way.
How can you spin this?
"I'm happy because I think it's working out in our favor And I think Kamala is you know, she's not the most intelligent person."
"Oh, sorry."
"So according to 538's latest polling average, Casey is up by about five points over McCormick, but over the last two months, that has shrunk from about a nine point lead back in August."
"These are all effective things that really went a large way to making, you know, give Walz a national platform to say, hey, look at what Democrats in Minnesota have been able to do."
"When you believe in what we need to do to lift up the middle class, you fight for the middle class."
I'm all for one.
Political fans.
"Oh, so it looks very local too."
We just say people are excited today.
"Um, and it was like updated in real time."
Who comes down to golden escalator?
"Pennsylvania, with its crucial 20 electoral votes, has been a political battleground that can make or break a presidential campaign."
"This particular case was used by Shapiro to draw attention to a more general problem, which is the disparity between collecting endorsements from an organization and engaging with individual members in a genuine manner."
"I mean, no, this has been admitted now by a dude who donated $400 million to their campaign."
But it turned out to be a hefty house cat.
We don't know if it's Putin.
"In Pennsylvania, as you know, Rachel, a lot is on the line in November."
"But either way, there's four other polls that dropped that found Trump either slightly ahead or in a statistical tie with Harris."
"So as you say, it's just as close as it gets."
"Bobby Eberle, Chip Franklin, thank you both so much for joining."
"The consensus was Harris plus point five by some miracle, even in that scenario, back in 2020, at the same time, back in 2020, August or I should say early September of 2020, it was Biden plus four."
"I'm 39 years old, but it's always been a taboo topic."
It's the same argument I used a few weeks ago when this whole thing came up.
He's a genius at business.
Some of these House races you name it and they were able to kind of make Mike Braun underperform and make Donald Trump underperform as well.
She spoke directly to the people.
Apologies.
"I just don't understand why so many people fail to understand that white working class voters are probably going to resonate with somebody like Joe Biden who can play that moderate card, who people in Pennsylvania knew for decades and decades."
But what do you think?
"But Quinnipiac, they're known for push polls."
So yes.
We got jd vans What do you think of jd?
And it certainly is.
"He seems like a dude who's just obsessed with politics and voted for Trump, but then didn't and then wanted Haley."
"So in terms of margin, this is probably the largest margin we've actually seen in favor of Kamala Harris in a while."
"Today with the stock market hitting a new record high, the Harris campaign highlighted a survey of economists in the Wall Street Journal who agreed that Donald Trump's policies would drive up prices, interest rates, and the national debt while hurting manufacturing jobs."
"If someone says, look, I like Governor Josh Shapiro."
Real strength is about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can't always stand up for themselves.
"Cooper's interest in urban development and affordable housing drives his support for Harris, who has outlined plans to address the housing crisis in America."
"This reporter and several other CBS colleagues were at these events that drew five figures, more than 12,000 in Philadelphia, roughly 12,000 in Wisconsin, the event I was at last week."
So you're kind of seeing the way that these polls go.
These are the only points that can be won.
That's a Trump.
"At the helm, lifelong Republican Al Schmidt stood up to former President Trump and refused to join attempts to overturn his loss four years ago."
"You know, I've had a number of private conversations throughout this process with the governor."
And that's true.
Clinton plus nine.
"Akayla, thank you again."
All of them.
 You saw the polls over the weekend.
"I mean, he's starting to lead all these states and these are, these are really good polling numbers for Trump in states like Pennsylvania where the margin is going to be very slim, but if you get a plus three, a plus four, you will have the overall edge in terms of the aggregate."
A demographic that could be pivotal in November.
"Also, the latest poll results are showing the same."
"However, in 2016, Pennsylvania flipped red, with Trump securing a narrow victory of less than one percent, making it one of the key states that handed him the White House.IN 2020, Pennsylvania flipped back to the Democrats, with Joe Biden winning the state by just over one percent."
"I'm also announcing that as part of our additional tax cuts, we will end all taxes on overtime."
All that I ask is that you understand that I'm a human being.
Pennsylvania has more than 20 percent of the natural oil and gas that is extracted through fracking.
And we are indeed going to make America great again.
"I come from Steel Valley, Monohone State area of Pittsburgh."
That's what I make.
"Gun control environment, but I'd also include women's rights."
"These states are crucial to the path to victory for any presidential candidate, and Trump's favorable position in these polls could significantly enhance his chances of winning the presidency."

God bless you.
He's going to drop out.
Do you?
"You're not going to anger and see supercharged turnout based on that issue alone, or you're not going to bleed a lot of independence on that issue alone as things stand today."
It was called a blue mirage.
It was there.
He will use the IRS to go after people.
"And you have this administration that pretends like the economy is all fine, everything is going well, not really the best look."
Do you owe back taxes?

"All right, Lieutenant Governor Austin Davis, thank you so much."
"Now, the city of Philadelphia has become slightly more Republican."
"In recent elections, turnout in Philadelphia and its suburbs has been crucial to democratic success."
They're not really behind Donald Trump.
What it is is these people are tired of the Democratic Party and they're bullshit.
It was an amazing event.
"She's bringing in a lot of this big money, the backing of the billionaires."
"These three states have often shifted between Democratic and Republican control, making them incredibly valuable to both parties."

"All right, Jake, so in recent hours, Trump's been dealing with more questions, more talk and discussion over his cognitive health, comes as his campaign is really ramping up efforts to appeal to younger male voters."
"And Senator Bob Casey, of course, the incumbent there, he's won every single one of his races since 2006 by at least nine points."
"Well, see, it's weird."
And those are the top stories making the headlines in the North American region.
And so J.D.
God bless all of you.
"If Trump's campaign can demonstrate success in Pennsylvania, it might encourage legal actions or legislative efforts in other battleground states to adopt or enforce similar measures."
"I guess it's possible that maybe she wins every other state except Pennsylvania, but I don't see that occurring."
And this poll sheds light on the complexities of this key voting bloc.
It' family.
What I see right here is a rich white liberal.
That's the avalanche begins.
So do you really believe that Joe Biden was not able to win these people back?
"Both candidates are investing heavily in campaign advertisements, trying to sway voters through various media channels."
"Obviously, it's an heirloom quality product, and it could be yours for the low, low price of $59.99."
"Most importantly, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person, the rally who was unalive and also to the family of another person who was badly injured."
"Joe Biden only won Wisconsin by less than a point, won Michigan by less than three points, and won Pennsylvania by a point."
"It's not invertible since it's not, you know, it's not injected."
"And if they're not even 60% of the early vote, they are in deep trouble."
It would be a huge pickup for Republicans because of the incumbency with the Democrats.
I'm very excited.
What is that betrayal?
South Korea.
"I think it's certainly possible for Quinnipiac in this poll to not be accurately representing Trump's stage of support in Pennsylvania, while at the same time acknowledging the fact that Harrison may have a slight lead in the state."
What you couldn't tell is that Taylor is dead.
"But again, if Pennsylvania stays blue for Harris with 19 electoral votes, she has other options."
I think it showed DeSantis up about 7 percent among Hispanic voters and also 50 percent of them saying that they liked his policy of shipping migrants to Martha's Vineyards.
He's doing great in early voting.
"Let's not forget that Pennsylvania is part of the so-called Blue Wall, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin."
So I don't really question Quinnipiac support for Harris in this.
Things are going well.
"Philadelphia city council member, Kendra Brooks, a member of the working, it's because they're Democrats, we're using their terms."
So he is a surrogate just like all the other big surrogates that are being deployed in this final month.
"I got to say, I was wondering when she was going to go to Luzerne County."
Our love is not a victory March.
They dropped a poll with Trump leading by three percentage points.
It's for a lot of different people across the country.
I don't need protection.
So these kinds of polls look really good.
"But by the way, first, I want to talk to you about why Harris is there."
We've seen polls out of the Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News over the past month or so that also show Donald Trump is in the lead in Michigan.
50% is exactly where you want to be if you're not beyond 50% when you're looking at a lead in any type of poll.
"So they went to the Secret Service, they found out it was all bullshit."
Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party's strategy.
This is how it goes now.
That's at least a five point swing.
I don't want to hear lies.
And then that flipped in 2016 when former President Trump won the state and won the White House.
"So, so instead, so now he's sabotaging himself."
Normally they're the ones that are lock step and the Republicans are often la la land.
So you just going to go do it.
"So the question about the whole polling thing and the tightness is if 2020 is the benchmark for what they're polling against, I don't know."
They've weaponized our elections.
"Yeah, some bullshit Terrible Everything need to go down."
"If Biden did that, could you imagine how much Kamala Harris is going to actually overperform the numbers?"
"There's still an inside straight she could get, but largely if Trump takes Pennsylvania, he's got this."
He's just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues.
"Maybe there's a God above, but all I ever learned from love was how to shoot somebody who out drew."
Explain that to me.
"I mean, that doesn't seem like a good reason to me, but."
"Trump would be the oldest president ever, and after Biden dropped out because of age, it's a hot topic."

"The Trump campaign told Spectrum News it has paid staffers and volunteer-powered field programs in every battleground state, including Pennsylvania, and they are expanding daily."

"To catch up, per my practice I'll take a look at a series of polling shifts to try and ascertain momentum in the current race for Pennsylvania."
"And when you take a stand, as I have and as Kamala has, to take on what I call greed, inflation, going after price gouging, decidedly in favor of a middle class tax cut, helping folks pay for child care, helping folks make ends meet, when you take on those fights, which are, I think, at the core of what people are concerned about, you're going to piss off a lot of billionaires."

"You know, they were going up against Trump's endorsement and there was no Democrat primary that was open on the governor's side."

I'm here today to speak loud.
And then you've also got this going on at the same time on the same day.
I got you.
So I'm not even going to speculate.
Wouldn't you want to do that?
And feel reminiscent of what we saw with Obama back in 2012 with an expanded Democratic coalition.
"The speaker highlighted the importance of unity among Puerto Ricans, expressing support for Trump's agenda, which seeks to empower the community and foster growth."
And a lot of times things change.
We'll see.
"Indian Americans, though, have also in polling shown to be very concerned about the war in Gaza and are very critical of of the Biden administration and Israel and the conduct of the war in Gaza."
But that's not what it means.
"I mean, those two, those two obviously very liberal cities are Democrat run seat, but in between there and everywhere else in the state of Pennsylvania really is a very conservative state after all."
People are ready to win and are ready to help deliver this ticket.
Can Harris secure Pennsylvania and push herself past the finish line in this nail-biting election?
"Yeah, gender gap."
He's going to get attacked for it from both the left and the right.
They had clicked it up by nine points and granted it was in the middle of July.

"Students here at Arizona, you could try it with your professors."

"So last time around, he only got through a few minutes of his speech."
Plus 52% were female.
Vance was here.
They take in the geese.
"Russia's entire strategy is to start a war, pause that war when it serves their interests, and reignite it down the road."
I will.
Where do I start?
How much to align with Biden versus how much to differentiate herself from him?
"The feisty and lovable character wasn't originally written as Filipino, but this changed when Morelos booked a role."
"Like you probably be out there with Joe Biden over Hebra beach and Delaware, which is right there."
He's focused like a laser beam on cutting costs for folks.

"It's really hard to discern what the truth is unless you're here, so I just am hoping that people take a pause and, you know, dial down the vitriol."

I've got to ask you quickly about some changes Three charges against Trump dropped yesterday.
"And again, Kamala Harris had a nice little surge in the betting odds today."

Chester might move left a little bit.
Okay so because there are so like 43% of all the votes cast in this entire state are coming from this section and this section that means there are a lot of voters in those areas which means it takes much longer to actually count those votes so it's always late into the evening Allegheny will come in first in Pennsylvania and all of the sudden the numbers in the blue column start shooting up and then when the numbers over in this area come in the numbers will continue to go up.

"He's just slandering at this point, which I don't like that and I really wish that it would be more about what is, what are your plans as a president versus what are you just want to trash talk the next person because we can always say something bad about somebody."
It's what?
But right now and the voter registration numbers are coming down.

"But this is a trend that we see with former President Trump, where he has these long-winded remarks where he goes off script and then says something that doesn't really sit right and then somebody has to clean it up the next day."
He represents your values Is there anything that he speaks to in particular that really excites you as a voter?

But I hear you.
"But again, there's also a lot of rural voters in Wisconsin."

People make excuses for it.
And Trump says maggot Hagerman of the failing New York Times falsely reported that I was disappointed with the crowds.
"Because this election, it's not just about picking a president."
The literal brain rot in real life and online makes me want to fucking off myself because I know all this shit is just going to propel him into office and I told you I don't give a fuck about who you vote for.

How was your meeting with Vice President Harris?
AOC came out and warned us and ends up she actually was right.
"They resort to warfare The secret service allowed it to happen There are thousands of eyewitnesses and countless recordings of what happened If he doesn't turn his head to the right, he's not here right now Other people weren't as lucky ebb stein was a major democrat party donor Financier and socialite everyone knew him."
"And in a lot of ways, it felt like the aspirations of working people have taken a backseat to the priorities of the rich and the powerful and the well-connected."

And I think Pennsylvania is aware of it based on polling that we're getting.
"And then she's just going to be like, I grew up in a middle class family."
"The boy's father has also spoken out, really asking Trump to stop."
The campaign still has real work to do according to Pastor Charles Williams the second.

"Former President Trump went after Al Schmidt by name on Twitter, and violent threats from Trump supporters followed."
"The Trump camouflage oven mitt, the Trump football flask, the Trump pool float, not intended for use as a flotation device, and the Trump needlepoint flag belt."

 Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged.
Now the former president has a number of stops in Pennsylvania over the weekend.
Kamala Harris has to go it alone with her campaign ads but it's not really a down ballot effort.
Don't forget to vote.

"The huge, huge inflation that we've experienced where wages have not kept up."
 Donald Trump is in a strong position to win the key swing state of Pennsylvania.
She lost it by roughly one point.

There's no changing their minds.
I know I'm everything Everything I'm that guy DJ quick for president.
Good to see you.
It's just I don't trust her.

"And while most Trump supporters, I would say, I talk to, talk about his characteristics, a significant group at every single rally I attend raised conspiracy theories with me, the woman who thought Joe Biden was dead, another woman in New Hampshire who told me she was sure that Mother Teresa was a man, and by the way, the father of Anthony Fauci."
And we're Donald Trump can't hold a candle to what we are doing every day because he is just full of empty promises that have quite literally raised costs for the middle class and made it harder for them to get ahead.
"And so when you entice him that way to talk about himself, instead of talking about the American people and how he's going to help them, it's something that we've come to know is just part of his problem."
Maybe he did.
Here's the thing I gotta understand it honestly doesn't matter if it was staged or not because all that matters is how it appears and how it appears is that someone tried to pew pew at him directly and only grazed him.
Both campaigns are concentrating on key swing stages which have historically played a significant role in election outcomes.
"Which again, Biden did several points better in Allegheny, even Erie County in a place like Butler, Westmoreland, etc."
"So I just, I'm, I just, I can't fathom it right now."
"I think in terms of the policy and kind of where the country is going right now, you know, I'll favor him."
Wisconsin accounts for 10.
This is not a complicated issue.
"Thank you so much for watching The Real News Network, where we lift up the voices, stories and struggles that you care about most."
"We didn't think that would go away, and we got lazy about it sometimes."
That's what strength looks like.
She sent it to some of the state party leaders and it's pretty scathing.
There were new polls that dropped out of the state of Michigan and he's leading in every single swing state.
He's up by two and that's very telling because that poll was actually accurate in the midterms.
"In contrast, real clear politics shows them tied, and individual polls reflect the close nature of the race."
Donald Trump narrowly won it.
"Why is it so impo people to vote, especiall of this election?"
"Well, one of the big issues the article points to is the campaign's leadership in Pennsylvania."
Put down your vote and do what?
"The bipartisan deal that Kamala Harris supported, even though it was written by one of the most conservative Republicans in Congress, and Donald Trump deliberately lobbied against it and told Republicans don't vote for it because he figured that if you passed it, he would not be able to engage in the same kind of fear-mongering that he's been doing."
And this one is notable because it's an all-female audience.
"Yes, and I've again worked on that My values have not changed."
"And on top of that, you can buy one, get one 20% off all t-shirts, tank tops and mugs."
Early voting.
"But President Trump conducting diplomacy with our enemies, I think, was very important for our country to maintain our status as the world's number one superpower."
Finished?
"Hell, he doesn't even need Georgia at that point."
I'm 90-10 on the debate.
"Is it just about canvassing, knocking on people's doors and saying, hey, are you registered to vote?"
"Is this just ancestral Democrats in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, Green County, Washington County?"
So let's talk about the economy.
I'm guessing he hasn't did anything.
We know that people are struggling to put food on the table for their families.
You have to defend the main six.
They're trying to essentially take each other down.
I'm kidding.
"Quite frankly, when people are putting out plus and minus three margin of error polls, there is going to be some polling error."
We'll start with you Bridget.
"I mean, like having served in Afghanistan for 16 months, you know, as essentially an ambassador for this country on the ground as an infantry officer, you meet with your enemies to try to broker peace deals."
We had one of the deadliest hurricanes in American history.
"I mean, if you look at the pieces of the Build Back Better bill that passed the House in 2021 and were stripped out in the Senate by Manchin and Sinema, that's pretty much a presidential agenda, child tax credit, increased childcare help, health subsidies, more prescription drug support, you know, gun control."
Just all there is to it.
"Anyone who doesn't have a big race of their own and is a boldface name of the following, whether it is Bernie Sanders, whether it's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, they're all hitting the campaign trail right now on behalf of Kamala Harris."
"The court's ruling in Pennsylvania thus represents a pivotal moment in this ongoing debate, as it underscores the Republican's commitment to reinforcing election security."
"And I'm like, no, this is never gonna be a five point race."
"This was provoked by the rhetoric, AOC, Biden, Schiff, Pelosi, Christopher Wray, all of them."
"And then, you know, you'll end on something obvious, like The Lord of the Rings."
"The content above showcases the latest briefing reports and analytical synopses, thoughtfully curated by the 6Do team."
"Crucial role, especially in Pennsylvania."
But how confident are you that Vice President Harris and Tim Waltz can win Pennsylvania in November?
"Hey man, did you see this?"
You'll see both candidates in split screen and you'll see what those comparisons are.
Did God protect any of them?
We're going to ask why he was his.
"The group claims to have about 700,000 people who support it."
"And Jeremy Stahl points out, most importantly, Federman beat New Jersey based crudite loving TV celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz."
Blood streaming down his face.
And her views have always aligned with environmental and climate change-concerned advocates who say that the use of fossil fuels is a danger to the Earth and our very existence.
"The point is, I was just picturing it, The point is, if you elect Kamala and Tim, they will not be focused on their problems, they will be focused on yours."
Everything's cordoned off.
He needs a rust belt state.
And so making life affordable again is something that I'm hearing a lot from our politicians.
"Look, the other thing that's really key in our commonwealth is not just winning the votes of people of your own party, but winning independents and winning people who are like-minded in the other party."
"So that shows you where we are as a country right now, where 60 to 70% of people don't aren't doing well."
And he wasn't a problem.
"Kamala Harris is winning Wisconsin and Michigan, but by less than one point."
"And of course, there were comments by the former president about hurricane relief."
What is clear is that Pennsylvania will continue to play a crucial role in determining the ultimate winner of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
You really care about me even though.
Even though that sounds just absolutely crazy to suggest.
"So I'm gonna talk about 10 most important points, but before that subscribe to channel and hit the like button and so it encourages me to make more and more videos for you guys."
And those arrows still live in my brain.
You don't miss a beat.
There's no question.
"So, you know, reading the tea leaves there, who else would be in Philadelphia with her except Shapiro?"
"Now, Pennsylvania has always been a pretty close state."
It'll be the first election certification since the U.S. Capitol attack of 2021.
Biden and the Democratic Party doesn't get that.
"But four years ago, Biden won by one point two."
"Because Hannibal Lecter was a serious psycho, right?"
I cannot comprehend that.
But I don't have a lot of experience other than working in the state capital with toxic masculinity.
I'd help them so they can make the steel company good again.
We have brand new sound from the Vice President in an interview that she did earlier today with Stephanie Rule at MSNBC.
"Now, before I get going, you guys have to forgive me, because let's face it, I'm a little out of practice."
And so that's what happened.
They liked his response to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.
"In other words, talking about immigration, sure, which a lot of people say is a problem, but also saying that he's going to use the powers of the federal government to go after his political enemies."
I think she's doing what she needs to do.
So Casey should feel a little more confident here.
"I wonder if there might be some motivation to change that law, Senator, when Donald Trump claims victory at nine thirty at night on election day, are you worried about reliving this again?"
"Now, I don't know what Mr. McCormick was talking about because senators don't sign legislation."
"So, Alyssa, can Trump win launching these kinds of very, very personal attacks against Kamala Harris?"
And I think it's an almost impossible position to be in.
"And I said, Ian, let me ask you something."
"But absolutely explains why people, you know, choosing someone like Tim Walz was a good choice, why Kamala Harris being the replacement nominee for it was a good choice."
They like to sprinkles.
There's a Trump Trump.
"I'm sorry, I can't do that."
"They said, no, 48 years."
I don't exactly understand these people's logic when it comes down to these primaries like we explained Pennsylvania very well.
"Every single one of these states, when we pull in these states to try to see who's winning, the answer is within what's called the margin of error."
Kamala surrounds herself with yes men and people who are sort of in the in the no apparatus.
"And yeah, you know, only five points here, two and a half points here, five here, five here."
"It's not like it's, you know, Nevada that's worth only six electoral votes where, yeah, Trump could win it, but even then it would not be enough to win the presidency."
"We don't have any places like this where we are from and recently the thing I've heard the most is I used to purchase bulk beef from a farmer nearby, friend, relative, but they don't have cattle anymore."
I come from a family of multi-generation of steelworkers.
Who knows what they're going to say at the end of the day.
So my mother worked at a college up in Prescott.
"Yeah, well, I think I would point out, you were asking me earlier, what all is happening in Georgia."
"Okay, let's just keep watching this."
They feel like that was the key part of his success here in the Keystone State in 2016 and it's something they want to be able to replicate this time.
"One, I think that both both of the Harris campaigns and the Trump campaigns."
And even then the numbers with early voting in Pennsylvania are absolutely atrocious for Democrats.
He said to get less than 70%.
"It was also friends and coworkers and neighbors and even political opponents, people on the other side of the aisle."
phones for Harris and Wallace because originally we weren't going to do anything when Biden was going to be this presidential candidate.
"And look, I actually want to admit that I was wrong about something."
Maybe that's why they're off by so much that doesn't explain a Biden plus seven just two weeks before Election Day.
"Kamala Harris talking about cutting childcare costs, right?"
There's no denying that there's a new momentum.
"He's going, they tried to shoot me."
"And I think that, again, that's what worries people like me who's been involved in fighting disinformation for so long."
This was two weeks and they were off by six.
I haven't asked a question yet.
"It's in line with Atlas Intel, one of the most accurate pollsters in 2020."
When you're here at the county fair and you've got to stand and you're doing it one to three voters at a time.
"If the trajectory of the race though remains roughly stable, I would expect Trump to win Pennsylvania."
I think that would be sort of the break-even point.
"What if Jill Stein was the spoiler that gave this election to Donald Trump because of I mean, 2% in Michigan, that's pretty good."
He's a Trump voter.
You're the one who thinks like that.
He needs to do more of that.
It makes for a pretty unpredictable electorate.
But we're going to get to that.
"As the election approaches, expect Pennsylvania to be a major focus of both campaigns, with each side vying for the support of the state's swing voters."
Do you think rhetoric is a problem in the country?
"Osman, let's bring you in now."
We can't do it without civilians and civilians can't do it without military.
We've seen massive polling errors in Wisconsin.
"So if Donald Trump were to win Pennsylvania, he really wouldn't need much more, just 16 electoral votes."
"Pennsylvania's electoral votes have been the deciding factor in multiple elections, and that's especially true now, with 19 crucial votes up for grabs."
"That's why whenever that I don't know if it did just release, I figure I would have seen it on my timeline."
"If they like what they hear, they'll offer you a deal."
WIC may or may not be like somewhat right leaning.
"On the other hand, the first thing out of David McCormick's mouth is, there's nothing we could work on because I don't agree with him on anything."
No uncomfortable doctor visits.
"And, and listen, this isn't like three or four years ago."
"I mean, this Marist poll, it's 49-49 Trump and Harris."
It's things like crime.
And so she went out.
And let's remember who we are.
"I would be honored, Madam Vice President."
This is the guy who almost committed what should be an impossible crime to commit.
"But if not, we're ready to go."
"All that, peace."
The race did narrow here in the middle of September and again at the end of October.
"And last question, John, is give me your nickel tour of the of what you see."
"Like you could tell that when he says he's sorry, it's from his heart."
"I don't think so, right?"
"In Maryland, there were a lot of people like me and I wasn't afraid to say it."
Okay so this is the state of Pennsylvania and these are all of their counties and congressional districts so what you see with all of these little kind of jaggedy lines and everything these are the boundaries around each of the counties so here's here here here here here here here here and so forth.
UConn's men and women's teams are both in the Final Four.
"So that's something that is of concern to the automotive industry here in Michigan, which of course is the economic driver of prosperity here in Michigan with thousands and thousands of jobs."
It's not so bad.
And President Biden and Vice President Harris were down in North Carolina meeting with local officials and comforting families.
She has plenty of resources to be able to communicate her message.
"Yeah, and Vlad, election experts are telling us that this is absolutely not legal, that this is illegal."
 This area we stand on was over three years ago was nothing but a forest.
She's letting all these people from other countries come over here.
Lt. Gov.
It's one of the reasons I'm here to support him and let everyone know we won't be intimidated.
"And I'm sorry, but I just feel like all of this is so manufactured."
Thank you so much for listening.
And so I personally am definitely very afraid of like the Trump overperformance because he always overperforms by two or three.
I was in Butler on the day of the assassination attempt.
So it's nothing crazy anyways.
"You've got American liberal governors signing artillery shells, shipping them to Ukraine and launching them into Russian territory."
You heard some of his opponents during the last few months say the wall wasn't finished.
That's where President Biden is from in Scranton.
I'm feeling good with her.
This is what we're up against.
"I keep telling my friends, once the money gets allocated by the Congress, it goes to the executive branch."
"So that's like a you know, I mean like a 7.3 You know percent polling errors almost twice just for reference His lead was double in Wisconsin versus what it was in Pennsylvania But the amount he won by was basically double in the reverse order."
Don't try to sanitize it and color it up for them.
If the leaked internal polling from the Harris campaign shows that she's losing meaningfully in states like Michigan.
"George, good morning."
He would call it a state often.
"Again, shaded red."
It's not going to win talking about whether she's dumb.
"And there are also high-paying jobs, too."
And Secretary of State have a say in how elections are run in their state.
"And so now we are seeing differences in the way people receive the race, the political betting markets are starting to change this morning, we saw that they shifted up 52 to 46 yesterday, if you saw my video, I made a video covering how the fact that they flip for the first time this election season 49 to 47."
"So he's very clear that he's obviously going to try to steal the election again, just like he did last time."
It's not even agreeing on what's happening.
We appreciate you being on.
"Before we get into those states though, please take a second to consider subscribing to my channel below."
"Listen, I don't understand how people feel."

"Thanks, Christian."
You can vote from October 15th to November 1st.
"When you're campaigning out there, people want to see someone who reflects their values, someone who they can relate to."

"You got to get high turnout, but, you know, Democrats have their low propensity voters that they really maxed out their turnout in 2020 and probably are going to see a little bit of a dip, whereas Republicans left a little bit more on the table."
"As Peter Henline, DeSantis supporter, who is still a big supporter of democracy and logic and common sense."
Whether it's the economy.

"And no point in time did Donald Trump really ever see a position where he was dropping so rapidly in election odds, dropping so rapidly in terms of overall performance, in terms of expectation, in terms of fundraising."
15.
Probably.

We'll do it tomorrow.
"Nancy Cook and Sabrina Rodriguez, that's not your problem."

"For me, character is a major issue."
I've decided.
"So certainly trying to keep his distance on some issues, but at the same time, very much running with Trump here."
" Speaking of Donald Trump, take a look at this moment from yesterday at a grocery store in Pennsylvania."
"Very deeply disappointing and offensive to everyone who knows better and every woman, I feel like in the country, regardless of what they voted for in the last election."
That's the way we should do it.
And it's a key state for Biden to hold onto.
"I don't care what people say insider advantage is a good pollster, especially in 2020."
This is just disgusting rhetoric about our ally.
"My husband is, Doug, you are doing so much and you've been traveling all over our country and I want to thank you."
Let's talk about fracking because we're here in Pennsylvania.
It could be could be completely wrong.
There's been inflation scars.
That's always in the description.
I don't think it'll be like 2020.
"You've seen Republicans in Minnesota go after Democrats for how the, you know, everything that after George Floyd's murder was handled, the rioting and the response, but also attitudes towards police and law enforcement."
So it's working very well.
"And it's interesting, Akayla, in our NBC News poll, voters were asked, what is the one issue you feel so strongly about that you will vote for or against a candidate solely on that issue?"
" Let's bring in Harris campaign spokesperson now, Ian Sams."
"And it looks like again, a 50-50 some game."
"They've had a couple of good weeks, but how do they continue to maintain this energy, particularly in a state like Pennsylvania, where your governor, Josh Shapiro, was passed over as the running mate."
We have to get the resources to the border to get the job done.
Let's stick to this.
And that's the challenge I have with the infrastructure that Kamala Harris inherited from the Biden team.
"Daniel like another swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, Indian Americans have really been growing in numbers now."
But we have not seen it in a presidential election year.
So here's the headline Quinnipiac poll September 18th.
Now watch any of these videos to know the latest poll results of another state.
Because we shouldn't ban fracking.
"I think there are real questions with how he is spending money in this race, how the dark money is flowing, not just into Pennsylvania, but apparently now into the pockets of Pennsylvanians."
"Well, here, Donald Trump says that if President Biden wins the election, that one of the things that's going to happen is that the name of Pennsylvania will be changed."
"Says it's a Swiss watch, but nobody can actually figure out where in Switzerland was this thing made."
"Even even plus one plus one, and you know, there's evens 49s."

"In 2020, for example, high turnout in these areas helped Biden secure his victory in the state."
Make sure you guys like this video down below and subscribe to the channel if you are new.
What's happening right now on this earth is extremely spiritual.
"We know which side they're on, but there's this kind of reputation that a Rasmussen is going to wildly overestimate Donald Trump in the swing states."
If Harris wins Pennsylvania more than likely she wins the presidency.
"So at this point what she is looking to do is get that crossover appeal to some Republicans or some moderate, some people who may be on the fence, some moderate Republicans, folks that may be on the fence, about what is it that could potentially give them an appeal to Kamala Harris, what could potentially get them over to her side."
It's not like he hasn't been spending any of his war chest either.
Walk us through why Pennsylvania matters so much.
"It's all there publicly, but Donald Trump's gonna, Donald Trump, meaning he's just gonna go out there and lie."
It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it.
It's the reason why he got 75 million votes back in 2020 and why he retains such a strong hold on voters today.
And I was just really inspired.
And they found the same thing.
Ninety-four ballots in one tray.
So you think you think that Trump can win with all the cheating that goes on?
Whichever candidate wins North Hampton and Erie counties will likely win the president.
But at the peak for Harris was being tied in the average and Trump has a history of outperforming the polling by several points and the raw data suggests that the Democrats surge.
"Advocates say that it could prevent the US citizenship pronunciation, which occurs partly due to this complex tax regulation."

We shouldn't let anybody walk through into our country.
"And then he says he's pro life strong on crime, the border election F word."
"I still think that there is a pathway for Harris, but in the last couple of days, it seems like there has been more data to suggest, uh, yeah, Trump's probably gonna win Pennsylvania."
"He's talking about, oh, she's so attractive."
He called for recognition of his efforts to maintain peace during his administration.
"And one of those, actually both of them were very flawed in terms of methodology, but even then those were from months ago."
Michigan is poised to play a decisive role in the 2024 presidential election.
It's so nuts.
"And Senator, right now in the past 48 hours, we've got about 29 million people who are watching the Midas Touch Network."
"In 2023, feeder cap prices reached an all-time high, coupled with the increase in other commodities and prices to farmers not keeping up."

I've had residents come when we first pushed the first ceasefire resolution for what's unfolding across Gaza to speak to the calamity that has struck their family.
"The state has experienced significant economic transitions, notably the decline of traditional manufacturing jobs and the subsequent rise of service-oriented sectors."
This is Donald Trump's hood right here.
"Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley won more than 16 percent of the vote in the Republican contest, even though she's, of course, no longer in the race."
I had no idea that that was the next thing in there.
This is near Cardi's summer home on Maryland's Eastern shore.

"He held a town hall meeting where he just, let me explain, because I've done a lot of town hall meetings."

"All right, so we got, we're gonna keep going down."
"She's trying to convince voters in areas where Donald Trump's pretty popular to vote for her, at least cut into his margins."
I wonder how all of you are thinking about this upcoming election and the various issues and what they mean for your families and how it will shape the way you think about your choice in 2024.
I know someone who thinks getting to order takeout equals middle class.
We just got to see what happens.
We all know what happened with that.
The links on the community tab.
There's a lot of people coming forth with their opinions and a lot of facts and details and stuff that we just didn't know at the time.
What a crowd.
"And of course, join the channel today."
I don't care what they say.
There's too many moving parts.
"I mean, the head pollster there is a Trump supporter wants Donald Trump to win."
Something was wrong here.
Every day for years and years and years studying public opinion and looking at how elections turn out based off of that public opinion.
"There's, however, one metric that even some Democrats are finally starting to admit that they have a problem with."
What's the mood there and what have you heard?
I don't think there's a lot of substance there.
Let's say you're a pro sports team.
This crowd is 90% gone from the seating area.
I would say Biden.
That's not a good combination whatsoever.
"And of course, like you said, he has focused a lot of time also talking about how he would conduct mass deportations and how he wants to secure the border with."
He'd have a sizable lead in Pennsylvania.
"Clearly, her campaign is trying to shake stuff up because, you know, I mean, this has been a crazy couple months and an unprecedented couple months in terms of American politics."
Harris finished 4 points ahead of Trump in this poll.
Let's see how they play out.
"The perception among voters, among a slight majority of voters that were Donald Trump to win, he would leave abortion up to the states."
"Over to the southeast we go, starting in Georgia."
"They found the race tied, which I find it very strange that literally every pollster except like two or three of them, they found the race tied."
"Like, oh man, you know things are bad when Dick Cheney is coming out for Kamala, Karl Rolv is coming out for Kamala, Mitt Romney is coming out for Kamala."
Of 1% are big companies.
It does look like it's truly an effort just to win over this one segment of voters.
"Oh, it's a Trump lead on the RCP average."
"For me, it's just I always hated the idea that you have to buy the newest console when it comes out or you won't be able to play any of the new games."
Here's how to do it.
"I mean, give them the opportunity, more opportunities."
"Yeah, I think we're starting to see more ways people have adjusted to."
The black voters for Trump.
"They were like, I don't know about that because skateboards don't sell that much."
Is there a vibe change that you're seeing in Pennsylvania that your campaign is seeing right now?
"Well, I have been canceled from that whole culture from spreading patterns on weaponized nanotechnology, magnet affection, ivermectin."
"But the question, are these candidates truly on board with the MAGA agenda or just looking to get Trump's seal of approval and the spoils that come with it?"
"Yes, it is possible that a state like Minnesota could flip the Trump at the end of the day or a state like Maine at large."
She's not intelligent.
Pennsylvania to maybe a one-two-point lead.
"But you know, I'm going to give him a little bit of credit."
He doesn't care if he costs more women their reproductive freedoms because it won't make a difference in his life.
That's why he's not connecting well with people because he can't connect well with himself.
He cares about America so much.
" Yesterday, we saw an absolutely terrifying scene at what was supposed to be a Trump town hall rally in Oaks, Pennsylvania."
"Do me a favor, my friend."
His administration failed to remove ineligible voters and clean the voter rolls.
Making the case for herself.
So.
"It's, it's self-righteous."
"All right, Nancy, thank you for that."
We don't know the answer to that question.
The city.
"The Brett Baer interview, of course, is like that was another opportunity to like decide to be honest."
Vote for vote for what really makes sense.
"We've made historic investments in education, in public safety, in economic development."
It sounded like something that he would say on the stage.
"And they have this thing about, you know, they want to put gas out of business."
So of course that was a vice president there reacting to those comments.
Oh my god she's a Russian or Chikom in her case.
"Listen, I had to come and talk about the situation that happened earlier today with Trump."
"But if so, if that's the case, it's even worse because those are typically far more accurate than individual district polling."
"What are you hearing about our current president, President Biden?"
"Women for Trump, Trump girls, they're hardcore supporters."
"It's not as big a deal throughout the state as people think, but in part as to the state, it's a very big deal."
"But looking at the general election matchup, Kamala Harris now takes the lead."
And it's not necessarily in such a vital state.
"And even if he does lose some with, you know, white college educated voters, he loses some of these supporters."
So we met with the crew.
"And the thing is, I bring this up that I would mention to you."
And if it wasn't for the mail-in votes Oz would have won because a lot of these votes were before the debate which everyone agrees was a complete disaster for Federman.

"In the control room, they're telling me how delicious they are."
"Well, I hate to be so crass, but the interview was a train wreck."
"I'm sure there's some things that we would disagree on policy wise, but I think what most Americans feel is a deep commitment to this country and a desire to do right by this country."
"So, you know, and they said two people are in the hospital right now, critically wounded."
Everyone this is all theories.
"There's a reason for this and that's due to economic policy, I think mainly."
So she will and she has to reach across the aisle and she has to convince the voters that she is the kind of moderate who wants to get things done in a bipartisan fashion.
"Yes, because the economy is so, if we had a great economy, why would people have to get second and third jobs?"
I don't agree with my kids.
And I couldn't see the methodology of Rasmussen in terms of the demographics of what they polled in the Rasmussen poll either.
"Despite Trump's attacks, Harris's position on fracking may not be as detrimental as it once seemed."
They don't really align with their current Republican Party.
And then the defense spending through the roof.
"Please go there, sign up for their mailing list, follow them on Twitter."
This is RFK if a part of his brain wasn't eaten by a worm.
It doesn't make sense to.
"In the US right now, I'm pretty sure it's like 100K, but I could be wrong."
"If you look at the battleground states, Pennsylvania offers the most electoral votes out of all of them."
"And I have to say, I've noticed this, especially with some men who think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down and acting all pretend tough guy, that somehow that's a sign of strength."
But those are where the swing voters are.
Trump began.
And Kelly Armstrong basically has won the governorship in North Dakota with her or his primary win.
"What we're at times, passionate, emotional remarks in Pittsburgh, the first stop on his sprint through swing stage four, Kamala Harris."
"One thing we noticed, we did not find any Democrats for Trump, but we did meet Republicans against him."
Huh.
"Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris leads Trump across nationwide polls."
"Interview with the other guy who was a nice guy, I think from Philadelphia, from Pennsylvania."

There have been a lot of positions that she took prior to 2020 in which she's changed course.
Love for country is evident here along with strong divide over what that means.
These are custom.
"It was a tree, all trees."
"Here's Brett Baer, open call."
We saw a group of people inciting people.
It's from Russia because they want Trump to win.
"Hillary Clinton won it by just 2,700 votes in 2016."
It's kind of a thing.
"And if Harris wins Pennsylvania, well, at that point, Trump needs to win a state like Arizona than Wisconsin, just a barely cracked 270."
"Addressing inflation and promoting tangible benefits for citizens, the speaker plans to eliminate wasteful spending and prioritize infrastructure improvements for significant economic enhancement."
But also you have a pollster that had Donald Trump trailing the last poll called the Muhlenberg College poll.
Are you ready to protect freedom?
"Samuel Lin â€“ $4 million Samuel Lin, an investment guru from Philadelphia, has donated $4 million to Harris' campaign."
How do you feel the way Snippy Joe is handling himself as president?
"Three big outliers of Harris plus two, Harris plus three, and of course, Bloomberg with Harris plus five."
That doesn't bother you.
And one of the things you had to do was go into court and basically preserve the kind of integrity of the state's election system underneath the sort of fuselage of lawsuits from the Trump campaign and others.
Now where is the majority of the vote coming from?
There was the smile and the laugh.
So you've run this stand for nine years and you haven't voted?
Let's see what we got here.
 This area we stand on was a little over three years ago was nothing but a forest.
"How we worship, who we marry, what our family looks like."
"When you're talking about dramatic world events that carry a whole lot of significance, be comfortable with uncertainty."
I'm hearing something totally different.
So that's a four and a half point on average lead for Hillary Clinton when she won by two.
I'm not nervous about going.
And it is really hard to see.
"Okay, immigration is third."
"I'm sorry, gentlemen."
So there's a lot of us who are not so woke but still very willing to have discourse and very willing to kind of come to compromises.
Joan London is an attorney for local governments.
"This would be interesting in I don't know if a majority of Polish voters go Republican, but like a good amount of them go Republican So we're kind of with the Haitian vote for the most part you'd be dealing with just boosting turnout Which would boost your numbers here you would potentially be dealing with you know flips right?"
I think the simplest thing is you blame the current administration.
It's over for Harris.
It's pretty obvious that Joe Biden had a unique point of strength in Pennsylvania.
"And with that being said, seeing Donald Trump's willingness to come back to a place where he nearly died, I'm getting off the podcast chair and I'm coming out for the first time in a few years to one of these rallies."
"Instead of having thousands of pathways to winning in this scenario, you have to win everything."
I see the same thing in Georgia.
"But as you mentioned, the issue of the economy still weighs heavy on voters hearts."
But I think what what that clip shows you is how far some candidates are willing to go to genuflect to you know who?
But it's also about what happened down at his golf course on September 15th.
"And so what we found here is with this lead in these three states, it really gives a sense of security to Democrats in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that sure may not and should not translate to a sense of complacency."
"So I would say like a 5150 poll, for example, would actually be better than this kind of a, or I guess that wouldn't be a possibility, right?"
But she's also taking with three weeks left here a pretty stringent stance against things that Donald Trump has been saying.
And I've seen them.
"Now, Bobby, during her recent appearance on ABC's The View, Vice President Harris was asked if she would have done anything differently than Biden during their term together."
"We don't have any active wells on our farm, but I know that we get residuals from mining underneath, like the gas being extracted that way."
Caitlin's been covering it all.
Cost of labor is super high.
They just see families.
"And the production has come from private land, not government land, largely vast majority."
"We've never done anything so extreme ever, ever."
"Clean energy is the little that's the key word that they use to say that it's going to be electric, clean energy."
Even though it's very likely that this election is going to have a more transparent process.
"I like how a family of four can make $67,000 and that's a middle class."
I felt like it was her most genuine and passionate That I saw her pretty much throughout it I Didn't necessarily agree with what she was saying but my favorable reactions were because it was nice to see the passion and Believability that she stands behind and then have something to gauge More of what she says on since she hasn't spoken a lot solidly about a lot of issues And I think what's been interesting again following how you guys were tracking the debate which is a fascinating experience and I should know We nobody in this room has been listening to the postgame coverage.
There's nothing normal about this tonight.
And Trump won this poll by one point.
And it's going to kick off World War Three.
They have college degrees at higher rates.
They both lie a lot.
That's the problem for Harris.
And also he's been talking about her flip-flopping.
We're talking about Democrats and their operations.
So I decided to go back and reread the clause.
This isn't from Trafalgar.
"I know that Trump isn't my choice, and I am still watching and waiting and very hopeful as Vice President Harris keeps moving to the center."
"But I will say, as far as the work is concerned, I'll say be intentional about it because there are souls to be one for Christ."
They shot me in the ear.
"So it shouldn't shock anyone that the polls are within a point or so, or even a dead heat."
"But I think we've seen, for example, when Vance wouldn't say in the VP debate that Donald Trump lost in 2020, that was one of the most problematic moments for swing voters."
"I mean, also remarkable that the former president himself voted by mail."
"And you know, no Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948."
"We have to go all the way back to late July for a head-to-head survey here, and it has Harris up 10 points, 50% to 40%, among 656 likely voters surveyed by SurveyUSA and a local news station in Minneapolis."
Those failed policies haven't worked in the four years that Donald Trump.
"We can take Baltimore and with people like Kim Klasek, we will take Baltimore."
"Well, the polling in the swing states really is what's important."
The second gentleman's head.
And then you get to play those games forever.
"Our movement to make America great again stands stronger, prouder, more united, more determined and nearer to victory than ever before."
"A keystone, if you will, but not always considered a battleground state."
And so Kamala Harris now narrowing down even pre-VP selection in Pennsylvania goes to show that Democrats are in a far better position.
That's why it's not good for Democrats that they're way behind where they should be.
"He would help us maybe a point, but it's not enough."
I'm sitting down with Dick Pullman full-time writer in residence and journalism professor here at Penn He also wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer for 22 years and now writes about politics weekly on his own platform.
"No, not really I pay for my own gas."
Now this is of no surprise because I've been following Kamala and her national political aspirations for a while.
"But then came Kamala Harris, and she completely changed everything, not only on the national level, but also in states like Pennsylvania."
Or are you rooting for Trump?
Nobody's perfect.
"The recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling, which mandates that mail-in ballots be signed and dated, aligns with Trump's position on maintaining strict voting standards."
"Let's see if she can expand her narrow edge now in Pennsylvania, which does award 19 electoral votes."
This emotionally significant visit fostered connections with grieving families.
Play the clip and fought them all the way.

"But they give millions, tens of millions of dollars."
"It was very contentious, but it was a state that Republicans had focused on."
"Also, there's always Unfortunately amongst a lot of immigrant groups like even people whose heritage immigrated here, you know, whatever They'll be anti-immigrant themselves even I think a lot of the Mexicans right now so a very very unfortunate scenario there, but that is kind of the caveat but The only other thing is this does provide you a possibility, right?"
McClelland and Shapiro's office did not respond to requests for comment.
Well today in these blue wall states Vice President Harris is really going after that narrow sliver of those undecided voters specifically suburban women those more moderate Republicans and independents they're really hoping that former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney is going to make a dent with some of those voters who may be unsure about Vice President Kamala Harris but are also frustrated and tired of Donald Trump and Harris's message to them is that they've got a home within the Democratic Party and Liz Cheney is making the pitch that it's because she's deeply conservative that she's backing Harris she says she's putting the Constitution over her party calling Donald Trump unchecked unstable and dangerous.
"So how do you see abortion, Ozzy, at this point impacting this race so close to Election Day, if at all?"

Grandpa?
"So theoretically, it should have caught the surge for Democrats when it comes to voter registration, if there was any."
How would you exactly make that happen?
"So Trump with slight leads there, but Harris very close."
And he burns.
"A lot of analysts are saying she needs to hold that blue wall in the north, which includes us, Michigan, Wisconsin, some of these these rust belt blue collar states."
"That's your opinion, ace."
Is that Elizabeth Taylor?
The former U.S. president was busy on his campaign trail.

"And I know even my bones of Vice President Harris, someone who's going to stand up for our freedom, the women's ability to make their own choices for their pregnancies and their health and that our democracy will be strong and protected when she's in the White House."
"He needs to win back those supporters because, you know, Nikki Haley, she ends up winning one hundred and fifty seven thousand votes."
"I will say, they do, these are very civically engaged people."
That is the laugh of a crazy.
So I can't explain it.
"Well, it's to be out there, people, and see it too."
Different than the formalist.
We do.
"Political watchers are now waiting for the much-touted October surprise, which could potentially tip the balance in the favor of either Trump or Harris drastically."

"Wilkes-Barre, she's going."
"I realize that this this poll was taken before the DNC and, you know, RFK Jr. dropping out all these other things."
What's the state of the campaign there based on your reporting as best you can tell?
You're not getting the permit too.
"Send them to me here or on Instagram, Brett Baer and Roseanne Barr down there responds."
"And so to the extent that Democrats can actually keep abortion front and center, the better they will actually do in a lot of these races."

"Our main concern here is everybody's safety, officer safety as well."
"Pennsylvania is tied, according to Real Clear Politics."
And I think that's the most damning part of J.D.
Tell me about yourself and how you came to like Donald Trump.
Mic drop.
"Yes, I do."
" We are just 22 days away from Election Day, and Vice President Harris and former President Trump are campaigning in the same battleground state today."
You think of Trump.
"And he was grumpy, he was grousing, you still see it poke through every once in a while."
Does it impact your calculation for what you do?
And she has a point.
I'm presuming it was taken after the debate.
"Not having cackling, whatever, without any disrespect."
"I mean, here's the reality of what Trump did today, Wolf, which is sort of pre-butt what we are going to get from Kamala Harris on Friday when she is in that very same now very clear battleground state, North Carolina."
Right now it's R plus two.
14.
Did George Bush have a heart for the common man?
Dramatic is the right way to sum up this election so far.

Support education training and mentorship programs that lead to good paying jobs for black men like black jobs.
Now Harris's path to victory depends on her ability to turn out the Democratic voters of Philly.
Central to Stierwald's analysis is the concept of voter turnout.
What are you guys thinking about it?
"In 2020, they narrowly got by, and in some races, it really didn't work out the way that they thought it was going to be."
A zero point three percent point Trump win.
"Trump's campaign is also heavily focused on Pennsylvania, criticizing Harris on economic issues and trying to shape her image among voters."
"If you think prices are high now, Donald Trump's message is, you ain't seen nothing here."
And that's when you start hearing about truckloads of ballots.
"In recent elections, Pennsylvania has been decided by razor-thin margins."
"Vice President Harris hailed her new running mate as a veteran, six term congressman and two term governor who is prepared to take on their rivals."
"And in this case, 75,000."
"Like I said, I wanted to at the time."
"Kristen, you and I both know well that ticket splitting has gone down in recent years, in recent elections."
"But when you look at this, it's a very good sign for Trump."
We were energy independent.
"Yeah, most polling has Harris up by the narrowest narrowest of margins maybe one to two points So within the margin of error essentially it could go either way with the margin of error It's arguable that Donald Trump actually has the lead You could ask me this question every day from now until November 5th And I think the answer will be the same either candidate could really plausibly win it a small shift at any point Right up to election day could really change the outcome We start wondering what causes one campaign or the other to break out if anything They're both still laying out new policy proposals today Kamala Harris aiming a series of proposals that young black men with business incentives an effort to legalize Cannabis on the federal level Donald Trump continues to introduce tax deductions."
This is bad because this vote block mail-in votes in Pennsylvania.
"Mr. Wallace is gonna be fantastic too, so we're just over the moon."
"The suburban surge, Harris's key to victory?"

"So technically, President Trump could afford to lose Pennsylvania, not that he wants to, obviously, but he could and he could still win the election."
But the registration data looks good.
Vote for Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States.
"His inability to let go of these personal grievances is troubling, especially for someone seeking the highest office in the land."
"The people of Pennsylvania, they see this and they see the attacks that Trump is under."
So let's see.
"I'm on one side, David McCormick's on the other."

Hey.
"Just overall, because I don't like who's running against him."
"Like, it's also that there was a building across the street that could see the whole roof."
Far more Democrats and Republicans vote by mail in Pennsylvania.

"The suburban vote, particularly among white women, has been a key battleground in Michigan."
"As we know in the US elections, it's all about that electoral college vote and amongst the seven swing states, none has more of those electoral votes than Pennsylvania."

Kamala Harris make major improvements relative to President Biden.
He's talked about the strain on health care and housing.
"Yes, Democrats are dominating early voting in Pennsylvania, but Republicans often make up ground on election day itself."
This reflects a long-term trend of shrinking middle class over the past five decades.

"And Matt, we appreciate you being here."
"Hours after the polls closed, then President Trump demanded the counting stop."
Key to where we are today as a country.

That was some some weird stuff in the Trump event.
So that's going to be the tough one to predict.
"This part of the state is about one third, 33% of the overall electorate in the state."
Shapiro uses this example to illustrate the difference between the two.
"The question is those voters who have decided elections in Arizona and frankly elected Democrats in several of them, is that message, which should be a message to me was just kind of a hodgepodge of Democratic liberal positions going to win the race."
We see the Trump campaign focusing on a Harris county that is just so densely populated that getting a small bump in the percentage there could make the difference in Pennsylvania.

"I think when you say she's run a flawless campaign, it's a mistake free one, I guess is a better way."
Now the Harris campaign provided a list of Politico of several examples of surrogate events aimed at engaging voters of color.
"Moving to the sixth poll, also conducted by Quinnipiac University on the same dates with a different 1,738 likely voters, Harris received 50% of the vote, while Trump received 47%."
So black men who make them know their money is safe.
You just can't.
But this isn't the only thing that she's flipped on that you found and you found a lot of other inconsistencies.
The president's campaign says he'll give a speech on economic policy with a major focus on taxes.

We need more entertainment that has that kind of entity to it.
She says the conversations back home among her Philly suburban mom friends are crystal clear.
It's interesting.
Anybody who's about to beat down other people is a coward!
"They both lean Democratic, but really close margins here, and every vote is going to count."
It's now very likely to vote Republican for a third straight cycle.
We get laughed at a lot for some of the shenanigans that our government does.
And right now what they did was they flooded the country with people who they think they can bribe into voting for their candidates.
"There was a Texas representative, Ronnie Jackson, who said that his nephew was grazed in the neck during Trump's rally shooting."
"The crowd was a vast sea of red, white and blue, with enthusiastic attendees proudly sporting Make America Great Again hats and energetically waving Trump flags."
"He just decided, you know what, I'm going to stop taking questions."
A lot of people really aren't saying Trump's going to be like winning any of those states by like three or four points to really skew the average.
Donald Trump swayed on stage with South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem mimicking his dance moves.
"Yeah, I'll be looking forward to seeing how that interaction, if there is one, between the governor and the former president, happens."
Anyways.
"It's not just, you know, oh, he's down by a point."
"Additionally, if rural voters perceive her as disconnected from their needs and aspirations, it could lead to significant losses in key counties that have historically swung elections."
"Now, if it is in fact the tipping point state, is there any elected official in Pennsylvania who may have been on a ticket that might have made a difference?"
They need to know that he's okay.
What a surge for Democrats.
Hence the vote Trump abortion bans that make no exception even for rape and incest Which understand what that means a survivor of a crime of violation?
"This kind of rhetoric is not only harmful, but dangerous."
Identity and race politics is peaking in the United States.

"Son of an immigrant, single mom, growing up, he and his sisters didn't have much."
The animation shows it here.
"So the first question is, is Pennsylvania becoming more Republican?"
You saw what happened in Atlanta with Fani?
"Right, and making that argument is pretty tricky."
"Let's break it down, starting with the first poll."
"But watching that rhetoric in the closing days and weeks is something to behold, nature."
This is a crucial state in Pennsylvania for the November election.
"Well, the advantage has always been to the Democrats, at least in recent history, just based on voter registration."
It doesn't matter.
"In Charleroi, Pennsylvania, seen a 2000% increase in the population of their town."
"Vice President Kamala Harris and her newly announced running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, are out on the campaign trail."
"And I know, I know that you all embrace being the city of brotherly love, but I'm going to get real with you right here."
"In fact, our mantra was running to be the best, to demonstrate that, you know, regardless of the direction in which I pray, the direction in which I lead is a strong direction and the direction in which that can uplift all the communities across the city of Dearborn."
This is really the first time in a while he's been meaningfully leaning in Pennsylvania.
I said it's going to be a closed state regardless of what happens.

"Yeah, Twitter back and forth."
"And to be completely honest with you, it's very frustrating."
"I mean, I'd be dead serious."

"So they're trying to distract and talk about other things instead of what most people are concerned about, which is often something very basic like, you know, the cost of groceries and how much people pay at the grocery store."
Please tell me he's not going to die.
Donald Trump won that by 29 and 24 points the last two elections.
"Sure, and I think that's a reasonable concern for some Democrats to have."
Will they have to spend more money there?
"But again, these are ancestral Democrat counties."
So that was a non-news story yesterday.
You know there are real issues at the border.
I think they have a tide now in terms of a popular vote.
"In a unique strategy, the Harris campaign is using Republican voices to court rural GOP voters."
Literally every other pollster found the race tied.
He's going back today.
"Actually, being a human being, I'm not in favor of that sort of thing."
He's got an extensive ground game with private volunteers and local field offices and stuff like that.
A system Trump sought to overturn to his advantage.
These margins underscore Pennsylvania's status as a true battleground state.
And I know I've gotten a lot of questions about how the hurricane is going to impact the election in North Carolina.
"I've noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior of bullying and of putting people down is a sign of strength."

Let's listen.

David.

It really has.
"I've been telling you guys, they don't want him jailed."
"Because you know, this Trump train don't stop."
And she's chosen the person that she believes can help her win this election and that she believes can help her best govern.

Let's think about this.
He's talking about Hannibal Lecter.
I watched Marco over the weekend on television.
"Nope, she'll be all right."

And that tells me something that coalition is expanding that I wrote about in the Great World as opposed to drinking.
"And I really hope that when they're in office, we can continue to bring prices down."
He'll secure our borders.
Across the region here we've seen a loss of manufacturing jobs steel industry other manufacturing work and that's something that people are really feeling and have felt for decades and very much so this was a group in 2016.
"And I think one of the reasons for that is just what I spoke about, the concentrated effort by very powerful forces, the wealthiest people on the planet Earth, descending upon Pennsylvania to hit both of us pretty hard."
Democrats need a firewall of about 390 votes to feel okay that they have a good enough shot of winning the state of Pennsylvania.
And she was pretty blunt about the need for more cultural understanding from the campaign.
"In addition to that, he's being joined by Elon Musk on the trail as well in Pennsylvania."
"It requires physically opening an envelope, removing it, removing the ballot from the envelope, verifying the accuracy of the way it was filled out, inserting it into a machine so that it gets scanned."
"According to what he mentioned, the package provides priority to resources for schools and students who are in the greatest need."
I really don't eat a lot of beef anymore.
"Yeah, there are undecided voters still."
Trump hugged the flag.
"Now, so those are his intentions."
"We've been trying to prepare financial markets for not just the kind of policy they could expect under these two different potential presidents, but frankly, how long it is going to take to figure out who is going to be the president of the United States."
"When you think about where Kamala Harris was really improving support on for, compared to Joe Biden, minority voters, specifically black voters, in some of the polls that we saw with Biden in Pennsylvania, he was losing ground from black voters compared to 2020."
"But relative to the military, to veterans, as you were touching on, we saw generals Millie and Mattis weighing in."
"Polls show that the former president has erased Kamala Harris' gains in the key battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and even Nevada."
His children go to a Jewish day school.
Whoever Harris does select as her number two could have an impact on this race.
"The most interesting part of the Pew report is finding that the middle class is shrinking, not only because more people are poor, but also because more people are rich."
So they're right there with MSNBC watchers.
"And people filed out of that auditorium, or that space, wherever that was."
"So really, like you said, hitting home on who are you and who will you be if you are in that seat?"
And he's also spending time there because he loves Pennsylvania.
"You've been eaten alive with inflation and all I'm doing is getting you back to even Harris tonight focused on the economy too in Western Pennsylvania, making the case that her policies will help middle America and trying to reach out to black voters, stopping at a black owned business in Erie today."
Considering the fact that y'all are not quiet as fuck ever since the shooter has been identified as not black and if he was y'all would be running y'all fucking mouths right now.
Rural voters.
The headline on one of his recent sub stack blog posts.
"In order for people to feel, in order for Democrats to feel comfortable about Bob Casey Jr. beating McCormick in the Pennsylvania Senate race, Democrats need to have banked around 335,000 votes."
This campaign is about a recognition that frankly over the last several years there's been this kind of perversion that has taken place I think.
"But also I was having so much fun that day while yesterday, because I mean, it's just a once in a lifetime opportunity to meet a president and especially a president that we voted for twice."
I'm not a cat lady.
I'm different hard fly.
"The states joined battleground Wisconsin, Michigan, and the all-important Pennsylvania as the six toss-up states in the Cook Political Report ratings."
I've only voted for Barack Obama.
" So, earlier this week, we traveled to Pennsylvania as part of our tour for survey and fact-finding on the supporters and donors working toward the actualization of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz's presidential victory."
"I think the most disconcerting part when you hear the most aggressive, darkest themes from Donald Trump is that you also have to consider that it reflects the support of a large portion of this country."
I think there is a danger that they tune the president out.
So that's why all of this election integrity is so important.
It's incredible.
"And at that point, I think Harris the favorite, because if you lose a single state of your Trump, not just, you know, oh, he could afford to lose Wisconsin, but still win somewhere else."
He has peddled former President Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 election.
"Caitlin, it sounds like Bob doesn't have the reporting quite hammered out with regard to what role former President Trump plays in this effort to repeal no excuse mail-in voting."
"Not me though, I have bad eyesight."
"There's no question that there is anything other than a very, very nasty incident that's taken place."
"And so things like that that maybe are difficult to track with economic data that people do see on a day-to-day basis, especially, again, in an area where we're used to being known as a low cost of living area, and it doesn't feel like that anymore."
Donald Trump is winning Pennsylvania.
Trump said he says Nancy Pelosi caused the insurrection.
The argument that he made was that Vice President Harris has been successful in creating genuine ties with voters who are members of the working class.
And I feel like that's important.
"The event, held on August 1, 2024, was Trump's first appearance in the state since a harrowing incident at a previous rally, which had left many supporters concerned for his safety."
So this is the actual envelope in these where the ballots are returned in?
So anyone trying to extrapolate what it means for November is just talking out of their ass.
"Could be like sort of lean right, could be a toss up."
"Yes, some of them are mad about how far apart my eyes are."
I don't think that's a good course for them.
Fast forward to today and what do we have?
And he couldn't even do that right.
I think it's a 0.4 percentage point average for Harris and Trump.
President Biden went on the airwaves to advocate for the Vice President.
Where was Obama and Schumer?
And Harris lost the poll by two points.
And we'll see how things shake out.
"Donald Trump at every turn has fought to take us backwards, to strip us of our fundamental rights and freedoms."
"You know, Republicans love to talk a good game about freedom, yet it's Democrats."
"Yesterday, Donald Trump's town hall event just outside of Philadelphia was seemingly cut short when members of the crowd fainted."
"Now, they're known for their party affiliation data, which has been crazy accurate in predicting the popular vote like for decades."
Well Nora as you know this is a swing area and of course we've got a range of reactions from our voters who watched this entire debate.
For those of you who aren't aware and it's okay if you are it's Saturday and this was just a couple of hours ago so it's still new news still unfolding as we speak.
"Donald Trump left office with net loss of 3 million jobs, with a 6.3% unemployment rate, with an economic contraction of 3.4%."
"Despite what Trump and the smattering of people in his audience who were supposedly from Charleroi say, the effect of the Haitian immigrants on the town of Charleroi has been far from disastrous."
"Good evening, Pennsylvania."
"A second morning consult poll from the same date September 19 to 25 and the same 920 for likely voters mirrors the previous result, with Harris leading by five points, 51% to Trump's 46%."
I find that fascinating.
He wins every tournament at his golf club.
"It's gonna be a straight dog fight and who's gonna it's a pure toss-up right now The only state I think that's really a harder dog fight is North Carolina So even the smallest of a little thing can change this result in terms of Pennsylvania It's gonna be so damn close But we're gonna look at this here and see how close it's gonna be in terms of what's going on with this Polish American vote So it says Polish Americans are not an ethnic group that typically gets mentioned in modern American presidential debates So when vice president Kamala Harris noted Pennsylvania's large Polish American population as she discussed the threat that Russia posed to Poland Timothy el kuzma said was pleasantly surprised you start talking about Poland and Polish Americans His ears are gonna perk up said mr Kuzma national president of the Polish Falcons of America a Non-for-nonprofit fraternal benefit organization that provides life insurance for its members and is based in Pittsburgh and the battleground state of Pennsylvania Polish Americans who comprise more than 5% of the population are an important if politically overlooked demographic many of Pennsylvania's roughly 700,000 Polish Americans share a common fear that Vladimir v. Putin has ambitions to restore the former Soviet Union's sphere of influence in Eastern Europe Including Poland so 700,000 Polish Americans in the state and what's interesting enough?"
And right now they have Trump up by two.
"Kristen, thanks for joining us today."
This is why she came out after the election when she lost and she never really got over that or admitted it by the way.
So it'll be really interesting to look at some of the exit polling on the gender gap here at Geneva.
It's going to be way too expensive under her proposed tax increase.
"There's crowd stood behind him, which also is concerning."
"We're a part of history, for sure, Ozzy."
It's tempering itself a little bit.
So that's real important.
"Instead, it became a spectacle of incoherence, with Trump struggling to form complete sentences and obsessing over personal grievances."
The evidence showed that all these stories were fake.
"Her journey from California senator to the second highest office in the land is an inspiration to many, particularly women and minorities who see themselves reflected in her accomplishments."
Bill Clinton has been out there saying you know if we vetted people maybe they wouldn't be murdered by illegal aliens.
It makes no sense.
"Now, you know, the campaign likes to let the former president speak for himself."
"If she were alive today, she would be a Republican."
"My mother worked hard, raised me and my sister, and by the time I was in high school, she was able to afford our first time."
It's not hard to see why.
"If I'm over there, I'm going to stop it."
"We are into the Democratic Convention in around a week, we will be watching the first speeches on the floor in a number of days."
"At the same time, they had Biden up by eight points in August of 2020."
It's more of a party that accepts big government in some instances.
I don't want nobody over 70 running.
I know what it's like to come from a working class family.
So walk us through how you do it.
"And in either case, it'd be the same exact people that are the staff behind Kamala and Biden."
The Supreme Court.
"Libby, let me begin with you."
And so that is an issue right there for that poll.
"We saw it when no matter the race of the individual who he's talking about, if he doesn't have a substantive message, he starts to go personal."
"I mean, 60%."
"I thought she hit herself really well on foreign policy and all Donald Trump did was say, well, it would have never happened this way and never would have happened that way and offered absolutely no concrete evidence for that."
The answers are fascinating.
They just worship their God who is Trump.
"If it is as close as again as it was in 2020, it could take a while, especially with mail-in ballots."
It's nerve-racking.
"Unless the critiques are about breathing and stuff like that, they're not going to be real."
"The interplay between urban and rural voters, the critical importance of turnout, and the historical context of voting patterns all converge to underscore the complexity of the state's electoral landscape."
"I can definitely understand the mindset, especially when you are of the mentality that, you know, Trump is going to fix all of our problems, you know, and I believe Trump is not the solution."
And now he wants to do it again.
"Charleroi, the town that Trump references in that clip, is a town in southwestern Pennsylvania."
That's over 40 years ago.
He pretended to be Scranton Joe.
"And for campaigning for that job and potentially holding it for four years, after he withdraws and is replaced by Kamala Harris, the same questions have not been applied, I think, to the same degree to Donald Trump."
"And again, raising questions about Donald Trump's mental fitness."

He was personally insulting her.
"Like, you're not running against Biden."
"In today's time, I'm almost afraid to admit that because people look at you like you're crazy because everything is so divided."
They are currently 50% of the way there with early voting only having been taken place for a week.
Which is I mean just obviously completely the opposite of Trump's campaign.
I think Donald Trump did really bad in Delaware County.
"This issue is particularly sensitive for Pennsylvania's voters, and Harris's ability to defend her position could be a turning point in the election."
Harris's growth in Pennsylvania underscores how critical this state has become.
I think you said it's about 75 percent.
They're eating the pets.
Nothing else comes close.
"You know, remember with the purple background, the pink and purple."
It seemed to go on forever and ever about the private parts of the golfing great.
"But now for the first time, I'm beginning to think it might be an age issue."
And these companies on their prices and keep pointing out when they're jacking up their prices on food and household items and forcing people to pay higher prices just because they can get away with it because they can unless you have price gouging legislation passed.
You said you don't sell soap to people who don't wash.
But I also certainly understand the feeling that we now have with a new generation stepping forward.
Pennsylvania's got the fourth largest natural gas reserves in the world.
I just put up the post.
Great point.
"Pennsylvania, huh?"
"These migrants had come to Springfield at the town's request, as the local economy was struggling, and they were in need of workers."
That's all that matters.
That is exactly true.
"If he could merely stick to a teleprompter for 60 plus days, he could win the whole thing."
And I'm not particularly shy about what I hear.
Trump is on track.
You're golden.
"So Harris, if she wins it, I really think she's got the presidency."
"By ensuring that mail-in ballots are subject to strict requirements, the ruling may reduce the number of ballots that could otherwise be counted for Democratic candidates."
This district's gonna swing back in November.
That's why it was a warning sign when they had Trump up in battleground states in older maps.
"And we should have a leader of this nation, a leader of the free world who at least meets those standards that most parents try and hold their children to."
What are you going to do if you're president?
"There's a lot more, so it's kind of like you just pick and choose."
"Stierwald emphasizes that Harris's ability to effectively communicate her positions on pressing issues, such as the economy, healthcare access, and social justice initiatives, will be fundamental to her campaign."
"Normally they pleaded guilty to the Haber-Dashery Act or crossing the street without a signal, something like that."
And I think that's also why we're starting to see some numbers here.
"But I think this is reflective of as we actually get closer to Election Day, people are starting to pay attention."
It's the same exact thing Ohio does.
"Now there was a big decline in 2020 because of COVID, obviously nobody was traveling, cars, planes and all that."
You had to go through metal detectors.
"As soon as Kamala set her sights on the White House, things got, shall we say, flexible."

Turn that music up.
Today we're diving into the heated battleground of Pennsylvania as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump ramp up their campaigns for the 2024 election.
It's not just about having resources.
"It's really, really it's a really, really tight election."
"And President Trump is winning Pennsylvania right now in many of the battleground states because again, people in many of the battleground polls, rather, because people there realize their lives were better off under his leadership."
1400 days you don't get another 1460 days on the other hand you had President Biden holding a very serious press conference today But of course the media asks him some of the dumbest questions here play this clip.
"There was a recent judicial decision with regards to the certification of the election there, which I find hilarious."
I do not oppose fracking.
"Sam Brown, he was endorsed by Trump."
The increased security presence we got on the ground here yesterday and well over 24 hours before this rally was set to begin the area and the site was completely locked down so heightened security here actually the U.S. Secret Service had extended the security perimeter and they're going to have personnel stationed on that shed where the shooter fired shots but the dynamics of this rally are are similar we've talked to a lot of supporters here who are eager to see the former president return they think that this sends an important message him coming back here and we also spoke to someone who was here that day in July on July 13th at that rally and felt that he needed to return here just as the president is.
"When you see what happened in Pennsylvania, do you see a microcosm for something that could be playing out nationwide among some Republicans skittish about Trump or is it more just a protest and they'll come home in November?"
"We're not going back to the dark days of ripping away people's freedom, of telling women what to do with their bodies and their pregnancies."

"But historically, the numbers are actually on par right now with black men."
"But that's kind of what makes election year so fascinating, right?"

Enforced savings.

Ave Maria?
"The article mentioned she's also questioning if he's fit to be president, even challenged him to release his medical records."
So I make all my money tattooing.
"Well, Harris is certainly using this issue."
Is that drop off big enough to endanger Harris's chances at winning key battleground states?
"They were coming in through a system that we had, which was great because I'm the best thing that ever happened to farmers."
"But beyond that point, there wasn't much else that Donald Trump could really uplift."
Donald Trump has not won a popular vote in the elections where he's been at the top of the ballot.
All of this chaos that we're seeing in the world right now can be laid right at the feet of the Harris Biden administration.
I do think Lisa Slotkin could do well.
Kamala Harris is coming back to North Carolina today.
Just let me know in the comments down below.
"Yeah, you'll see me."
Some don't.
I just want you to understand that means that we don't know.
"They can't fix every fucking problem for every single person, bro."
"And this year, it feels even more crucial."

"But if anything, he's like slipped up a little bit in the polls and Federman still has a pretty big lead."
"But again, there's probably a lot of brainwashed voters for the other side to win."
Biden's endorsement of Harris only pushing her further away.
"And that is the problem for Donald Trump, because it would be one thing at the New York Times in a college poll was a fluke and he tried to write it off as such."

"â€”So, as you know, I worked for him for 10 years."
"So we both had great credit, but we both had mortgages and we both had debt, right?"
She's making real gains among Republicans.
My all time favourite chart.
And is the Harris campaign doing that?
"He tried to die in office They have no shame Let's get them through this election Let's get rid of this trump era once and for all the right way Not by assassins bullets, but let's get rid of trump the right way And then we get that progressive movement pushing harder and harder Okay But the line that i'm pushing for y'all Is Gretchen Whitmer governor of michigan who will instantly take michigan?"

"I mean, it's not scientific."
The heightened security measures underscored the volatile political climate and the very real concerns surrounding Trump's safety.
"So yeah, so that happened."
"Recent polls show Harris leading Trump in key states like Arizona and North Carolina, although she trails slightly in Nevada and Georgia."
So she's already down by two to three points and this is when she should be pulling her best.
I've been canceled for it.
We need to take this country back.
"I think it could impact the discourse, but so far the discourse has not really impacted the general election quite a bit, although I will say that if Hunter does not get jail time, it's going to be really hard to justify putting Trump in jail and seeing it significantly hurt him because that's just going to be the two-tier justice system on full display, unlike anything we've ever seen."
"We do remember Dick Cheney's the guy who was seen as like this side of Henry Kissinger, the worst foreign policy, even though he wasn't really foreign policy."

I don't think so.
So it's not clear yet as what impact on Saturday's shooting will have on the security plans for the Republican National Convention scheduled to begin Monday in Milwaukee according to the source familiar with the plan in the event.
Be yourself.
That I think would be the easiest way to victory.
So I got it.
"For now, Shapiro says he's focused on electing Harris and serving as Pennsylvania's governor."
It says it's designed to make it easier for people who support Mr. Trump to volunteer to help his campaign.
"Now, along with that, right, why is she outreaching to rural areas of Pennsylvania?"

She's now headed to Michigan today.
"And still, it's not moving the needle."
Every vote in the Keystone state could be the key to the White House.
Is it possible that she takes it maybe in reverse?
We'll leave no doubt about who we are and what America stands for and together we'll keep building a country that's more fair and more equal and more just and more free.
It's really exciting because we haven't had a total darkness outside since November through March.
She'll do well in Allegheny County.
"What is it about specifically Allentown, your county, your region, that has these candidates in such a tight race, do you think?"
Our election is about understanding the importance of this beautiful country of ours in terms of what we stand for around the globe as a democracy.
"Jeff Gunter was stronger, but he didn't really have much of a chance."
"I mean, if he's winning Pennsylvania, it's just not going to happen."
"And the other one I pointed out in the video, this is incredible, too."
"We've seen it before earlier this summer as he jumped in the race, as he tapped her to take his place and pass the torch to her."
Everyone's voting.
"Kamala, I have the support of 200 Republicans, including Cheney and Romney."
I was right about the crime stats going way up.
I'm sounding like Colin.
"As far as Michigan goes, let's be very clear."
Now they got an important role to play in making sure Kamala Harris is the next president of the United States.
"Walk in, order your donut."
"For someone like Kamala Harris who appeals to progressives and is doing very, very well right now at the Democratic base, Shapiro helps her with independent voters, it helps her with non-college educated voters that she might not appeal to right now."
"Milwaukee today, areas of Detroit today, and also Philadelphia in the southeast corner today all for Kamala Harris."
I see shades of the Hillary Clinton campaign with the arrogance of a Democratic Party out of touch with the electorate.
That makes no sense I want to ask I see you're a person of color obviously in the media Trump's constantly called racist Have you heard that stuff?
"However, she said recent voting initiatives within the divine nine have further strengthened bonds between members, including men."
You know where I'm going with this.
"As a young Democrat, that really matters to me."
"As you say, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear 46 looks like the future as one Democrat put it to me, but Vice President Harris with Governor Beshear, a real picture of the future."
"It didn't matter if you list 10, 15 policies that they all like, everything that he was doing as a president, but they weren't willing to vote for him."
You can't take this seriously.
And that's a very hard argument to make because people think they're eyewitnesses to what the next Trump presidency is going to be like.
But one thing is for sure Pennsylvania is shaping up to be one of the most critical battlegrounds in the 2024 election.
Where's this mystical surge at?
"It may all come down to the electoral college, which rockets Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro to the top of the list."
And there she came to talk about cutting costs.
It would be funny if it wasn't so dangerous.
These are where they think they can get a pool of voters who Potential voters who may stay home or maybe though they're gettable.
And so he brings George H.W.
I'm very work hard.
"Yeah, he's great."
"On Fox News, he largely focused on immigration and the border."
"Oh, yeah."
I'm not talking about the clean again on the streets he's talking about about the criminals.
"Every time there's a new update, it gets even worse for Democrats like okay fine."
"Look, I want to see Kamala Harris deliver her vision for a future for all Americans, particularly for young Americans."
And I'll tell you why that is because he's not being honest with himself every day.
I was able to go back as far as twenty twenty one and I paid four dollars and change in twenty twenty one for thirty six pack of eggs.
"But it is a good indicator, especially if it's like every single update, it's more and more Republican."
People are very upset still about the doubt's decision.
This makes me sick.
"Another question, Joe D. What are your thoughts on the Biden hair strategy was to deplete the strategic petroleum reserve to help reduce the cost of gas starting prior to the midterms?"

"Voters said they trusted him, trusted Trump on taxes, on housing, on all these issues."
"I've been waiting for her to laugh because as soon as she laughs, the election's over."
"And he's out there saying, well, everyone wanted it this way."
16 million are now reportedly eligible to vote in their first presidential election.
So it's like this false narrative that's being pushed.
"It's ridiculous, actually, if you're refusing to front the press or even start to at least outline some of your policies."
"All right, Linda."
And that path to breaking through might begin with answering the question posed to you in the first place.
But who how times have changed.
Donald Trump's most efficient path to 270 electoral college votes would be to win the Sun Belt swing states of North Carolina and Georgia and flip Pennsylvania.
Casey's been in the Senate a long time since 2007 and McCormick made the most of that.
"Remember, this is what is called the century city."
But the people of North Carolina would like to leave it as Fort Bragg.
"Good morning, checking in."
He doesn't think he's any better than you.
It's only one metric.
Let's see if we can make it a reality.
"Meantime at a Bloomberg town hall yesterday, Trump falsely claimed there was a peaceful transfer of power back in 2020."
" The countdown is on 15 days till the midterm elections and candidates in one of the most closely watched races will face off tomorrow, exactly two weeks until the election."
"Trump was in Pennsylvania a few weeks ago for a fundraiser outside Philadelphia and to hold one of his traditional rallies in Lehigh County, an area Biden won by seven points in 2020."
He could be his own man and he says what he's what is on his mind and he's been consistent through the decades.
Rivals have accused him of switching from liberal to conservative positions.
And that's not something that they want to feed into.
We begin with yet another campaign stop by presidential candidate.
Kamala Harris received 51 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 45 percent.
"Okay, hold on."
"Far, far, far better for Kamala Harris than you see in some of these other states rather rather other websites like Real Clear Politics in Pennsylvania."
"Yeah, all right, Matt O'Donnell, always a pleasure to talk with you."
"Yeah, so President Trump and of course, VCF, they're all in town today, just visiting areas like here, Morgan State University, just letting these students know that there is an option."
"Now the latest poll here in Texas from Public Policy Polling surveyed on August 21st and 22nd has Trump up 5 points among 725 registered voters, 49% to 44%."
"Marcus Conte reporting live from the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Trump rally."
"When you have half of your voters vote by mail, like we did in 2020, counting those votes takes time."
"If you don't do that, mathematically speaking, you cannot win."
Could it be a far right poll?
That raises the question.
And that becomes the center and the just the normal and the average.
"He was kind of excusing the companies, I guess, either directly or indirectly, excusing companies for engaging in price coaching like it's, you know, it's OK to to gouge someone."
"And that's wild, that's never been witnessed."
"But I'm really talking to talk Erie right now, which is 103.3, 105.5 and 1530 a.m. up there in Erie."
She'll be all right.
"At the same time, some Democrats were equally concerned about Josh Shapiro being on the ticket."
What do you do when you're a presidential candidate and your withering attacks on a marginalized group in a struggling small town aren't paying off like you hoped they would?
I haven't done them yet.
"It is very similar to the rest of the country, demographically, socioeconomically, and in its diversity."
So who would I say would be the best candidate?
And will it be by enough to give Trump the victory in Pennsylvania?
Who's she trying to reach?
It's a message to the Deep State is what it is a message to the Deep State.
"I told my buddy, he said, I'll never vote for Donald Trump."
If you think about it.
And then Donald Trump shortly thereafter calls Pennsylvania a state instead of a commonwealth.
Israel has denied targeting civilians as it continues to hunt down Hamas militants.
And that's we have to respect that.
I'm realistic.
I've had conversations with some individuals who feel that not voting at all because of the apathy that they feel and the demonstration that all the work that's happened over the last 11 months has led to nothing.
Wait till January.
"If Poles, the Polish Americans, are to count."
"And then like a spider web, you have tentacles that reach out for miles that collect the natural gas and pipe it back up."
Or abortion.

"You know, we had these, we would have these meetings where all of the Democratic centers would get together for lunch."
Donald Trump.
"I'm thinking more like Colorado, actually, but that would be my holiday destination choice, but that would be selfish of me."
"Now is the final in 2022, roughly 68%."
I will catch you guys in the next episode.
Why are we doing this?
I don't get it either.
But it does make you focus on the things that matter and the things that you care about and that you don't want to take for granted.
"So Nydia, the vice president is in Pennsylvania as well this morning."
That could be fun.
 It is good to be back.
"Nate Silver calling out Alan Lichtman, actually."
"And really, I thought there was going to be some correction and maybe there was some slight correction cause Trump went up by about 12 and it's come back down a little bit."
And now Donald Trump has a lead.
"Oh, there it goes."
She was direct.
We'll see you.
"You know, 27 percent of the people say they don't have enough information about Kamala Harris."
"But his method of doing so, I find, would not I would venture to say would not be pleasing to most of your constituents."
"The court's ruling in Pennsylvania thus represents a pivotal moment in this ongoing debate, as it underscores the Republicans' commitment to reinforcing election security."
"So if you think of the song of Trump's sing in the hallelujah dancing to the hallelujah song, oh, it was deliberately chosen."
I used to live alone before I knew you.
I'll never forget there and keep that hundred dollar bill framed up there.
"They only need one seat if Donald Trump wins the White House, two seats if Kamala Harris wins."
But what has not been widely reported because there's just so much of it out there and you almost have to to catalog all the the anecdotal data.
Squashing claims made by rival Kamala Harris that Donald Trump's rallies don't have big numbers.
Voter fraud never happens.
Question of course is it's going to be enough on the balance.
I think about this a lot because it's so different from what we see right now out of the Republican nominee and increasingly the entire party has just decided it's okay.
The stock market's had an amazing rally and hit record highs and a lot of people have investments if it's through an IRA or 401k.
And we just saw the two candidates for Senate there face off Senator Bob Casey and businessman Dave McCormick had a spirited debate tonight in Pennsylvania is also where Donald Trump and Kamala Harris spent much of the day on Monday.
Why are y for this event?
My goodness gracious every 400 years.
I think they will.
"And again, we asked it retrospectively."
They're trying something.
One thing you notice when you get here is just the enhanced security.
She's going to be tied to the Biden record regardless of what she says or what she does.
Everybody just kind of say what you want to hear.
It was all him.
"He's going to do really well, and I think he's going to change a lot of minds for people in my generation."
"And there are downbell at races in New York that are crucial in 20, 24 to hold so that you have a, you know, house that's Republican so you can work with it."
Like me personally like of what I like been through it like in life Like we we've been through it.
"He leads by two in Pennsylvania, and you have third-party candidates that are polled in the mix, but these are pretty reasonable numbers."
And it's very important.
"That doesn't mean they were Biden voters back in 2020, but now they're voting for Harris."
"Many are coming in from jails and prisons and mental institutions and saying the sounds that's like, you know, step above, right?"
How do you look at the differential there?
"Kamala Harris is winning right now, and I think Donald Trump is just waking up to that, which is why you're seeing some of the attacks and his return to X and the sort of meltdown of an interview with Elon Musk."
"Yeah, I think this is just one of those problems where I don't think we're going to have as big of an aberration as we did in 2016."
So the same people were talking about.
You should see the ads on our television station.
Anything else we should be thinking about?
"And Trump, there's sort of a bit of a positive reassessment of him since he's been president by some folks that might be helping him as well."
Pennsylvania is not a battleground state and you don't have to win the Commonwealth to win the White House.
"The point is, if you elect Kamalinton, they will not be focused on their problems."
"But still, Trump's endorsement is doing well."
Kamala Harris received 47 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 48 percent.
I know a lot of wives that would not say that.
"And I've always been saying this, that Erie picks the winner of Pennsylvania, and then Pennsylvania picks the president."
"Harris' campaign is calling for another debate, but Trump, who previously insisted on multiple debates, is now noncommittal."
Subscribe now and stay ahead of the entertainment curve.
Pennsylvania and Florida.
"Let's hit a few other topics now, Kayla."
It's not even believable.
"He said about how he would vote, quote, he said first he would be voting no."
We've already opened the door and we've already seen what's happened even in this short time of opening that door.
Or they would have charged him that way.
We're not reinventing it.
"And Donald Trump told ABC six, he was bragging about terminating Roe v Wade."
"That's going to be very, very important."
Let's take a listen to what she told me and then we'll talk about it on the other end.
"In some states, it looked like Biden was winning, like in Florida, because they were counting the absentee votes as they came in."
"And in 2020, Joe Biden lost it by 2.3%."
"Okay, let's see."
The first is a town hall.
A first question.
" Moderate voters in Pennsylvania don't really want to vote Kamala, although they don't like Donald Trump that much either."
What does that mean under our system?
"The polling data from Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada highlights a competitive landscape as we approach the elections."
It looks like Trump's in a very good position to win the state.
She was not popular.
"They have hundreds of them, and they wait."
That is a inversion of what we had seen in their last poll which found Harris at 50 and Trump at 48.
"It is so close that we don't know how it's going to go, right?"
We're for fracking.
"And so Harris had kind of had this momentum leading into this kind of this honeymoon phase, irregardless."
Let me just show you a clip of Biden play the clip.
And do you think that may have hurt his chances in any way?
We have had enough of arrogance and bumbling and bluster and division.
This isn't from some far-right news organization.
I want to be able to trust what I hear from the person who's going to be president.
So what do you think?
"I'd love to see what the actual issue is with that in terms of speeding up the vote, the vote counting process."
That hurts the industry.
"And frankly, it's made this race very competitive."
Not at all if here's how we're going to balance the budget to reduce the deficit.
We felt like this is probably going to be his most important rally that he does before the election.
"And you know, this whole talk about project 2025 and they're just trying to attach that to Trump and they're saying that that has nothing to do with Trump."
They say the event was invite only.
There's momentum for Harris.
"But we're going to start with CBS News political correspondent Caitlin Huey Burns in Butler, Pennsylvania."
And this is the World Bank of the suburban voters and the middle class households.
John Federman is here for the working man.
"Haitian voodoo might be real, but you know what else is real?"

He is only focused on himself.
He cared more about winning an election than he did to actually solve the problem.
Bob Casey is authentic.
Why do I emphasize that?
"It was in the news, the child comet and it was spoken of the the dragon."
So you look at all the big musicians.
We talk about a split screen.
So I think that a lot of people are reading into this type of stuff way too much and that's the way it is.
Beautiful.
"Additionally, Shapiro took advantage of the occasion to showcase his own accomplishments in the state of Pennsylvania, particularly his work on education reform, which he has accomplished across the political spectrum."
And I need Bob Casey in the United States Senate.
I would say it's just a constant function.
12.
Values we were taught a few weeks ago.
So I have registered over 40 b and some of their family registered.
"Trump's support for fossil fuels and deregulation has strong appeal in energy-producing regions, while Harris's focus on transitioning to renewable energy is gaining traction in urban areas concerned with climate change."
"In one word, summarize your feeling about that choice you had."
The answer is probably not.
Don't they?
"Well, I wouldn't say that if you're just talking about, I mean, maybe Pennsylvania, there might be a 0% chance."
"A quick reminder, this was happening right when the Harris quote unquote surge was happening."
"And if Donald came back, I know it's safer, you know?"

"OK, so Lisa, how are Republicans responding to all of this?"
It does not happen in this year.
"They shifted a portion of them down to Maryland, but the majority of them were lost and gone for good."
"Well, now they have something to compare it to."
I don't forget what it was when Donald Trump was in the White House.
"Again, some areas where perhaps Donald Trump has shown some weakness with traditional voters as Republican voters rather, as sort of that Republican coalition is being reimagined and repurposed by the Trump campaign."

So to this two percent is huge This one has a zero so some of these polls have and this is another one that has West at two percent the bull Finch group these ones have some pretty crazy polls going on right now for for Kamala Harris And so they have West here at two some of the other ones have zeros This one has one so he's definitely pulling at some numbers in some of these polls for sure and a lot of them He's not included and then in others he's getting zero like in this one and some of the other ones But zero might also be rounded down.
Like what percentage are going to be for black entrepreneurs and what are going to be for others?

These polls show just how unpredictable Pennsylvania is.
The margin of error in our CBS News polling is 2.3 points.
You really do got to hope for what's best.

"According to ABC News, six officials are on the list of vice presidential candidates, including Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly."
"And to a certain degree, I get it."
"We really haven't hit the campaign strides and Donald Trump has gone up in the polls despite being on trial too, which is something that needs to be taken into account."
It's been disheartening because it feels like the healthy staples that moms want to be their families are what is just out of hand.

Please be safe.
I'll get your reaction on the other side.

And so wouldn't you want to give them no excuses by making the election process?
"2020, he lost it, but the polling was still off by six points."
"How'd that work out for you, Senator?"
That's true There are still folks who say they need to know more about Kamala Harris They know a whole lot about President Biden and not not a lot of people like President Biden and the policies Should Kamala Harris separate herself more clearly from President Biden I Think in everything that the way she's lived her life and during her career throughout all of that She's distinguished herself very clearly from from Trump on this and that's that's where I'm at.
What do we find that happens because of that?
"She's talking about investing in small businesses, putting money into small businesses and cutting taxes."
Federman ran several points behind the winning Democratic gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro.
"So for example, back in May, Trump led independents by 10 points."
She's starting off in Philadelphia and reportedly she will have her running mate with her.

"Andrapal, thank you for your inputs."
"McCormick clearly distinguishing himself on key policy ideas, which is something Casey didn't really do when I pressed him on it."
"We spoke with the vice president of public safety here at Temple, who wants to assure that all attendees will or should feel safe, knowing that the Leah Corps Center has hosted a lot of these major events in the past, and they're also going to have help from the Secret Service today as well."

Baltimore is not an area that's going conservative.
In one room we see the span of the MAGA coalition.
Is that is is that what do you think he looks like with his shirt up?
What do you get this right?
"It quite literally if the Senate ends up 50 50 in favor of Democrats because of Kamala Harris is the tiebreaking vote, you could accurately blame Trump for losing Republicans, the Senate, by jumping in and endorsing Oz rather than McCormick or staying out of it altogether."
"So not completely worthless, but still good."
"Of course, also worth noting, there's also a very high profile Senate race in this state, too."

 Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris were back in campaigning in the battleground states Thursday.
So we really appreciate you joining us.
"I mean, she's got years of government experience, far more than Donald Trump."
So already you're probably a 264.
It's not as important in the eastern part of the state where you were in Philadelphia because they don't frack.
She's doing really well in terms of endorsements from organizations that never endorse presidential candidates.
And my apologies if I've said his name incorrectly.
"When Shapiro was speaking, one of the most significant topics that he brought up was the significance of having direct touch with people, particularly through trade unions and other labor groups."
And the margin in the state's lower chamber is a single seat.
The eventual winner of these states could very well determine who sits in the White House come January 2025.
"So tell me, what's it like A, to be home?"
"So anytime you can see a decrease of around 15%, it is good."

That's the name of the video.
Let's take a look at that.
Clinton was up by six.
Think about what's been happened to Trump.
So he's making a strong case for himself.
They're anxious.
And he was laying down on a roof that wasn't even that far from the venue.
They're threatened constantly.
It's so funny.
They're still saying the story is fake.
Brave.
"And sometimes I didn't live up to those values and I made mistakes, and I tried to learn from them."
"If you got in, would you probably just be smiling the whole time?"
So I guess I could lean towards yes on that.

There was plenty of security around at the at this at the rally.
 What Josh Shapiro brings to Pennsylvania is that he loves what he's doing and he has a passion and it's a ministry.
"Oh yeah, and then this is like a good representation."
"And with the recent polls, you know, there were some bad Republican internal polls last night that came out."

Apprehensive.
"Then in a very weird and creepy moment, Donald Trump talks about Corey Competore's wife, Corey Competore, was killed in Butler, Pennsylvania in the shooting, and Donald Trump is surprised that Corey Competore's widow says that she like still loves him and would still want to be with him."
They fund Hamas.

"And these supporters, they've been calling for a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas."
"Technically, you don't own your house either because eminent domain suggests that the US can just take it back whenever."
I need to sit in those stands.

"The fire started on one gondola, which then spread to a second one."
He did reflect on the assassination attempt itself.
"Now, you mentioned that this poll doesn't bring a lot of clarity."

And then it's R plus 5.8.
"So that is possible, possible to see that impact as well."
"You know this story, Guillermo?"
"Nevertheless, farmers are no strangers to the risk and the gamble that they take every single day in order to do what they know and love and that is to farm their land."
The hears his campaign is calling Trump's positions unpopular and damaging.
"And the bottom line is, if Kamala Harris loses in the state of Pennsylvania, and that is the tipping point state, as Mr. Berman put it, the state that put Donald Trump over the top in the electoral college, there are gonna be some real questions as to whether Kamala Harris should have chosen Josh Shapiro given how popular he is in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
And the guy that Casey's up against is like a bottomless pit of special interest money.
"But now that Kamala is there, everything she's done has been really well scripted."
She's my jackpot.
"Look at 2024 Republicans went down by roughly 50,000 votes."

West 71 was fighting to get his name added to the candidate roster in the battleground state before Pennsylvania begins early voting and mail-in voting in the coming weeks.
So I feel like everybody's equal in that right.
"I mean, nobody cares about what Donald Trump is saying."
"Obviously Democrats have way more mail-in ballots just in general in 2020, 878 K Republicans were at 305 K Republicans have gone down by almost 7% so you can see there's still, they've gone down by about 22 K in terms of mail-in ballot requests as opposed to Democrats well over a hundred K almost like 130 K total in terms of that."
Anything at all?
"No, definitely not."
"He stood on stage, kind of bopping and dancing."
We know it's a red herring.
That's on private land.
I don't see anybody afraid.
Between the people in real life that are going to be gullible enough to believe that this is some sort of ploy about the radical left to eliminate Donald Trump because he's the savior and the people online that are using him as a hype machine because he has so much aura and this pic goes so hard.
This is not a problem.

Now these counties here will report in earlier than Philadelphia because there are fewer people here than there are in Philadelphia and the thing to note is of all of these votes here in Allegheny in 2020 almost 65% of them went for Biden in this whole section here including Philadelphia it was about 66% of all the votes from this area went for Biden but in Philadelphia which is included in this number of the 66% but if you take this out and just look at Philadelphia 80% of the votes coming out of Philadelphia went to Biden and so when you look at 43% of all of the votes cast in Pennsylvania are coming from these two areas and that roughly 65% of all of those votes went to Biden it means that the state goes to the Democrat it's just the way that the numbers work out especially if there is a significant increase in the number of people voting in this area especially in Philadelphia and also over here in Allegheny which we expect to have happened in this election so come November when you're watching the election returns you are going to relax take a deep breath get out your popcorn and whatever adult beverages you might be consuming that night and you will just sit and watch the returns coming in from Pennsylvania and you will not care what is happening for the whole state of Pennsylvania until the Philadelphia metropolitan area starts reporting in and Allegheny County because between those two areas that is 40 it's going to be 43% of the vote and in fact I would say with the increase in voter participation for this particular election it could be anywhere from 45 46 48 percent of the entire vote coming out of those two areas and because the majority of the voters are voting for the Democrat this is why I predict Kamala Harris is taking Pennsylvania in this election it's just about the math
The child star.
"Reg, wouldn't you expect to see the governor there?"
You heard Ruben speak a little bit about his life.
"With its diverse electorate, Pennsylvania remains a microcosm of the broader national political landscape."
"It's quite the divide, 50 to 34 percent."
"When we start opening up these laws to say this many weeks or this or that or this exception or that exception, it's never ending."
"Yeah, we've even seen President Biden sort of attacking Donald Trump in the past couple of days for the misinformation that's being spread with this hurricane."
And I think that is the most catastrophic thing come November.
"Around 2 o'clock, Air Force 2 landed here in Johnstown."
Y'all see I did a video yesterday about how they needed a Kamala needed a homeless people Homeless people to support her.
"And prices, you know, that has been a huge, huge factor, right?"
"Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
But I think today was a step in the right direction.
ABC's congressional correspondent Rachel Scott is at the midterm monitor with more.
"You know, maybe North Carolina is like that."
And then I was saying this to Chris Stierwald.
Do you believe your vote can make a difference?
"When Marist polled other states, Harris is having a five-point lead over Trump in Michigan, and I believe only a 1% lead in Wisconsin, but with Pennsylvania, it's really coming down to the wire here."
"We're gonna discount Rasmussen, not because I think he should discount Rasmussen, but everyone says, Rasmussen's a Republican leaning poll."
Juicy.
"Now, of course, he is not the president, doesn't have any control over the military right now, but it is this kind of heightened rhetoric that we're seeing in the closing weeks of the campaign."
This is Coattow and thanks for watching.
Don't wait.
"A lot of toss up states, really interesting numbers."
You're going to be in trouble.
It so happens that I live about eight minutes away from Reading.
Now Democrats appear to be flipping the script on the 78 year old convicted felon who could be the oldest president to be elected to the White House if in fact he wins in November.
I was on the ground in Pennsylvania covering this for the primary.
Here are the top stories making the headlines to the North American region.
"It was like under 10,000 people."
The signs don't point away.
Unfortunately someone did lose their life they did get hit in the rally another person was critically injured and the shooter we don't know who it is but according to the Secret Service he's been neutralized.
Let's say a new poll says at 52 percent.
"But you look at the data, you realize these are not just Democrats."
"Again, I'm not saying that's going to that's not going to change."
"And when Joe Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020, he won it by a pretty dowdy margin."
So I understand people feeling frustrated and feeling we can do better.
I think maybe she should be partaking in lithium because Donald Trump should be forced to live on an island with all these people.
Can you explain how you're going to pay for those?
"Are there any indicators, anything that you can look at that might perhaps read the tea leaves a little bit more when you really take a deep dive into the numbers?"
Then she has the slight advantage.
He's not going to die.
And that's part of the problem with Donald Trump.
Donald Trump has been convicted of a felony.
Are you happy with that answer?
"Well, look, the latest NBC News poll, it shows that 18 percent of voters say protecting democracy would be so important they would vote for or against the candidates solely on that basis, Denver."
"Well, I think you can I think you could sum it up in one word and that is real."
"If she loses Pennsylvania, she can't win."
And we have to usher in a new era to bring about just solutions to these decades long conflicts without.
"Thanks to John McCain, he didn't do it."
"Of all the questions that Brett followed up on, the one you showed, several others of trans, gender surgery, et cetera, she never did answer."
"And then apologies, but I'm going to add a second question onto that as well, because we're close to running out of time."
"And I'm talking about people on both sides, the one saying, oh the shooter missed, he only had one job and then you have other people saying, well look at his pose after he got shot."
"And he's also heightened his rhetoric when it comes to immigration over the weekend, calling America, quote, occupied, calling the town of Aurora, Colorado conquered by Venezuelan gangs."
"Hit subscribe, let's get to three million subscribers together, thank you so much for watching."
"This is the third time he's running No, we just got our citizenship here in America."
More J6.
The child star comet or whatever and there is a comet in the sky now that can be seen.
"However, the United States of America does allow guns, not of course, in presidential rallies."
"This is our last week's number, but the new one's going to be the exact same thing."
"Turnout's going to drop across the board, but will it drop more on the left than on the right?"
"Even though wages are steadily growing, even though inflation is finally slowing, the price of everything, from health care to housing to groceries, it's still too high and it hurts."
"It mixes up the board a little bit in a very healthy way, right?"
"So I'm going to go and I'm with that being said, hello."
"On Wednesday, the largest crowd of the campaign showed up in Detroit, Michigan."
"And of course, if you're supporting candidates who are running for election in primaries, and then again, more importantly, in the general election in the fall, you want to alienate as few voters as possible."
"One of the conversations surrounding this is about how people are just like black people specifically are having the conversation of how they are happy that the person, the shooter is not a black person because we wouldn't have been able to hear the end of it if we happen to be a black person."
I've never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate ever.
This is where the majority of the votes are.
The most recent poll for the New York Times shows Harris is closing in on Donald Trump in a number of swing states.
"Under the Biden-Harris administration, we're producing more domestic energy than ever before in this nation, which strengthens our economy and it strengthens our national security."
"This whole thing, it reminds us to think bigger."
"And in a state that was super close in 2020, and you're not seeing this male in the Philadelphia area at the same rate you saw last time, she's in an uphill climb in the state."
The twelfth poll was conducted between September 19th and 25 by morning consult with 993 registered voters.
And that is something that the culinary workers union and other groups that represent service workers across the country has been saying should be raised because it's unfair to these tipped hourly wage workers to not be at least hitting the $7.25 federal minimum wage and then whatever they make in tips.
And now the most recent surveys from September and October indicate that Harris leads Trump at forty seven to forty one percent among the suburban voters.
"Good job, Grandma."
"And then we can see Patriot polling, another one, Trump plus one."
The Harris team is flip-flopping.
" Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are getting some real early voting data this time out of Pennsylvania, Donald Trump flipping a very important county."
It's things like the border.
You think they liked him the whole time?
"Tim Ryan was one of the few who challenged Nancy Pelosi, J.D."
"And it really begs the question, if they can't get Philadelphia on board, what are their chances in the rest of the state?"
Jessica.
"And if rounding up and deporting millions of desperate people, many of them women and children, is the answer to everything."
"So now with his numbers, you would think it would be even easier in 2024."
Trump won by eight.
On you.
Does she need to do a bit of a better job selling her vision for the economy?
And that's why the votes changed that much.
"Yeah, Pennsylvania."
Same thing.
"I know, I don't even want to give them tips."
"Trump addressed the incident directly, expressing gratitude for his survival and his ability to continue speaking to his supporters, emphasizing the importance of resilience and determination in the face of adversity."
"But Kamala Harris, you're probably not going to see it."
"Libby Cathy, for us, always excellent reporting and analysis."
"Look, it's getting old when firefighters booed JD Vance, when a whole lot of folks realize the empty promises Donald Trump made back in 2015, 2016 never followed through on during his four years in the White House."
I also wanted to take a moment out and read the statement that Trump made on Twitter.
Vance also took the stage in Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania's time to stand up for America and time to save our country.
"I mean, I mean that happened."
That's a huge misstep.
Let's just hear some music.
"Harris could win every other state, which this map's not going to happen, but in this scenario, Trump's is victorious."
"They just want to gaslight all of us and say, it's not happening."
He's got his gold sneakers.
They get it posthumously.
So what will President Trump be doing during the DNC?
It's a state that's definitely in play.
 The closer look at the race for 2024 and joining us are ABC White House correspondent Mary Alice Parks from Pennsylvania and NPR White House correspondent and ABC News contributor Usma Khalid from Washington.
"And my son said, that's not a long distance, 100."
I can't wait to see how it is here.
"In the seventh poll, from August 6th to 9th, which was also conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, with different with 693 registered voters, Harris received 45% of the vote, while Trump received 43%."
Kamala Harris received 51 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 46 percent.
But isn't that message getting through to undecided voters concerned about the economy?
"And you and I have talked about sexism before, which is certainly alive and well in lots of worlds, including politics."
And I don't really think she puts a lot at risk there because of the way the campaign's been trending.
"Raymond, pleasure to meet you."
It's never about turning Somerset red.
Thank you again for your service There's something particular about Trump that excites you as a voter Bringing everything back to the states as far as fueling I drive trucks for work and everything and our prices skyrocketed for fueling trucks specifically Having the Keystone pipelining ago is huge for me Working in the trades.
"They have all, has your town changed slightly?"
"Our votes are our voice, and that's how we can win."
"Is there anything to stand up there and say, I'm proud of X, Y, and Z because I think for the world even he's become a laughing stock when it comes to our foreign policy."
And it was an indication of where it was.
And then we have the lies that Trump and his crack team of wing nuts have been spreading.
"In this sample, he's a little bit up."
I think so.
"Martha Green â€“ $1,000,000 Martha Green, an heir to a Pennsylvania steel dynasty, has long been a supporter of progressive causes."
They have buzzwords like joy.
"And these numbers, by the way, they're actually out of date a little bit."
"And yet, a lot of the response to it from his supporters was to just agree and not really bad an eye about it."
"But I for a long time now, it's felt like of the three rust belt states, the most likely one to go to Trump would probably be Pennsylvania."
I do not like to hear.
Rural voters in Pennsylvania have been a key part of Trump's coalition.
"But Burgos who chairs the Latinos con Harris, which I think is gendered."
"When you look at this, he could very well flip a county like Lackawanna County, which is where Scranton is."
I know what it means for an individual and a family to have home ownership.
So it's kind of pushed those folks over to Harris.
Republicans should 100% go there because it exposes the fact that the Democrats do not want any election integrity and it's all gaslighting.
We just want to clear it up.
Trump is doing a rally in Pennsylvania tonight.
Again the Democrats are normally the organized ones.
"In swing Northampton County, Pennsylvania, Democratic volunteers meet weekly to strategize, before hitting the streets and pushing every way they can for Harris."
"Yeah, we know that over the last four years, about 10 to 15,000 Haitian immigrants have moved to this town in Springfield, Ohio."
"Barack Obama wanted to gather more support for Vice President Kamala Harris, but he's managed to do the opposite."
"In fact, it's the opposite."
You'll see it's without of the margin of error.
"Last night, Kamala Harris had a rally at like a preschool gym."
I also want to share this particular one because it's not only funny people who are getting some stuff off of their chest and how to be very careful during this particular period.
"Everyone, let's thank President Trump."
"This poll goes over three different states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin."
That's just crazy.
That makes a lot of sense.
And that's something that she's particularly under pressure to do right now.
"Democrats gained only 5,000."
The president's birthplace said the report would change their plans to vote for Biden a second time.
They're signing up for shifts to make calls and send texts and knock on doors.
"You know, it's great to be out here in the atmosphere."
It's Pennsylvania.
"Yeah, family influence."
"Yeah, well, listen, a part of it is having a conversation."
It's opposite.
"It's like, no, clearly he's not."
It was a strategic move to energize voters in a state known for its political significance.
"A beautiful town of Asheville, North Carolina, one of my favorite places in the country."
This is what he had to say in Detroit.
They've moved right.
And it is scheduled to open up in those affected counties in North Carolina as well as certain parts of Georgia.
Where was Scott Perry?
"Arizona and Georgia, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, you win those three states and Trump's got over a 65% chance."
I can't remember what it was.
Let's send President Trump back to the White House.
Mexico didn't pay for a wall.
That feels good.
"Some weird stuff, Senator, what do you when you see that?"
So this is really important to note here.
And ideally we could just say Donald Trump has taken the average right now.
"And listen, I recognize family values is something that is kind of individually defined by a lot of people."
"Our politicians are supposed to be able to address the public in a safe environment and that is why there is so so much security, the security that you've described, people being wandered down, having their backs checked just to get into that area and you know we understand why tensions are so high, why people are so emotional there."
"So what would a the question is, I'm going to bring it up again."
Just huge.
"And I guess the answer is till it's not, right?"
"Moving forward to the sixth poll, also conducted by Spry Strategies on the same dates with a different 600 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 45%."
"Frankly, I'm going to say this in all sincerity."
How can I make the most money?
The economy.
And does that line up with what Obama was telling those campaign workers?
It's clear it's very close there.
They should be something to celebrate.
Bloomb farm zoning permit status.
"Yeah, even though I've walked through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil because I'm the biggest, baddest, meanest person in the valley."
We haven't had a strong leader in a very long time.
"So if Harris is winning Pennsylvania, there's a good chance of the bare minimum she's up in Michigan, where at that point, yeah, she just needs one more state."
But this is what we're going to go ahead and do.
And you said it well.
"Look, there's been good economic data recently, right?"
"Julie, this is fantastic that you were able to speak with both candidates."
"I'm not finished, exactly."
"We are all charged with a nonpartisan, non-candidate mantra to engage in public policy, voter registration, education, engagement, and mobilization."
Landslot and then you'd be hitting me up.
"Former President Bill Clinton, the last Democrat before Joe Biden to flip that state blue campaign in the Peach State for Kamala Harris yesterday."
It's very personal to me.
Chase.
We've had a historic pandemic that wreaked havoc on communities and businesses.
"Well, there's a lot of trash candidates in this race."
"But today in Georgia, the Trump campaign, definitely hoping he stays on message trying to court those suburban women voters."
"They said it is so much better to be for for something rather than against something to be for the future, not going back."
But just be fair for the most part.
That's not how we should approach politics and I'm gonna explain why.
It's really hard to say what's really happening here.
One president saying it was due to hostilities of political partisanship.
Obviously she couldn't do that prior to her becoming the nominee or before Biden had dropped out of me not becoming the nominee.
So more people are just going to go in person.
"But what we know, based on data points, even before she announced Tim Wallace as the VP, and I do think he adds a lot, especially being from the Midwest, an election winner of 2020 and 2022 rather in 2018, he does well in the state, is that Pennsylvania, right now I have as a lean Democratic state, I do believe Kamala Harris and Tim Wallace can win it."
All three of those names have been in the conversation really since the start.
"Everyone's laughing like he's being tongue in cheek, but Trump genuinely started a new crypto business spearheaded by his two sons, Beavis and Butthead."
"If we swamp them, we will win."
She finished about two points up.
"And showing again the importance that they're placing on Pennsylvania, which will be crucial for both candidates to win if they want to get to 270 electoral college votes later this fall."
"I mean, it's just the facts, you know, so are you a Marine?"
"I think he just needs to get out, talk about what his record is and talk about the vision he has for America."
She was at the Johnstown airport today for the arrival of Vice President Harris Bailey.
"Take a look, new video coming in from our crew inside the Greensboro Coliseum."
"And yeah, that's the type of president we need."
And then there you have a guy who will just lie about it to score political points.
They had a Trump plus four.
" This I also like just from a rhetorical standpoint, part of like, I think the response that you're talking about in terms of like the press and the way that they're addressing her economic proposals and we should say like, you know, from what we know, at least in the speeches and we'll be playing this David Dayne interview tomorrow and he said that during her speeches, she's still bringing up the 5% rent control, national rent increase cap."
And then we also do have another thing that I want to talk about.
That was very clear in those sound bites.
Can you just explain what you got going on here and who you are?
"When you look across the board and we did some polling, in our Bloomberg poll, looking at all of the expanded child tax credits, the down payment assistance, all of these different policies, they are widely popular no matter which candidate they're coming from."
I'm the best one.
"Republican strategist Matt Clink, thank you so much for joining us tonight."
I believe that was the government's Basically They were admitting that he was on sound unfit and not of the right mind to rule this country But that took away the vote of all of those Democrats to put a candidate and therefore president that they liked.
"I mean, they're seeing on they're talking about this."
Russell's donation is not only a reflection of her wealth but also of her belief in Harris' vision for a more just and equitable America.
"Well two things first is we are flooded with disinformation like never before and I think it's imperative for everybody Penn students especially to To guard against being swept away by lies and stuff that is just meant to sort of pollute the atmosphere pollute the media ecosystem and You know look at the fact-checking websites for which there are three or four including factcheck.org here at Penn and PolitiFact Dot-com is another one, but that's one of the things that everybody needs to guard against to be good citizens But the second thing is that there is still time if you haven't done it to register to vote in Pennsylvania as opposed to where your parents live For example, this is just as we started this conversation."
"You had Adam Kinzenberry, you had Liz Cheney, you had Charlie Dent, who represents the Valley."
"That's a lot of fake news back there, too."
I know.
She's not going to give an interview.
"Tim Walz is popular, but so is she."
That's right.
Next Rasmussen had an LV poll in mid August which had Trump narrowly leading Harris 47-46.
"I mean, if we just take a pause, it's scary."
What about vice president Harris?
"Look, Democrats aren't held accountable for anything they say or do."
That's Democrats.
"As you may know, Congressman was at that Trump rally in Butler, P.A."
"It is not the concert, not sending out celebrities to do the work that canvassers paid canvassers from those communities should do."
"So they're a big part of this industry, especially in the southwest part of the state and rural areas where the energy industry is employing a lot of people."
And as President Kamala will never stop working to limit out-of-pocket costs and protect your care.
"So obviously, the candidates think it's an important issue."
It's not like he's leading it just in Trafalgar or Rasmussen or like insider advantage with some right leading pollster that ended up being wrong in 2022.
"You know, like I said, you can't take a camera into that."
"And I thought that was a crazy idea, but he did it."
Immigration is another hot-button issue.
Does this sound familiar as we have this trend that we've been talking about through all of these primaries?
It will be close.
"Let's remember when it comes to October surprises, understand this with the Trump October surprise."
"If you will recall, Donald Trump won all the electoral votes in Pennsylvania in the 2016 US presidential elections by a margin of 0.72 percent."
That's what you have to deal with when you're looking at this endorsement.
"They need people on the ground who get it, who can connect with those voters authentically."
Beautiful hat right there.
"And Pennsylvania alongside many other battleground states has seen quite significant shifts in favor of the Democratic contender now, Kamala Harris."
Based on the shifts in these polls it appears that neither candidate has any discernible momentum but let's get into it for Pennsylvania.
"Well, from one end of the state to the other, KDK and our sister station CBS News Philadelphia are teaming up today to listen to you and take the pulse of Pennsylvania voters."
"I don't wish death on anybody at all, right?"
Where are you from?
"And with the latest poll numbers that we see out of Northeast Pennsylvania, if Kamala Harris is able to get over 40 percent, chances are they're going to win the state."
"When you think about Secretaries of State, the role, you tend to think that it respectfully is a boring job, a mundane job, an administrative job."
There's quite a bit of wealth that is there.
"Yeah, I see."
"Obviously, Secret Service is the lead agency."
I think I don't know how to understand those folks.
"Engaging with constituents, addressing their concerns, and promoting clear, actionable plans will be vital in securing voter support.In conclusion, the upcoming elections will not only be a test of the candidate's appeal, but also a reflection of the priorities and values of voters across these crucial states."
"We don't know 18 year old Jamel Garcia, a student at the Brothers Barber shop, says he'll vote for the first time."
He's going to be back.
"However, the salt cap is a big issue in New York, New Jersey, California, house districts that matter."
"No, these are new voters."
So expect those tensions to still be there if Trump is elected but it's certainly a conference much more aligned with his economic message than what we had in a first Trump term.
I did put in some ads.
He saved me.
"But Pennsylvania, you know, those key places, they kind of show signs of moving to the right."
"He is on his way, I believe, to the hospital."
"Now, we know this election is going to be tight."
We saw him kind of live there in 2020.
We have nothing to do with this.
We talked to a lot of people.
"You know, um, it shouldn't have happened."
Every vote counts though.
"He suggested that the Democrats' strategy of portraying Trump as, weird, could be effective, emphasizing the need to use irony and satire to highlight Trump's perceived absurdities."
So his ceiling is probably somewhere around 49 is probably his like absolute ceiling.
It is illegal in the entire United States to conduct a post-birth abortion.
Yeah I think that in summary it's been interesting to look at.
"And you see Trump's in-door seat, Mark Burns."
"Maybe obviously the polls would say, well, actually, I'm not even sure."
But here's what I want to talk about.
"So we're at the DNC right now, as you can tell, right?"
"And basically, at his whim, and he's looking at anywhere from 20 percent up to 60 percent of tariffs."
"But then again, we like to follow the book."
"And the other guy, the astronaut, he's okay too, but I'm going with Shapiro."
Let's see what we'll give it.
Turn it up.
Now you have Kamala Harris versus Trump.
"The filmmakers follow a formula, so there are some predictability factors, but they know how to tell a scary story that will make you, well, scream."
So it's not just ancestral Democrats.
You a lot Look at all these people.
A 16 point advantage enough so that Pennsylvania went from being likely red to lean red to tilt red to toss up and now lean blue.
"So the question is, why didn't he actually solve the problem when he was in power?"
"So when we talk about it, Governor Shapiro out campaigning for the vice president today, there's Shapiro as we know, he's on the short list to become her running mate."
"And Axios kind of summing up the polling trends of recent, Axios put it this way this morning, which I loved kind of speaking to all American voters."
Why are they such an important voting block for both sides?
"You only win the state by 80, 90 K. It's not an apples to apples comparison, but it still does make sense that if they had such a bigger voter registration advantage and they were only able to win the state by like a point now imagine considering how much it's condensed."
"Because if you win it, you're probably gonna win the presidency."
"But again, CNN is done with her garbage."
We encourage our audience to engage with the electoral process actively.
"So yeah, let me go ahead and just tune into that for a little bit, your heart, you know what I'm saying?"
"Yeah, and President Biden, as you know, he often touts his humble Pennsylvania roots from Scranton."
And you'll see him again and again.
"But the other thing she said, I'll switch over to the animation that we made about that."
I think he's a good guy.
"Meanwhile, the top VP, finally, Shapiro, has been met with the most scrutiny to include his mishandling of a 2011 Philadelphia teacher stabbed to death in her apartment, a sexual harassment complaint made against one of his former cabinet members and his stance on the Middle East."
They favored Biden.
I'm Doug in exile.
It's clear that Pennsylvania is a key state for both candidates and they are pulling out all the stops.
"If they can prevent the Trump campaign from flipping Georgia and hold on to their blue wall in the upper Midwest, that's gonna be the ball game for them."
We're a great nation.
"But if you don't put Trump in, you're not going to have any energy jobs in here."
And sometimes I didn't live up to those values and I made mistakes.
It's a new time.
"But fine, voter registration, it's not everything."
"And for our viewers, let's show you the full exchange right here on Live Now from Fox."
"Alright, now to give us more perspective in terms of what of course is happening in the American elections, we're being joined by Ms. Joanna LeBlanc, who is a political analyst and a foreign relations expert."
"And look, even though your grocery prices are improving, gas is going down slowly."
Everybody has their own biases.
"Watch his fins flap, and his large round mouth move in and out."
"Yeah, John, that's the way to phrase it to the American people."
"It's good news, but you really want to be up by three, four because then you're starting to get outside of the margin of error."
Well this really feels a lot like a festival of sorts you can see the crowd behind me but what you can't see right now is the crowd that extends far beyond our press riser really essentially covered in people I would say tens of thousands of people are here and some from across the country we spoke to someone yesterday who drove an RV all the way from Los Angeles to be here in Butler.
I think there might be.
"That's because, whereas the right to an abortion is effectively enshrined in state law in both Michigan and Pennsylvania, it is still in flux in Wisconsin."
"During a rally in Flint, Harris highlighted her plans for what she called an opportunity economy and vowed to put middle-class working families first."
I have a concept of a plan to do the dishes.
And so I was able to delegate her responsibility on everything from foreign policy to domestic policy.
"In contrast, Trump has focused on reducing government regulation and repealing parts of the Affordable Care Act, which has resonated with voters who prioritize limited government involvement in health care."
"Don't just sort of accept the fact that the president of the group, you know, endorsed you."
Yeah we'll see.
"And listen, these are just, you know, these are just the polls."
There's a handful of them.
"Pennsylvania has been back and forth for the last few days, a few weeks now."
"I want a VP pick that's secure enough to be second under a woman, is content to be VP, and won't undermine the president to maneuver his own election, and doesn't sweep sexual harassment under the rug."

"He has to win Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania."
"In 2019, I believe, at a town hall, you said you were asked, would you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on your first day in office?"
"But if Barack Obama did last week, that was the last straw with a lot of people."
"People like me, forget it."
Election comes down to Pennsylvania.
They go around to Trump rallies to interview the people there.
Mary Ann Williamson continuing to dump on Trump because of the eating cats issue will create blowback on November 5th.
"And because Pennsylvania is a smaller version of America, you know, that's in terms of the urban and rural and suburban."
Donald Trump and the Republican Party's strategy.
"Yeah, maybe there could be something to that."
Look at this on the first day of the request.
"Biden Harris is a benefit of the ingenuity of the private sector, their own incompetence notwithstanding."
So there's no.
"And that is substantial because Kamala Harris being ahead in Pennsylvania goes to show that her level of electability really boils down to the Sunbelt and the Rust Belt, the exact two regions that Kamala Harris was needed the most."
"I mean, possibly because I was in literally in the suburbs, so maybe that's why the targeting was there, but it seemed to me like that, I took note of the fact that it was so strong, so unified in that message from both of those candidates, from the Senate candidates, as well as the presidential candidates that clearly they've got a lot of internals, this is the main thing to go all in on."
He likes to talk about Kamala being vice president for years.
 Welcome back.
"And this, by the way, is terrible news for Kamala Harris."
"I grew up in a coal mining community not far from here and it's sad to see the state of a lot of those places but with the oil and gas they established a new tax structure in Pennsylvania to where a lot of the money is diverted back to the local communities, the counties."
What is the Trump rationale here?
Every word out of her mouth was like the F word.
"And then in addition to that, you also have some rulings that impact how ballots will be addressed and how election night will be handled here in Georgia."
"Although as you point out, Nnedi, 80 percent of black men do support the vice presidents."
Your reaction to Trump's messaging.
Never mind.
Everybody contributes in the way that they do.
There's no way around it.
It's 5050.
"This state is very, very important."
So yes for the greater good I am all for what just happened on that stage because we have to think of this shit.
The election results the last couple of times have been really close.
I'm the father of IVF.
Why does the former president still remain such a formidable force in the GOP?
A sample size large enough.
Today's rally comes as calls from Democrats asking President Biden to step down grow.
And I think more people want elected officials who understand the day to day needs of working class Americans.
"Jabari Michael Kensu, a Kappa Alpha Psi alum chapter member and a pit graduate, echoed her sentiment."
"Why don't we just take out the sensitive and put it in um, and then it'll be Trump property."
He believes that he is running for office to serve the people.
Let's have some real talk here.
She was defensive.
"It's because people, because of how bad inflation is, they're telling on their themselves, their own arguments are counterproductive."
The polls are fake.
And that's probably the number one issue in every single state across the union.
They've been giving us the Green New Deal.
61% were graduates.
See website for details and important safety information.
"Closing out to the Southeast region now, let's head up to the Commonwealth of Virginia."
What really troubles me about that is J.D.
You just.
"He's roughly tied among middle age voters, but maybe there's some regional up and downs and whatever."
He's outside of Pittsburgh.
Does he really get into the nuts and bolts of what exactly he would do in terms of the economy?
Even Pittsburgh.
What do these numbers say?
And Donald Trump was heavily criticized by conducting diplomacy with Vladimir Putin and little rocket man in North Korea.
Shots have been fired at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania.
I wouldn't let it happen.
You made it.
So that is the group that Harris and Wall's and Trump and Vance are both courting here in western Pennsylvania it's really a message focused on the economy.
"Okay, that's true."
"ZACH HUDAK, CNN News Reporter, CBS News There's no question both these campaigns view Pennsylvania as nearly a must-win state."
His messaging may focus on tax policies and regulatory changes that aim to boost job growth and economic stability in these sectors.
And what I did was front load the columns here that talk about what news people watch.
Inspired by a true story of a Brazilian fisherman who rescues a lost penguin named Din Din from an oil spill.
"Autocrats begin by vilifying the press, demonizing their and dehumanizing their opponents and co-opting the judiciary."
"So falloffs were expected, but obviously this is the comparison Republican versus Democrat."
So we went and something amazing happened as we got closer to the rally to meet the group.
Folks are standing there not sure what's happening.
"Really what's important is somebody that can articulate their ideas, listen, respond well."
But let's just look.
I think there's been an increased focus on young voters in this cycle.
There are police reports on it.
That's why we hold office.
Name that name that sound.
What he has said and what he will do is return us to a time when young black men are walled off from opportunity.
We have to listen to what he says.
And that is why Trump's going on these podcasts.
I get I know everything Everything I know every time I'm different.
"This can be particularly effective in debates, where Trump can highlight the ruling as a success for his campaign and as evidence of his commitment to secure elections."
I chalk it up to a state level apparatus.
And Donald Trump just started to ask for music to be played instead and then he danced.
I am such a PC.
"Donald Trump struggles with nearly all of those groups of voters, and in 2016, he was able to win over voters with a populist message, right?"
"Hmm, that's fascinating."
This could be an electoral blowout with Harris winning a significant amount of beyond 270 electoral votes nationwide.
"It gets into bigger questions like how we see age and perception in politics, especially this close to an election."
"Dan Barker, 71, is a former judge and member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."
They need a real plan and they need to execute it flawlessly and they need to do it fast.
We know about what's happening to our girls.
"All right, now a poll this week by a bipartisan group found that Harris's lead over Trump is 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent."
"No, they got the generic vote just the generic ballot vote off by like point five."
"We can take a look, for example, at Michigan's race for for Gretchen Whitmer."
"I am Brandon Finnegan, co-founder of Decision Desk HQ."
The the the donors to this super pack want the Republican agenda.
The question is deployed very strategically by the right in this country.
What is unclear from the footage is whether the injury to Donald Trump was caused by gunfire or whether it was caused by him falling to the floor.
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 47% each.
"The strongholds, Chris Cox."
But what are you hearing about his plans today?
"If prescribed, your medication ships directly to you for free and in discreet packaging."
So it's really hard to say.
"Well, I think it's a good future."
This poll also had some insight into what voters are feeling just about Trump and Harris as candidates generally and their approval ratings.
So as you guys know in the debate There was a surprise name drop and that was actually of Polish people Polish Americans got a pretty surprise name drop They're not really mentioned for much Outside of I think like the sausage or something like that But they don't really get much mention and it's not a voter group that's really talked about very often but they got this big name drop and Kamala Harris is trying to sort of inject that because Polish people really don't like Poland and Polish people really really hate to Russia that puts them in a lot of Weird scenarios because a lot of times like Poland and stuff.
Sure.
"After what happened there with the assassination attempt, I knew I had to come, added Ryan Morris of New Haven, Connecticut."
Let's move them.
I'd like to be in the center of the universe and I'm just not sure where that is.
So have you guys been to other values?
So that was a very important statement for her to make.
"JD Vance was really just dog water in terms of the possibilities that he could have, you know, who he chose, and what ended up happening."
And even the New York Times could only pull a Harris plus one.
You've both been involved in politics for quite a while.
Every vote counts.
Love that.
A couple of different things here.
"It caught fire with Democrats, so he brought it back last night."
You know what that means?
The Georgia and DC cases likely aren't happening before the election either.
"No, no, no, I'm not."
"Everything you need to know about, how America votes, and its global implications."
"And I would put that, if not the top one in the nation, or certainly within the top five."
Did you have anything else to add?
"We're gonna be looking at why Kamala Harris is set to win the state of Pennsylvania in the electoral college, just like Joe Biden did and flipped it from being a Trump state in 2016."
"Of course, for people watching that haven't been there, a key caller County where Democrats have seen a lot of pickup from maybe Republicans who have had a lot of conversations about this taste for Trump."
Our Scott McFarland is there.
Got to earn every vote.
"We'll go to Muhlenberger first, because it's got a 6% margin of error, 450 votes here."
Because Michigan had been for some time fairly reliably blue.
"Simply put, no."
"So like I said, throw it in the average."
What happened?
Kamala Harris is making clear that she gets how to win Pennsylvania.
"And if they don't, you tell them he's got concepts of a plan and it don't make sense."
So we're not sure if any of these things are gonna move the metric really.
That's liberal stuff.
Subscribe and hit that notification bell if you want to be kept up to date with the latest political gaffes and news stories of Kamala Harris.
You're telling me that not a single person said that.
Black men took to social media to share their frustration.
"It can be misleading, especially in a state like Pennsylvania because well, there's a bunch of ancestral Democrats in the Commonwealth, especially in the western half of the state."
Does that feel like a conspiracy theory a little bit?
What exactly are we seeing here?
"Some of you know that when I was growing up, I didn't have a father in the house."
CBS News campaign reporter Zach Hudak joins me now from Washington.
"In the presidential election that will take place in 2024, he highlighted his state as a crucial battleground that will be contested."
"43.49 for Harris, not much different."
"What's really interesting, it's almost like someone realized banning fracking isn't the best idea when you need those Pennsylvania votes."
The electorate is more divided.
"In the words of our friend Amy Walter, the presidential contest has moved from one that was Trump's to lose to a much more competitive contest."
Thanks for being with us.
"Now, I should say I should say that there's a possibility, of course, but I just would find it so hard to believe that Democrats are down so much in early voting, not just, you know, row votes wise, which is bad enough."
But if you add all the Biden and Haley voters up together and you compare it to the Trump vote Donald Trump would technically win the state by 21 points based off of Trump and not Trump and that's giving all the Haley voters to Biden which is not entirely probably the way that it's going to go in November and you can extrapolate from this is the main point.
And so we're seeing a lot of that.
"You know, you take all you all plus one, a plus two, you get a few of them."
"Kamala Harris received 48% of the vote and Donald Trump, 51%."
So something could happen tonight.
Let's see what's going on there and what we could do for the Lord.
"Hey, folks, don't forget to hit the subscribe button and check out our daily show."
"Well, for example, just a couple of weeks ago in her plan to support small businesses, she talked about the investment climate that we need in order to help entrepreneurs start small businesses and grow."
Five predictions and analysis of potential outcomes.
"It's influencing their choices in the polls, and both candidates know it."
 There are people increasingly writing to me and they are mad at me.
But it's not just Kamala Harris that's getting smashed by media.
"Earlier this week, Loomer sharing a racist post about Harris, who's the child of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, suggesting if Harris wins, the White House will smell like curry, among other things."
This is where it's going to be won.
"Yeah, I saw Bernie speak earlier today, and he's still totally the same Bernie as he was before."
"Robert King â€“ $2 million Robert King, a media mogul with extensive holdings in Pennsylvania, has donated $2 million to Kamala Harris' campaign."
"A lot of people, friends, a lot of people."
"And as Harris gears up for her Fox News appearance, former President Trump intensifying his campaign efforts in key battleground states for their insights into the strategies of the two campaigns."
That was five days ago from the sitting president of the United States.
You got to show up and vote.
The one X factor that has happened that we've seen a sizable electoral reverberance with is the Dobbs decision.
"But the number one takeaway is not just Republicans didn't turnout, but where they actually did was Mahoning County, which is an ancestrally Democrat county in the district."
Yes!
Trump had a seven point polling lead in our average and now it's a tie.
"That's a pretty compelling stat, especially when you look at how our economy are unemployment into the historic low right now in America."
"This was a significant victory for Biden, given that Pennsylvania is his home state."
"NBC News reports today that as of right now, it's just short of a million."
"I mean, in recent elections, we have seen people turn out and vote with abortion on their minds, and that has very much benefited Democrats."
"Ugh, I thought it was rough in Arizona."
"No, but I would argue as of now, Donald Trump is the favorite in Pennsylvania."
And I think that is also why I am proud and I do have the support of the Steel Workers Union.
"Although I do believe the mail-in balloting, you know, things have changed in the last couple of years for processing, it's no longer COVID and all of that."
"Uh, there's so many situations out there, right?"
"You know, it's not outside stuff like that But still at the same time like, you know, that's it."
"If you if you get in team up with them and support them, they are serious about the work."
Every bit of support helps us keep you updated on the latest election news and insights.
It's too big to rig.
So you can see a lot of effort in that state for sure.
I've been involved with oil and gas for about 20 years.
He's a great guy.
"Well, that's her right."
He likes to talk about Kamala being Vice President for years.
"However in their poll just after the debate they got the same result, showing no gains for either candidate."
You look at where it's come from and where it's where it's going to go.
Let's get an idea of how big a crowd is.
"New York Times, a five point shift towards Trump."
That Donald Trump is a dangerous leader and that we should have reason to fear his return to the White House because we should take him at his word.
They make a fun of him dancing.
"Now, this product is not an official."
There's nowhere to export it to.
But maybe not as close as some people think.
And then here's how the Democrats are gonna manipulate the elders into voting.
Here's a live look from the Kamala Harris rally in Las Vegas.
"If you're a Republican, you should be 10,000 times angry at him."
"And y'all, let me also say this too."
"So whether this election is making you feel excited or scared or hopeful or frustrated or anything in between, do not sit back and hope for the best."
"Yeah, just by a point, not by five, not by six."
"Come and thumbs up this video, subscribe to the channel, hit the bell notification, hit all notifications so you have my videos in your possession each and every time I go live, I do upload."
I think it's the perfect ticket for that.
"They mentioned in the article that, you know, her numbers started to do better in the Rust Belt region after they chose Tim Walz as a nominee."
"Honestly, I think he's going to win it by around 20."
"They have much, they vote much later and closer to the election day."
"You can see In terms of you know, the the Pennsylvania numbers here, so It ends up being much closer than Wisconsin was the Wisconsin numbers are much nicer Do you have six is a bunch six is sevens, etc."
So our members vote on local candidates.
"There was so much around him, the assassination attempt, JD Vance announcement, the RNC had passed."
"It's definitely the, I think, driving force for why I'm going to go vote."
"Hey, this one, Charlemagne is perfect for the job."
I will work at peace before I'm even before.
"As a country, we've been through a lot over the last few years."
Donald Trump defeating Kamala Harris by three percentage points.
"If even if it's plus Dem plus two, Dem, that that would be good as well."
"And Anna, I gotta say one thing about what we're using."
And I'm sure she did laugh.
"That's why Pennsylvania, that's why everyone's spending so much money on the state."
The link is in the description and the pinned comment.
"And you can't really use the ancestral Democrat argument for registration data in Arizona the way you can in a place like Pennsylvania or even like North Carolina because of the fact that in the state of Arizona, it's a state that's moving to the left."
So that's a poll very favorable to Trump without question.
And I think she realizes that there are people that are going to come watch this.
They gathered a group of Latinos to talk about those issues.
Give me one reason you believe that.
You guys can check it out.
"We're looking at for current president, Joe Biden has a 54 percent disapproval rating."
I know Governor Shapiro has been on the road.
"So in case celebrations get crazy, they've removed light poles from campus, which quickly backfired because now fans are lighting stuff on fire just to see."
The Republicans are also mad at the Secret Service.
There's enough electoral map math there that makes it so that these states could truly be the ones that hand Kamala Harris the presidency.
We know exactly what he represents and what he would bring in the second term.
I was did a little bit of digging and I'm just going to show you really quickly a poll from back in 2020 where Quinnipiac was around this time.
This is a profoundly weird and disturbing movement.
You get some Texas burgers.
"So but the real poll is going to be in three weeks, right?"
So let's check this one out.
"A lot of people standing out in the hot, hot, hot, hot weather to get a glimpse of their president to hear their president speak to them directly in their hometown."
"Understanding this context is critical for any candidate aiming to connect with voters across the spectrum, particularly in regions that have experienced economic hardships."
I partied.
There's more Trump Vance.
You could even argue Wisconsin.
"I understand you don't speak for this group, but what does that mean?"
But I also have all the I have all the voting data for every county in the United States dating back to 1892.
"To be honest with you, I understand that politics get a lot of people enraged, but I don't think anybody deserves to lose their life at all, right?"
"Yes, I will."
She's talked to people from Pennsylvania.
Trumpy Trout is an animatronic talking fish with a big personality.
Are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead America?
"You know, I do a PG show."
You're a very popular governor and you're a Democratic governor in a state that is a pretty closely politically divided state.
"Specifically, when asked about her 9-11 conspiracy theories, he instead said that she is a supporter of his, who is a free spirit and a strong person."
This is this is the most important election in the history of our country.
"I think she's done that talking about investments in climate change, reducing fossil fuel emissions and investments across the board in our generation concerning student loans and housing affordability as well."
"He's not going to win Pennsylvania by 15 points, but."
It's a presidential year.
"I know what the kids are going through, she said."
"And I think if Biden was running for reelection, it would be gone because people have seen his policies."
"She's really emphasizing how critical this issue is, aiming to sway voters who might be on the fence."
"The top line numbers, the horse race numbers, look pretty good for Kamala Harris, but specifically on the economy, a remarkable turn here to find her essentially tied, certainly within the margin, with Donald Trump on the issue that will likely, for most voters, decide this election."
"One good example, one simple example is I feel like anyone can go shopping at any budget and you can collect a bunch of garbage even if you are poor."
She's the vice president of the United States and is helping President Biden navigate crises across the globe and here at home.
"And over the weekend, he talked about elite forces, National Guard, other things in our country being deployed to not only deport those suspected of or charged with or implicated in crimes, but others as well."
"We are going to be talking about three battleground state polls, one state in particular, Pennsylvania, that has seen the New York Times, Quinnipiac University, and Franklin and Marshall College in three consecutive days."
That's where all of the streams will take place.
I mean Parnell would have been far better than Oz.
"They were all so kind, so respectful and cordial."
Where are the other people that started screaming about Charleroi?
"If it wouldn't work for you, why should it work for the President of the United States?"
Really.
"The ninth poll was conducted between September 20th and 24 by Beacon Research, Shaw and Company Research among 1,021 registered voters."
Let's see what happened.
Let's see here.
They gave me like four cases of books as a result.
"It's just, I don't trust her."
Mm.
"I guess it's possible, but if this was just because of people using mail-in ballots less you would expect the drop to be even you know, 20% drop with Republicans roughly 20% with Democrats not Democrats are down 25% but Republicans are down like 12%."
I did do an interview with some of them.
A man was detained near the site of the former president's Saturday rally in Coachella Valley after law enforcement at a security checkpoint found guns in his car.
They will get him.
Dive into that world a little bit.
We got this massive surge.
"Because I don't think they've been enough for election security, even here in my own county, Fulton County, even though we're run by the Republicans."
"And now that he is facing pressure from the American people, he's doing what he's always done when he faced that pressure, which is he dodges, he ducks and he lies."
"Sadly, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania discusses the approaching election in 2024, the campaign strategy of Harris, and the importance of the state as a battleground in his speech."
You have to expand your message.
"Who specifically, which demographic is she trying to win over there?"
"And if you listen to his lies, it's like listening to Santa Claus."
Is that what motivates you?
"Senator, can you give us just a quick 30 seconds on efforts to undermine the voting process in the state of Pennsylvania?"
"I'm not exactly sure how he stacks up as a candidate now, compared to then he was much stronger in 2020 than he was in 2016."
Eleanor Desi will head to her ninth Democratic National Convention in just two weeks.
"Y'all see it definitely prayers to Trump always, you know prayers to Trump What are you going through?"
"You know, the same operation trying to collect ballots."
"The suburbs, particularly those around Philadelphia, have become the ultimate battlegrounds."
"And he spent a lot of time honoring the 50 year old former fire chief that died, Corey Comperatorre."
He has that background that can appeal and talk to voters from those segments of the population that want to hear from folks from that line of work.
"He's showing strength there with white working class voters, with older voters, with black men, with the Hispanics suburbs around Philly."
"But the other one is turnout, because there is an issue in which right now black voters are saying at an 83 percent rate that they're going to turn out, that they're definitely going to turn out or that they already have some cast balance by mail."
"Inside Advantage, Emerson, even Trafalgar and CBS News."
The debate is scheduled for September on ABC News.
I want to tell you what I'm thinking.
"So I hope Elon Trump, RFK Jr. is going to be the dream team to make us healthy again, man."
I still think there's going to be a polling error one way or the other and also there are late deciders which is a small number of the vote but it wouldn't shock me if as tight as everything is down the middle if one candidate ends up sweeping every single state because that's what can happen with three or four percent.
"So this time around, his campaign is hoping to increase support for him wherever possible."
Or will Trump make a last minute surge?
But there's never been spirit that we've seen like this.
"Biden's ratings are very, very low."
"He's probably gonna win the primary now, but I don't trust the guy."
And Bob Casey has a tough race as well.
He expressed his disapproval of this decision.
I've done multiple streams going over that poll.
"US reports that Vice President Kamala Harris is gaining significant traction in four pivotal Sun Belt states â€” Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada, and Georgia â€” where she is now neck-in-neck with former President Donald Trump."
"Oh, no question about it."
See who you think these people voted for.
"Bush says in years where it's a tight race, as we expect this year to be, the VP can be very important, especially ensuring up support from key voting blocks."
This was on ABC.
And what else do you think he brings to the ticket?
We need to get people out to vote for Donald Trump.
"His message of economic populism, combined with his stance on issues like immigration and trade, resonated strongly with these voters in 2016."
"My question to you is, what's your stance on reparations?"
"Yeah, what is a tape?"
We saw him reach up and touch his head.
"Because some people think the people, the rally goers, the attendees, the guests are crazy for showing up to a place where somebody tried to kill another person."
They've actually given him really good advice.
And maybe I'll do a separate video on that.
A lot of Republicans are criticizing Democrats saying to tone down the rhetoric.
"We can clearly see that the battle in Pennsylvania is extremely tight, because each candidate won polls with only one to two points of margin."
Of course and I believe him that he wants to repair this country because this country has been going through a lot in the negative way.
He would not let them take him off stage until he let the people know that he was going to be okay.
They're inner selves.
"But right now if the polling error is just a point in favor of Trump, he is winning Pennsylvania."
"In order to pursue a more divisive and Trump-centric agenda, he made the claim that Republicans were putting the problems that are most important to families on the backburner."
Kamala Harris was losing and Pennsylvania a week ago also had Kamala Harris.
You look weird doing that.
And that's what Donald Trump is going to do.
We need support over here and we're not really getting any.
"So again, you know, we're seeing some changes from last time around, but it's not yet clear how this is going to break down, even though some of these percentages are much bigger than four years ago."
Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote and Donald Trump 47%.
"And by the way, it also looks to be an even race for the United States Senate."
"Pretty much I like the way he, maybe not all the things he says, you know what I mean?"
"Well, yeah, I mean, inflation has been brutal."
She has an actual plan to make her life better.
"Harris is likely to win Philadelphia and some of those suburbs, and also Pittsburgh, perhaps, but the very far outer rings, that's where she's less likely to do well."
That's pretty much the election.
"And so I think given that we've seen a massive, massive shift relative to President Biden, we can also see this translated to a massive, massive shift on the national level as well."
First one.
"And this campaign is also, you know, shifted slightly in favor of Harris, but still neck and neck race."
It's not you all.
He made the Supreme Court in his image and remade much of the federal circuit as well.
And I don't feel like we got a lot of that.
"The music, nah, the music is crazy."
"They are so bad and frankly, they're evil."
I am here to tell you that is not what real strength is.
I hope they see jackpot and I hope they're entertained.
But they can't even supply what they have.
So that should tell you everything you need to know about David McCormick.
"His ramblings about Oprah Winfrey and other celebrities made headlines, but not for the reasons he might have hoped."
"So I do think all that social media attention does help, absolutely."
We were accepted with love.
Especially in Florida.
"In Ohio, he grew up, I believe, on the outskirts of Youngstown, trying to present himself as someone who is a more moderate centrist figure in tune with working people than perhaps is the image of other members of the Democratic Party."
"You can make an argument that well, it was the middle of the summer."
There's a lot of polls as well that have them tied and we have one outlier from morning compost that so delusionally believes that Harris is a got a similar lead in the state to what Obama had back in 2012.
He's got some intensity behind his campaign.
So we're going to wait a while.
"We are living in a time where evil is literally called good, and good is evil."
 Can we keep hearing about how this is a super tight race?
We always answer the call.
I'm not poor.
That three percent.
I think what we are trying to do and trying to understand is the center of America has moved on the issue of Israel and Palestine.
And so I think Democrats were pretty optimistic at that point.
"Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, very different."
"I care so deeply about the values and ideals of this country, not just saying it as some slogan though, but really kind of living by it and also trying to improve things to always make things better and have that arc of history turned towards empowering people treating people with dignity."
And I think the third thing is she has to show herself as a moderator who can appeal to centrists.
It's so true.
"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision is critical because it mandates that all mail-in ballots must be signed and dated by voters, and they must be returned within a specified time frame."
"Look, no, no."
But then there's Gallup.
"For parts of two centuries, scores of black men and women put their lives on the line for the right to vote, and that's what keeps voter engagement as a top priority for the National Panhellenic Council, the governing body for nine of the country's oldest and most prominent black sororities and fraternities."
Why is her campaign focusing on this voting group?
They're trying to make it into that.
Joe Biden open convention.
"Republicans voted in support of passing this, and it was signed into law in 2019."
What is your work in these next weeks going forward?

And the next is Trump will 100% focus on cutting down the tax from 25% to 15% for companies who will manufacture in United States for example XYZ company manufactures in China and now they want to they are paying 25% tax and let's say example I'm telling you let's say they are they start manufacturing in United States so Trump promises for them to charge less tax so probably like around 15% tax and that will be really in benefit for America because it will bring a lot of jobs because he wants to bring jobs in the United States he doesn't want people to really starve or remain without jobs and all the foreigners are really coming here and just grabbing all the jobs and the Americans are really remaining behind without any jobs I'm talking about them skilled workers I'm not talking about the unskilled workers so the next is 37 days from now Trump says very very clear he's going to defeat lion Kamala Harris and sleepy Joe it makes me a little bit laugh the way because the way he says lion Kamala Harris and the sleepy Joe that's the reason it makes me laugh that's the only reason and I don't laugh on Kamala Harris or sleepy Joe because he's funny sometimes the next is Trump promises to lower the taxes and make life much better and easier and cleaner so they can really afford everything and clothing to groceries to fuel and everyday life of course all the families will be able to afford so they would love America more and more and they'll fall in love with this country more and more and of course they will be ready to give their lives for this country because he wants to make America the best place on the planet Earth now also Trump humbly acknowledges that if he loses if he loses this election and Kamala Harris wins then he doesn't care like he doesn't have he doesn't have anything bad to say about in return but he doesn't care but the only thing he's focusing on that is all he cares about is he wants to do his job what he promises and of course I think so he will do his job because that will be his last four years in his entire life so he wants to make America powerful again and America clean again and America great again so now he got three things powerful great and clean so he'll be focusing on this very very immensely and I think so that he will succeed 100% now Trump promises to bring the entire energy prices down and he will be focusing only on one thing on the golden oil under the feet of Americans that's of course that's patrol so now of course now he's just keep on saying of course drill baby drill so that means of course all the energy price will come down and we'll be able to afford the gas and like for now at present times we are struggling not we the the people who are making less money and having a little bit bigger families they are struggling to fill up the gas tanks in their cars and of course and he says they it'll he will make it very easier for them so they will be able to afford gas and fill up the tanks and also groceries and all other sectors so in this video as I covered all the points this are the takeaway points from his rally what he really what he recently made in Pennsylvania so now and one thing I want to talk about in the I want to touch this that and I'm pretty sure Trump if he loses if he loses if he loses I know he doesn't care because he cannot do anything after that but if he wins trust me I think so he will make America great again because he will clean with criminals he will close the borders and he will make America powerful again clean again and America great again and he wants to make America the manufacturing powerhouse that means all the manufacturing will take place in America with off I'm talking about the American companies like Apple of course it will manufacture in America 100% he will try to do that but if he does that believe me that would be great but again let's see what and what cost these companies will agree and not agree also but the points what he just put down in front of the people they were really amazing and really attracting and let's see how many votes will really get and based on that we will see where America is heading thank you so much for watching and see in the next video don't forget to subscribe the channel so it'll help me to to make more and more videos and see you next time bye bye take care

"And I think she's doing exactly the right thing, which is pulling on recent comments, showing the words coming out of his own mouth, and then connecting the dots to our lived reality."

"But in our 50, Trump got 48."

We are getting to the last leg of the presidential election and the race is seeing some small but dramatic changes.
And that's a little nerve-wracking because the Biden infrastructure is problematic because it did not involve hardcore grassroots organizing that was kind of characteristic of the Obama ascendancy.

"It's a method by which you extract natural gas, which is the cleanest fossil fuel in America."

Trump and Harris are locked in a virtual tie in two out of eight polls.

He's not being honest with himself.
"Of course, you got to love your country."
"And then after that, switched and voted to form President Trump in 2016 before going back to President Biden in 2020."

"Although I do got some individuals out there I really got some hate for you know, but to to want to see Someone uh lose their life is like whoa, you know what?"
There's really no words.
What can we expect from the former president today?
"So a boost from Taylor Swift, I would say doesn't hurt."
So what in the campaign math makes you think that this is the best strategy right now to spend time in Trump country?
Now let's go back to the present and look at the latest polls.

The state's voters know their ballots carry immense weight.
"Um, so I mean, it is what it is."
It's all fake.

"These areas have seen a shift in voter sentiment, especially among women and college-educated voters who have increasingly moved away from traditional Republican support."
"And on these issues, Donald Trump and Republicans for large clearly have the advantage."
But here's the thing to remember.
I honestly think that he used to understand how tariffs work.
I don't think that's good news for Harris.
"Now you're getting multiple polls, some liberal polls coming out saying Trump's leading Michigan when the entire liberal narrative was that, Oh my God, she's going to win Michigan."
I mean the election is not for another eight months.
Kamala Harris is doing two points at least worse than Hillary Clinton was eight years ago.
This was effectively his home state.
"For your outstanding next United States Senator, Ruben Gallo."
I mean if you're gonna do it do it right and yes that is patriotism at its best.
There's a reason he underperformed Donald Trump when the national environment was eight points to the right of what it was in 2020.

"But in those three months, of course, everything in the political world has changed."
"But still, Nevada, is that a sign of it moving to the right?"
"What you see in my opponent, a former President of the United States, really is, it demeans the office."
It's very interesting.

That's what I think about these days.
"Despite being in what the Trump campaign calls a honeymoon period, Harris' momentum is influencing down-ballot races, benefiting Democratic candidates in Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina."
"I thought it was at 100%, turned out I was right."
"Not perfect, but quite accurate in a way that many other national pollsters have really missed the mark."
Well I wanted to hear as I said at the beginning I wanted to hear honest actual policy proposals and I wanted to hear the truth and I got some honest policy proposals but they all came from Kamala Harris.
There's just no two ways around this.
"Well, obviously there are quite a few developments here in Georgia."
"So the focus on Pennsylvania at this time is critical because of everything that we have seen, but also in terms of this law."
"Bottom line, where do things go from here for both the prosecution and those who are defending the suspects here?"
Senator Casey.
"I mean, I had like at least five different cases that were gone in a matter of 20 minutes, in a matter of 20 minutes or less, five cases of books, about at least 100 books in them, I think 50 books per cases."
"There's there's about 50 percent are Democrats, about 25 percent are Republicans, and then 25 percent are independent, at least here in Pennsylvania."
"Well, that's because Dave McCormick has spent a lot of money and very effectively to put some doubt in the minds of voters, Pennsylvania Republican voters, about Dr. Oz."

Thanks for watching stay updated about breaking news and top stories on the NBC News app or follow us on social media.
And these were people that he put his trust in.
The Cash App link is in the description.
And that's what we heard.
"We had people from Rhode Island here yesterday, Connecticut, because they can get it faster than I can ship it."
So the question is this.
A strong push for commonsense leadership emerged as the speaker emphasized the importance of electing capable representatives to facilitate significant changes in governance.
"By emphasizing this point, Trump's campaign can paint Democrats as being opposed to necessary safeguards, potentially swaying undecided voters and those concerned about election security."
Kamala Harris received 50 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 44 percent.
They're going to have to establish a little residency.
Kamala Harris received 48% of the vote and Donald Trump 49%.
I'm not too worried about the people around this table.
"He is very pro-Israel, which may alienate some of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party that has obviously a very anti-Israel stance amid the war in Gaza."
"I'm no longer invited to art galleries, music festivals, tattoo conventions."
You didn't know you had that problem here?
Release polls about this battleground state that should tell us a lot about where the current state of the race is in Pennsylvania with its 19 electoral votes.
"Don't vote for something that you don't believe in just because, you know, you appeal to your friend or Instagram or any of this nonsense."
You're at the checkout line.
And are you going to what's going on?
"Oil and gas works in many towns, just like the ones you're here from."
They're very sensitive to the love.
" I think it's kind of chaotic, but I am really excited that Kamala is running."
We'll be back soon to explore another topic shaping the 2024 election.
Have a good one.
How many polls have to be released with him in the lead?
It's sure that the Democrats are behind.
"What does it say, um, about, about this ticket's working class appeal that even, even though he was endorsed by the leadership of the organization that he was speaking at, the rank and file were clearly hostile to his campaign."
Where do you want to begin?
"That's just not something that happens because when it gets identified, there are severe consequences, whether it's prosecution and or deportation from the country."
I question Trump's support at 46 percent.
"Joe, I can't tell you how rare that is."
I did So decision made there.
"But another race where you had a blind spot was North Dakota, where you did see Rick Becker, who was just objectively the America first anti-establishment candidate, even pro-Trump candidate."
"I'm just saying, you're asking me why."
Well this poll is in the margin of error.
I've spent a lot of time there particularly in 2020 The people there are unsure about it say there's actually a divide between it is either bear or Barry It's named after a guy named Isaac B-a-r-r-e with an accent in a French pronunciation But there there is indecisiveness even on the level of how to pronounce that in that County that is in Lezern County which is particularly fascinating because that is a Obama Obama Trump Trump County It's a place that about five years before Donald Trump really even stepped onto the political stage a guy named Lou Barletta ran from Hazleton the neighboring town to Wilkes-Barre and kind of set the playbook for a populist candidate like Donald Trump years before he did it so this is a place that Harris sees potential VP Harris sees potential to win back an area that traditionally has been a bit red but that Obama president Obama was able to win only about a decade ago So we got some new polling numbers out from Reuters and it shows Harris up five points over Trump nationwide I mean when we're talking about such a close race five points is kind of significant I think over half the respondents also said that they viewed Harris as a winning the debate against Trump So I don't know about this this poll.
And I don't think that's what America.
He always paid his bills?
"He walked down the steps of his plane unassisted and again a show of support, a show of strength, and a show of strength from the FBI."
"That's a big question, because another poll, this ABC Ipsos poll, who looked across the high contenders for the Veep stakes here, none of them really have national name recognition."
"But it's seemingly that really maybe it affected it a little bit, but we've seen Trump shoot right back up in terms of the betting and those Republican internal polls are not going to be input onto real clear politics or anything like that."
Remember where we started with the pandemic.
I'm hearing from people who are mad at me because they say I'm not being optimistic enough about Kamala's chances.
"I guess it's possible, but I find it so unlikely that I just don't think it's going to happen."
"In typical Trump fashion, he personalized the criticism, making it about himself, rather than focusing on the larger picture."
I think they're every six minutes.
It actually is giving Trump just as many votes as Philadelphia is in excess giving the votes for whoever the Democratic candidate is.
Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote while Donald Trump received 50%.
"And now his trade policies, particularly with tariffs, are basically just gibberish."
Some of these counties feeling left behind?
"President Trump is somebody that I appreciate for his fight, his tenacity, his wisdom, and his ability to get things done."
We do not need a president who's willing to make problems worse to make his politics better.
"She says, I'm not going to ban fracking."
You could easily see Donald Trump make massive gains.
"She won by 10 points, etc."
I don't want your honor.
Has anyone thought about unplugging America and plugging it back in again?
Projected American weakness all across the world.
In relationship to former President Trump.
He's winning Georgia right now.
"I spoke to a child, a young girl who crossed the border with her mother when she was six years old and she had been separated from her for three years."
So this is a real weakness from Trump.
So I started this in 2019.
But the truth is that people are feeling the pinch.
People are saying it's the greatest.
We have team coverage of the stops she made.
"Garrett, great to talk to you."
I mean that meant lots of people.
And they mean business.
"So months after that assassination bid on former President Donald Trump, a theatrical comeback of former President Donald Trump at that same location, listening to the highlights from his campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania."
"And I found that that for the most part, if you're not talking to Hannity, if you're not talking to, again, Ingraham, in some cases, it's going to be fair."
Absolutely It's funny because the Democrats and Kamala Harris have been calling Donald Trump a threat to democracy Have you heard this stuff and what do you make of that when you hear that?
"And if they're talking about their decision with our fallopian tubes, where else does that go?"
"Republicans in Pennsylvania are dramatically overstayed or understated, I should say."
Here is what Alina Habba did.

And basically just sloganeers the entire time.
"And yeah, you did have some pollsters that were like flooding the zone, they will say, but you can't compare a midterm year to a presidential year."
Now please subscribe if you haven't already.
"So in the in the in the truest sense of the term, these are indeed swing states, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania."
Joining me today is the Center Squares Pennsylvania reporter Anthony Hennen.
800 likely voters were sampled here between August 18th and 19th.
Mitt Romney let me down.
"Unlike other states with stable support for one particular party, Pennsylvania contains both Democratic-leaning urban areas and Republican-leaning rural areas."
There's questions about how the hurricane is going to impact voter turnout there.
I think it's at least useful for a barometer.
"By 1996, Jesse Jackson had to beg, beg for airtime at that convention."
"And so much of that, at least for Trump and Trump supporters, depending on the state, is how much you'll buy into the 2020 was rigged and President Trump actually won and it was stolen from him, something that Democrats just love getting Republican primary candidates to say so they can run against it."
"And it's not just like, oh, he's down by one."
"This is in the middle of a pandemic, which is pretty absurd."
"Years ago, parties had liberals and conservative, believe it or not, they had liberals and conservatives in them, in both parties."
"She goes, absolutely."
"Now, I know people are going to say, but Democrats are going to vote on Election Day, which I'm not denying."
I'm sorry to me.
"However, Harris does better on issues such as like abortion, or issues of, you know, integrity or character."
I love having Kayleigh McEnany on a Monday.
"I think that's a successful way to go after your opponent, is to talk about their record."
"Negative partisanship is the most effective campaigning tool in any race, from city council to the race for president."
I was raised by strong black women and black men who respected them as equals.
"In fact, per decision desk HQ's latest average, Trump and Harris are tied based on a total of 10 polls, and Harris had even led recently."
So of course he'll be closing the borders and he will be taking the serious action.
"I remember reading that about, I don't know, a month ago."
"Right now Trump's up by, you know, point two percent and that's with an outlier."
"If you're just joining me, President Trump, the 45th President of the United States has been shot at a rally."
"Fight, motherfucker."
You all remember these arrows.
"When they shot me, I said, oh, ooh, they shot me."
I'm not shocked that that has filtered its way to people's sense about the strength of the economy.
"I mean, we all know that Kamala Harris is like, like, so left."
You know how annoying he's going to be now?
"The governor's office reached a $295,000 settlement with the accuser."
"They went through the San Francisco trope, the many different tropes, leaning into attacking her own racial identity basis."
Let's move on to the next topic.
"CNN said that one of her most popular moments in the debate, according to internal polling was when she said, clearly, I am not Joe Biden."
Have you guys seen clips from the incident?
But Philadelphia is actually given the Democrats less and less votes.
"Well, you get it from far right media."
"Man, what come to gas then?"
And they're recent enough that that's fair game if he wants to talk about when she was a proponent of ending fracking.
"Get the new exclusive teas, mugs and stickers right now at store.mitastouch.com."
"Nevertheless, the people who did want to talk on the record about their choices were adamant."
And there are some new rules in the state Republicans have been lobbying for.
"Good morning, Earl."
And that's with some big outliers.
I actually don't.
The highest award you can get is a civilian.
We are looking at the number of early votes already cast in the states that allow early voting.
They were sharing with me a story of some churches who will not pass on the great controversy because they believe Trump is an evil man.
"The one I keep thinking about is the business of people eating other people's pets, which strikes me as so moronic a thing to say and to repeat."
"But if it's even just a 10 point shift towards Trump, he's got Pennsylvania."
"By attacking this law, Trump is not just spreading misinformation, but actively working to disenfranchise the very people he claims to support our troops."
"Mayor Abdullah Hamoud, thank you so much for speaking with us."
I get caught 15 years.
Harris finished 1 point ahead of Trump in this poll.
And we will win.
"If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing."
"Very true because the way he approached things, we had our friends respecting us, enemies fearing us."
That's all gone.
It's third on the list right now.
And that's basically where we are.
I think he's worse than Oz.
"This is, and I mean this sincerely, there could be no safer place in America right now than Butler, Pennsylvania, and on the farm show grounds right here, and everybody's so eagerly awaiting the next president, former President 45, to become the 47th president of the United States."
I understand that.
And the Democratic National Convention kicks off on Monday.
So we'll have to see what happens on that front.
Let me sing that song.
"You know, 46 getting hit by everything."
This person's really a Trump fan.
And Donald Trump offers a different approach.
You're talking about 27 percent of vote being Catholic and they are breaking away from the Democratic Party.
"For the last 20 years of my life, Arab Americans and Muslim Americans have made secondary the issues of foreign affairs."
"His attacks against Harris increasingly dark and profane, saying this at another Pennsylvania campaign event on Saturday night."
"Every day we flip the switch on, we use our cell phone, we turn on the TV, we drive our vehicles, we put on our clothes, we heat our homes."
"Especially now, with the cost of everything, they need to be creative, find a different niche, advertise that."
Do you think that that issue remains such a potent driver in this election?
But we are just only about 90 days out from the election.
"So yes, is the answer."
You could get people out to vote that would probably not vote otherwise while Democrats they may be more reliant on election day.

This can only happen.
"As Secretary of State, Schmidt is visiting each of Pennsylvania's 67 counties."
This is a purple state.

He will use the Department of Justice.
"And when you have Democrats coming out with anxiety, leaking to publications on the state, Pennsylvania Democrats, national Democrats, it usually is a sign that there's some nerve-wracking appetites happening in the campaign."
They have Trump at 50 and Harris at 48.
And we thought that that would.
And then you've also got stuff in Nevada and Michigan.

"But think about how much it benefits people like Vladimir Putin, all of our enemies, when Americans don't even trust the institutions in the country that they live in."

"Trump had 48 percent, Harris at 47.8."
"But it's just hard to, I feel like, get our generation to see the long-term effects of not being or using your political voice through voting or getting out there and just spreading whatever word you feel is best that you believe in."
The question is whether that enthusiasm will translate into enough votes to offset Harris' early voting lead.
"Forty three percent of MSNBC viewers think the Republican Party is the biggest enemy facing America, although I will say that 56 percent of Newsmax people think the Democrat Party is."
I think she's doing it in a lot of reasons because the race is that close.
Don't miss your chance to hook Trumpy Trout.
"You know, there's 100 Republicans now that have left and they're in Harris' camp."
"Third, and this might be the biggest difference maker in a democracy, there is no place for political violence."

Patriot polling is here also.
He'll be heading to North Carolina as well later this week.

 And it's not good news for Kamala Harris and the Democrats.
"But then we go to these ties, and we're gonna look at these two right here."
"We obviously knew he was going to be there that day, but I had zero expectation."

"I don't know why Mike Lee just sounds like really like Republican for a reason, but he's not."
"I mean, do you see a strategy to the way he's campaigning?"
"We've got two weeks, give or take, before the midterms."
Hear me when I say that Donald Trump wants you to have a lousy Christmas.
"So the fact that they're not doing so well compared to 2022, you know, even taking into account the fact they're likely going to surpass their totals, that's a very low turnout election."

It's a drawing.
He would not vote for Trump a third time.

That is the laugh of a crazy person.
"Because part of it makes me think, not speaking to men directly, part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as President."
Today I make you this promise.
"Okay, let's do a couple of questions."
"Because for instance, if we're seeing a poll that showed Biden down five across the state, and we see Kamala Harris now up either tied or up a few points, or down one point and massive improvements that are off minority groups, that Kamala Harris, as we've known from 2020 and 2024, has done, makes major improvements on relative to President Biden."
"This includes visits to local businesses and community events, such as her unannounced stop at a cafe and bookstore in Johnstown."

There's going to be a lot less mail-in ballot votes just because it's not COVID anymore.
 former president Donald Trump in Pennsylvania today for a rally.

"But either way, I just wanted to update everyone on this."
Yeah.
But they were talking about that in the space before I ended up making this video.
"Again, I put this in a video, went out last night."
That's why her campaign's talked about North Carolina doesn't really seem as if that state is going to be going in the left direction this election cycle regardless.
"You look at a county like Monroe County, there was like, you know, Trump got 5,000 votes there in 2020."
"The latest survey here though, again from Qantas Polls and News, between August 14th and 15th, is Harris leading by 2 points, 46.2% to 44.6%, among 601 registered voters."
"An interesting scenario, but you'll see how close the margin is."
"But still, you know, is it really going to be enough?"
"And that's more than likely because he's from this area on paper like, oh, yeah, he's Scranton Joe."
With 61% backing him compared to just 28% for Harris.
"A very accurate Donald Trump impression, actually."
"Sign up, get involved."
Another Trump term with JD Vance would be far worse and would lead our country down a path that I don't think we could ever recover from.
It's not just the Latinos latinx community that they're struggling with maybe because they keep calling them latinx.
"Demographically speaking, this is a state that should go for Trump by like five points at the bare minimum."

And don't forget to hit that notification bell so you never miss a video.
"I mean, you're crazy if you do believe you."

He'll be a dictator on day one.
Just about your outlook on life and your future.
"And moreover, that's not what any Republican or Democrat has done before President Trump."
But guess what?
And I think it's going to be a different presidency.
Off by 12.
"Remember, it was only two weeks ago that President Biden exited the race and that the party rallied behind Harris to replace him at the top of the ticket."
"So if there's an individual that is on the fence and they don't know who to vote for because they've been listening to the internet and online and seeing joy, happiness, vibes, all that type of stuff, what would you tell them to sway them to vote for the right person?"
"You see it right here, a neck and neck in the Keystone State."
"So simply let's simply put, if you hear that 25,000 is going to be discounted from the house as a homeowner, what would you do as a homeowner?"
"But it's important, right?"
Republicans for Harris.
It flipped back to President Biden in 2020 and now it's up for grabs again.
It's not just about policies that are on the ballot it is about values and it is about character.
"I think it's black women, and especially in this case, thinking beyond ourselves, it's about winnability because the alternative is so scary."
"Vice President Harris, meanwhile, spent the birthday weekend campaigning in Michigan and Georgia."
Good to be with you.
"This is the white house's response, which is incredible."
"Now, why is it that this is very good news for Kamala Harris in the final days leading up to what will be the most consequential, the most important state for either candidate to have a smooth sailing path to victory on election night?"
"During the course of an interview that covered a wide variety of subjects, the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, provided a comprehensive analysis of the political dynamics that are taking place in his state."
And so it will be very enticing to watch just how much this election is defined by what happens at this moment in time.
That's Kamala's people right there.
So many interesting aspects of this polling.
I take it you believe the election was stolen.
"OK, so we've covered the polls, the demographics, the economy and voter turnout."
I feel safe.
"So what we're hearing with these leaks about her staff and that she's not there, she's not participating, mirrors what we heard from her staff that constantly left when she as being in the White House as vice president."
"So not only could that again help them here, but it could help bring that voter base back to the left for Harris if Shapiro is on the ticket."
They're taking a lawn sign.
"It wasn't just marginal, it was massive reductions."
I understand Kamala Harris is outraised Donald Trump.
John Federman is a train wreck.
Their polls in Pennsylvania in 2020 were amazing.
I'm just tired of it.
So I realized what was happening.
"2016, it was even worse."
I don't know that you could really argue that Donald Trump is.
He's ranting and rambling until people get bored and leave his rallies.
"We hope I'm so excited to listen to that because I'm totally in that culture, the whole alternatives, skateboard and all that."
"And they run in by the hundreds and they're running out carrying refrigerators and carrying air conditioners and big stuff, big, little everything."
 Pennsylvania voters react to the Trump and Harris debate.
Maybe he's a supporter.
"And they're doing so because they're under assault on campaign commercials that are running on radio, TV and social media, in which Vice President Harris outlines her plans and is very specific about the things that she will do."
That's why Trump's excellent showing in the latest polls is an important step towards the presidency.
"The opiate crisis has hit Ohio particularly hard, and both parties have made efforts to address the epidemic."
One of the reasons why we fixed more roads and bridges than ever before is because of our partnership with the Biden-Harris administration.
"It's OK, as long as our side wins."
"But I need to know right off the bat, I've been there so many times for politics, Wilkes-Barre, Wilkes-Barre or Wilkes-Barre."
He is unwilling to do a 60 minutes interview.
"I could certainly see Harris, if she wins the state, getting 50 to 51 percent of the vote though."
So they're going to be here duking it out to get these votes.
"I'm like, okay, so here's the deal."
This was what's interesting.
But Santa Claus is real.
You could see Erie County went for Biden by around one with the 2020 demography and Northampton County went blue by around 0.7%.

"Oh, I want to talk about IVF."
"It's the age thing, right?"
"This whole U.S. Steel thing is emblematic, perhaps, of manufacturing jobs and the importance of manufacturing jobs in western Pennsylvania, a key part of the strategy for winning Pennsylvania this year."
"Starwalt's observations highlight the importance of understanding the concerns of rural voters, many of whom may feel disconnected from the Democratic Party's mainstream narratives."
State parties didn't give us enough support.
"Do you think that their messages are getting through to voters, in particular those who are still undecided?"
I believe so.
"And it should also be pointed out that we've been covering a lot of voting changes that have been implemented in the states after 2020, a lot of Republican attempts to change the voting laws in light of 2020."
How many of you have voted for Donald Trump?
"And Trump says that Democrats want to dilute the true vote, but he's the one that tried to convince Mike Pence into unilaterally deciding the election."
It's in this.
But that's all I can really say about it.
"Trump can win the election without even knowing if he won Pennsylvania, if he wins some other important states."
"You got a convention in about 10 days, debate September 10th."
 Back to today's video.
Six electors.
He missed on purpose.
"Most of all, most of all, Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them, between the, quote, real Americans, which, by which he means his supporters, and the outsiders who don't support him."
But there's a long way to go.
So two wildly different strategies.
Welcome to Doug in Exile.
"So it says new general election poll Pennsylvania Harris 49%, Trump 46%."
"You know, if you have an insurrection, you don't say peacefully and patriotically, right Mike?"
Illinois is a reliably Democratic state voting for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since 1992.
That's what the article really calls into question.
"Harris's challenge lies in not only maintaining democratic turnout in these counties, but also in appealing to moderate and undecided voters who may feel alienated by either party."
Seven hundred thousand voters right now.
"And when you look at the demography of it, you're getting like a Trump plus three if this holds up."
Donald Trump just survived getting his ears pierced at Claire's.
"Some even say it's the enemy of the people, which is why I recommend Ground News."
We're not sure how they were able to get a weapon in.
"But now the recent polling, it's Trump plus one Harris plus one."
"CNN, a 10 point shift."
All play crucial roles in determining the victory of any candidate.
"And then I think he said something like, ha ha ha, he thinks he bothers me or some crap like that."
"It's unfortunate, but Bartos, he seems to be an establishment guy."
Because you know what happens?
"Trump was able to win them over in 2016 by lying to them but his track record hasn't given them anything to gravitate to, especially since 2020 and also since he got elected and I think that his various troubles that he's having legally, it's gonna come to bear in a very important state like Pennsylvania in this upcoming election but that's all I got for you guys in this one, please be sure to like the video, subscribe to the channel, share with someone who's into politics and I'll catch you guys in the next video, peace."
"And if you take out inactive voters, Meghan, people that haven't voted in, say, four years or eight years, that number is just 160,000."
What about values?
We don't call each other names.
The New York Times reported this weekend that Donald Trump is kind of disoriented by this shift from Biden to Harris.
The fact that they didn't walk in there first.
A lot of times the party out of power is more motivated to vote.
He came out and talked about free expression and how it's a stumbling block for fighting disinformation.
Now I don't know if you're there.
Republicans back Trump 91 to 7 percent.
She is in deep trouble.
But the damage had already been done.
Harris is more positive.
"You have others that are a little more maybe a little more social liberal, the Harris."
"President Trump, in his tenure in the White House, was a lot more affordable, and the American dream was in reach for our generation."
"I mean that we're, we're overtaxed."
These are the counties that moved the farthest left and the farthest right from 2016 to 2020 that The New York Times did.
"And remember, at this point in 2020, Biden was actually up by seven there."
They can do it.
But it is also different.
"You selected at that point, but not prior."
"That's right, China."
Do you think the vice president did enough tonight to convince voters in your state that she won't ban fracking?
"Now, this will also be the first time she and her running mate will formally be seen together."
And look at all this Trump support.
What do you ask Vice President Harris?
"And actually, she looked very much like a great first lady, Melania."
"She pulled behind, but now all of a sudden everybody likes her and she's bringing new energy into the party."
"And in fact, I was the tiebreaking vote on the inflation reduction act, which opened new leases for fracking."
Does it's a complete mess?
Some people are saying there is no lens that these politicians are not going to go to be able to get a seat at that position.
He won every county in Michigan.
"Yeah, I have to tell you at last check the Secret Service told me 24,000 people have turned out to this rally last rally."
I don't think presidents have a huge deal to do with gas prices.
And also this came out in statistics.
I cannot provide content that promotes a specific political party or a specific candidate.
"But if it wasn't for that one poll, Trump right now in the RCP average more than likely would be up by like a point, maybe two."
They should be in places like Georgia.
I wanted to finish here.
Now in a previous episode of CNN News Central I circled Pennsylvania many many times to emphasize just how important it could be in the election.
Support for the Republican candidate among black voters is at an all-time high in over a decade.
Our farm currently feeds out approximately 70 to 100 head of cattle and that is reduced from 180 to 200 head just two to four years ago.
But this is not about moving a constituency that is feeling deep pain.
"That is at $6,000 for the first year of the child's life."
And I can only manage myself.
"But in today's video, we are going to talk about that."
"70, 75% of people support this."
He's over the top.
This is a person that's literally real like he's he's nervous being up there He's speaking from you know the heart and I love it.
"Exactly, and for those who find that reassuring, this probably just made that connection stronger."
"So it's not only the rhetoric, it's also the policy proposals."
"I mean, Bill Clinton is like campaigning for Trump at this point."
"Well, what we've been seeing the last couple of days are two wildly different strategies."
I don't agree with that.
I'm gonna get my shoes.
He is okay.
"She might even lose ground in a lot of these suburbs of Philadelphia, depending on the suburb, like the working-class suburbs in Bucks County."
"What up, what up, what up, y'all?"
I don't know why that is.
"Because I just think that when you think about it in terms of a historic American industry, not to mention what it means for the workforce in the economy of Pittsburgh, of Pennsylvania, but also from a national security perspective, it is important that we have U.S. manufacturing of U.S. Steel."
"I want to get granular with you for a moment if I can, Senator."
"Remember back in 2016 when Jill Stein got 1% of the vote in Michigan, Trump won it by 0.3%."
"Does academic and activist Cornel West, who is running for president as an independent candidate, won't be on the ballot in Pennsylvania the Supreme Court decided Monday in upholding a lower court's ruling?"
"And he did not seem, you know, he seemed unperturbed by the extraordinary set of events that are just unfolded in front of him."
"Like, Earl and Jill Stein."
These are not people that were Democrats.
"Well, I really think the people that are supporting Donald Trump had been with Donald Trump throughout."
We are going to be talking about that Pelosi interview.
"So that's really, really important."
"And actually, it's a little bit more likely than the polls are leading on to."
I've listened to him talk.
They're just saying how they're going to bring down prices for the everyday American.
Let's face it.
"I do have to point out that along with his intentions, there is also a question of his competence."
And that is further proven by this clip right here.
"No, Biden fought them very hard and they never got what they wanted to get anyway."
"It costs too much anyway, but they're both OK."
"Just to barely win the presidency and even if you get to 69, that's not enough."
We will stop.
What more can you tell us about the efforts?
"Like, don't just scroll through your social media feed and call it a day."
Glad to be here.
So fracking is hugely important for the voters of Pennsylvania.
"When they asked Kamala countless times how she would lower prices in the stores and get inflation under control, she went through this diatribe about how she grew up in a middle class family."
Bye-bye.
"And given Trump has been president in the past, we know voters can compare his administration to the Biden administration."
"Now, let's see here."
"By focusing on these issues, Trump hopes to strengthen support from rural voters and attract more middle-class suburban voters."
Harris is proving to be a formidable opponent.
It looks like anywhere from eight to 10 bullets were fired.
So that's behind partly of his lead.
Right here.
"So at this point, it's more of a question on the margins."
We see a tie in the CBS new you gov poll.
"He's maintaining a big lead, which I didn't even expect."
"Number two, the jobs have been added because the COVID is over or, or I'm not going to say it's over."
"If you're just joining us, former President Donald Trump has been shot."
He believed in honest argument and hearing the views of other people.
What's your reaction to that in Donald Trump's statements in general saying that the Medal of Freedom is better than the Medal of Honor?
The battle for these voters is far from over.
There's only so many police officers that can go around to help folks as far as that's concerned.
"Peter explained how, look, Biden is getting about 94% in the Pennsylvania presidential primary."
He is now there is now glass in front of him when he speaks.
"It's a huge industry, but it's not just the present jobs, it's the future jobs."
"For your next member of Congress from the 6th District, Kirsten Engel."
"Because here in Erie, they've asked him for a $35,000 payment for the previous rally, which he has ignored."
Doesn't it seem that Trump has struck a nerve in Pennsylvania?
"But nonetheless, you are seeing Trump, this is very healthy."
I'm glad everyone's okay.
"I mean, the stuff that Harris said about the Knights of Columbus, for example, it is real bad."
Everybody poops.
Part of the message has to do with immigration.
"Masriano, he was really, really out there."
"Because I've actually seen you online get criticized, get ridiculed."
"So, you know, so we were all right there."
Let's just trust what we can see and hear ourselves.
" Hey everybody, I am your host Alad reporting here in Pennsylvania outside of this Trump rally Let's go talk some of his support to see what's going on."
How do you think that's going to play with some Latino Hispanic voters?
You represent a majority black district.
"This county voted for Romney, for crying out loud and voted for Biden by just under twenty points, but this county in recent months has seen a surge of Republican support."
I'll write out a little piece of paper.
Guns and bloody throwing...
Gen Z specifically is considered the most racially diverse voting block and tend to vote Democrat.
Look at absentee requests.
I believe they do.
And that's why they reacted that way to him.
The 44th president known for his calm and cool demeanor expressed a burst of emotions rarely seen as he accused Donald Trump of threatening America's democracy.
"Everybody here, we are not buying it."
It finds that right now the race for the White House is close with Kamala Harris having a one point edge over former President Trump nationally.
And these are the counties that Biden won in 2020 that helped him flip the state back from Trump.
 Well today former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are back on the campaign trail Trump will hold a press conference in Los Angeles County this afternoon before heading to Las Vegas for a rally this evening Harris is back in Pennsylvania today stopping first in Johnstown before holding a rally later this evening in Wilkes-Barre We have team coverage this morning with CBS News campaign reporters Zach Hudak and Olivia Rinaldi I want to start with Zach who is covering the Harris campaign for us from Washington So Zach Harris's event in Pennsylvania tonight.
That is our task.
He turned it around.
Be sure to watch through to the end to see the huge amount the last person on the list donated.
The back to back errors in 2016 and 2020.
And yet here I am talking about the crises that are unfolding thousands of miles away.
And certainly the polling doesn't seem to have given that big bounce.
"Like, like, like that's, that's the thing."
And we've got to earn their vote and continue to speak directly to this economic message.
"Okay, finally, what's RFK Jr. up to?"
Let's go nice and loud.
"And in this period, Hillary Clinton was up like 10 points, eight points, a ridiculous amount in the polling in Pennsylvania."
I just thought that was funny.
"Since 2013, I'm looking at the areas in and around where you represent York County."
"I mean, I kind of looked at my classes and went back to bed."
I believe it.
"Kimberly Klasek, candidate for the state's second congressional district in Maryland, said her party was reaching out to black voters."
It remains to be seen whether it's this is this is how I cover my my left flank.
Usually presidential candidates have months to sort out their vp picks.
"Even then, do you really think Michigan is going to vote like four to five points to the left of Pennsylvania?"
And that's a key democratic county.
We literally just ask Americans questions and report on the results.
"Oh, I think the prosecution lets this hang out in the air for as long as they can."
"By the way, we'll be talking about John Kerry later."
"He might be a solution, but the solution to the world's problem today is the same person that he's always been."
"No, these are brand new voters that are becoming voters for the first time, whether because they're 18, whether it's because they never voted beforehand, whatever."
And look at that deal.
So how do you allow homeownership to happen?
We are all praying that he is okay.
What's your reaction to that?
She said she was going to ban fracking.
Immigration.
But I also think we're going to see the shift from Harris back into a more aggressive prosecution of the case against Trump.
Does age matter?
Thousands of individuals.
That's a one off.
"First off, I love Tom Hagan."
"However, in the 2020 US presidential election, Joe Biden won the electoral votes in Pennsylvania with 1.17 percent more votes than Trump."
"So the gunman was unalived, you know, taken away from the scene."
"OK, 63 percentage points."
It is indeed a close race.
"I noticed this especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down, is a sign of strength."
"But yeah, this is what it's saying a zero point five percent win for Kamala Harris."
"Yeah, this is a New York Times-Ciena College poll."
Then shift comes out and all of this happens.
But Harris is directly tethered to those policies.
"And yes, that's true, you have to give people something to vote for."
"Now, former President Trump has been critical of these policies in the past."
12 News journalist Troy Lynch went to their event to see why they aren't voting for their own nominee.
President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution.
"So in terms of that argument for 2022, but still I think it's important to take polling with a little bit of a grain of salt."
Did you really have it?
Let's get to the actual news clip here.
 They have been relentlessly attacking each other on the campaign trail and now Vice President Harris and former President Trump will be coming face to face for tonight's debate.
They are blaming Biden for this.
"In recent weeks, the in-state campaign has brought on new staff, which has given some Democrats more confidence, but they fear they're running out of time."
I think I would like to see more ads that actually talk about policies and issues.
Did the especially women what we w the right to vote.
F of 52 equals 46.

"So I want to, I'm doing this because Pennsylvania being the swing state and a must-win state for either candidate this time, I want to show you why you're going to have a lot of indigestion throughout the night on election night and why it's always really late in the evening before they can call the state of Pennsylvania and I'll show you why."

"The pushing with Kamala with more current things like Chaperone and Charlie XCX when it comes to more pop culture stuff, I don't really agree with that."
"So things have certainly gotten better for Kamala Harris than they were for Biden, but I think it's still advantage Republican."
Trump is going to mention this event in every single fucking appearance moving forward the right is going to make t-shirts and mugs and merchandise out of it he apparently mouthed the word fight so expect to see that picture with some filters on it with the fight thing or some tiktok edits expect for the right to get even more radical because of this event and as more information comes out about whatever happened if this was a shooting and that shooter has any left-wing beliefs at any point I'm talking if they liked AOC's tweak at one point in their life it's fucked because anything that you say against Trump will now be painted as oh they're too radical and look this rhetoric caused yeah.

And it's going to be tight because a lot of Americans are struggling right now.
 US What's up YouTube this is 2raw4TV.

We're not going to be silenced.
"And then he says, but I'm hot."

"OK, and even within then, it's only going to be a matter of a few thousand votes."
"That tells me that she understands, yeah, it's going to be hard to get that last yard and a half, but she's doing the right things to be able to do that."
I want this to be a really important evening and those two people that went down are patriots and we love them.

"Yet again, a tie emerges in a third Beacon research poll with both candidates tied at 49%."
"There's a real sense inside the Harris campaign that in Western Pennsylvania, in exurban, in rural areas, the Trump campaign as it did in 2016 and 2020 is going to do pretty well."
I'm unclear what Oz really believes because he keeps changing his mind on a number of these issues.
"The Harris actually wants to do something for a country, and I'm excited about them wanting to do something for the people of this country."
" So Governor, appropriately, the Spilly suburbs and city of Philadelphia gets a lot of attention and a lot of people talk about the T, which is, let's just call it, for lack of a better term, we know what it is, but it's not a center in northern part of the state."
But one thing I did hear and they kept repeating that they said that they felt deserted.
"There is conventional wisdom on this, saying that it will make Trump a more sympathetic feature, a more sympathetic candidate."
So I've actually been canceled pretty much from the visionary culture.
Does that bother you?
"Son of an immigrant, single mom, growing up, and his sisters didn't have much."
Take the words seriously of that song you all.

So that is a safe Trump win.
I was killed the underdogs in this race.
"And if you don't like the current administration, well, she's made all the decisions too."
Thanks for taking this deep dive with us.
People didn't like her.
"These would be laughable things, except these are very widespread."
It is scary.
But this election will be decided in the key battleground states where the race is also essentially tied.
Nobody over 70.
"And even that in certain States, I mean, because a lot of it, a lot of the pandemic was a state to state thing."
You need to be screened to enter this area.
"Do not be a mangled, lily livered, nut hook."

"And a lot of people thought, well, that's crazy."
Fast forward to 2020.

They really are.
"Here in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania."
Getting into the nitty gritty now.
"Just honestly, do your research."
But she got credit for being this Reagan speechwriter.

"And since then, it's only shifted further to the right, as we saw incumbents, Governor Ron DeSantis and Senator Marco Rubio, both win re-election by double digits, 19% in Ron DeSantis's case, and then 16% for Marco Rubio in the Senate race, respectively."
I got to be aggressive and help them grow their incomes.
So recapping real quick in Pennsylvania Harris up six points on Trump in Michigan.
"I know this is going to seem sort of subtle to people, but this is a market change from where we were 10, 15 years ago when the best way to get a Democrat to stop talking about policies that would support people would be to pretend like there was some type of like deficit hockery and that they needed to justify these things, which was all just garbage."
Have you heard what the former president said last night at Israeli here in Pennsylvania?
I heard there was a secret chord that David played and it pleased the Lord.

That's something that in the past Kamala Harris has been opposed to.
"I can't say that I've done it perfectly or that I'm doing it just great, but I'm doing the best I can to elevate the voices in this time of deep pain for the tens of thousands of residents that have called me, contacted me, that have come to our council chambers talking about the sheer death and destruction that they see each and every single day."
"So even if you can pick off a voter here and there, you know, it makes a difference."

He was trailing Trump in many cases by wide margins on the economy.
"Again, Harris isn't actually trying to reach Trump voters at this point."
Pro l and they don't want any t They're just all in for t are.
"Amritpal also, any information on who is leading in the national polls and like you also mentioned, battleground states like Wisconsin, Nevada, Pennsylvania and few more will primarily decide who becomes the president."
"Actually, North Carolina was fucked."
Like if Trump wins Pennsylvania more than likely he wins the presidency and vice versa.
He's the clear favorite even in Wisconsin.
It gets a lot worse.
"So the case was brought against Secretary of State and the election boards in Philadelphia and Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh State and National Democratic Party groups joined the lawsuit supporting its goals."
Give us a sense as to what is the White House's early reaction.
"Well, this is what he had to say about women play this clip And the women are gonna like Trump."
"I think by and large, Kamala Harris is a decent person."
"UAW endorsed Harris, big deal."
And then they come here and then they're told to participate.
"Well, that's verifiably false."
So here are the results.
"New York Times interviewed some local supporters who were really energized, inspired by, you know, his reaction in that moment and decided, you know, not only am I gonna vote for him, I'm gonna volunteer, I'm gonna be a like precinct captain or whatever."

"That is 285,000 Democrat ballots that have been submitted and 95,000 Republican ballots that have been submitted and then 36,000 independent ballots that have been submitted."
"So you know, it looks like from what this article is saying, it's going to be very hard to get real numbers confirming who won either Wisconsin or Pennsylvania on election night, unfortunately at least that's what they're saying here in this article because both Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have not changed apparently any of their laws."
"These are close races, but the stakes are incredibly high."
And I still think there could be some more correction because it's not like the polls are ridiculously outrageous like they were with Trump and Biden to where Trump was leading every state by like five or six points.
"The locusts are given the power to sting like scorpions, but are told not to harm the plants trees or grass."

"She has visited smaller cities like Johnstown, Wilkes-Barre and Pittsburgh, which are in areas that were once reliably Democratic but flipped to Trump in 2016."
"And today we have to talk with the 20, 24 presidential election because the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is a must win state."

"A group of Democrats came up, very Republican County."
"Keep in mind, he's been active in politics now in that area."
"For Harris, engaging with Latino voters, who play a significant role in the state's political dynamics, could be crucial."

"And you heard, you know, Governor Walz talk about, you know, joy and all that."
"So I mean, the concerns are very similar to to other voters."
There was a lot of weird things happening.

"If you don't know who they are outside of their state, sure, he could potentially help Harris win Pennsylvania."

I agree with you.

Think about that.
There are so many different metric points that tell us right now Kamala Harris is in fact turning around this election and the New York Times poll today only affirms that point even more.
"Well, look, what I'll say is that in the 24 hours after Taylor Swift made that endorsement on Instagram, the voter registration site, vote.gov, said it saw 400,000 plus people visit it."
So more economy is good.
"Trump has an advantage in using a tough stance on China to shore up support from working-class voters in manufacturing sectors, while Harris must try to strike a more cautious approach to balance economic and diplomatic interests."

If the polling on real clear politics shows Kamala Harris is losing.
"Yeah, I think um Basically i've had discussions about it before um It's a lesser of two."
"And now that she has Governor Tim Walsom in the ticket, we have yet to see any Pennsylvania polls yet, but I do imagine that will offer a bump to Kamala Harris, even if marginal, any bump will help her, given that now in the most recent polls, she's either leading or tied in this state."

And just let me just show you a comparison.
"Again, what does that mean?"
"Of the vote that the Democrats will get in the election, 44% of that will come from Philadelphia and the suburban counties around Philadelphia."

Donald Trump has had a challenge winning popular votes.
And that's where President Biden has been.
"And if he doesn't win, we all know what happened."
And what we'd love to see now is essential the Democratic Party to move as well.

"If you believe, and I'm not coming to Joe Biden's defense at all."
"Does he need to explain that he's looking to restore a deduction that he caps, correct?"
"Even if it's Dems plus one, it's still good for Republicans because of the way the electoral math works."
"It's like, how is Trump done?"
"His financial backing will help amplify Harris' message and reach a broader audience, particularly in Pennsylvania, where sports and politics often intersect."
"You know, where the geese are in the park, in the lake, and even walking off with their pets."

There's other person talking about how you know serious the situation is and people should just take him more serious.

"As we mentioned earlier, former President Trump is heading to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania tonight for his first rally in that state since his assassination attempt this month in Butler."
But is this an opportunity for the Biden campaign in that region?
While Trump still commands a majority in these areas.

"Trump tells some story about rich people and subsidies, but he's slurring his entire way through this speech."

There's a broad agenda that's out there.
I think we should just take a look at what happened there last night.
Secret Service says the incident did not put Trump or anyone at the rally in danger and so far no federal charges have been filed.
Any any recommendations for for me as I head to fantasy draft this weekend?
"But I'm just saying, like, I don't know the ins and outs."
"As we consider it, what Joe was talking about, this notion that we're seeing changes in the way voters feel about the economy or how the economy would fare under these candidates and Harris more favorably."

That's possible.

Trump is in a heavily Republican area of a version of a part of that state.
"A month ago, Harris was actually above water, as they say, 48 percent favorable and 45 percent negative a month ago."
The Democratic establishment is cheering the choice of Walz as well.

You always hear people feel like the economy is going in a wrong direction and they don't feel great about the economy and poll after poll.

"I was a straight reporter No opinion and I had to kind of you know, I was trained to sort of remove myself in that sense and be dispassionate But I got to the point after 16 years where I felt I knew enough about politics I knew enough about how these people You know strategized Where I really wanted to have more of my own voice because I always liked writing with style So that's why I kind of I moved to commentary because I felt at that point That I had earned enough I had earned enough experience to be able to sort of say what I thought was really was really going on And you know and that's obviously a little bit tricky for some readers because then you get people who are really get angry with your point of view And but I was you know, I was fine with that and I still am And so I've been writing commentary ever since and it obviously it is partisan in the sense that you know, I think you know One side is more correct than the other side But as I try to emphasize I really really believe this that I don't see this as Democratic Democrat versus Republican I see this as facts and truth versus untruths and lies and to me that is you know that to me is the dividing line and if it's partisan to say that factual reality Should be the priority and if it's partisan to say that lies Wrong, then I guess that makes me a partisan In 1988 you wrote the making of an image for the inquirer about the GOP's pioneering TV attack ads How has the role of political journalism changed during your lifetime along this evolving media landscape?"
So they hired a sketch artist.
He's truly sorry.
"Well, there's no question that the road back to the White House leaves right through the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."

"We know, but I'm objective and it wouldn't be fair for me to cover the Pennsylvania polls without shedding some light on some Wisconsin news that might not be so good except, you know, we got to understand where this is coming from because you have a poll in Wisconsin."

This is the swing state of Pennsylvania.
So you really want Donald Trump to win?
We're not to the convention.
One second.
This would be a 3-point overperformance for Harris compared to Biden's winning margin in 2020.
"She emphasized the importance of listening to voters and earning every vote, particularly in areas that are not traditionally Democratic strongholds."
The rest of us can't wait to retire can't wait But they're so addicted to money and power that they cling to it like they're guns and their bombers Joe Biden tried to die in office.

"Great, great toboggan."
"Yes, So we're here live in But PA at the Trump rally, his an appearance here in But it very easy for you."
"Like we just talked about what's going on with the Haitian Americans right now because you know Trump is outwardly sort of antagonizing that group right of people and with spreading lies about you know What's going on with like Haitians in Springfield, Ohio or whatever?"
It's something that there's been a lot of interviews in the media here with undecided voters and they all sort of have different issues that that they're concerned about or going back and forth between the candidates on.
"And we just can't say enough that when I send you some pictures later on this week, and next week of what we're able to pull off here, this sort of scared the pants off of the Democrats."
They're from Japan.
And fight is what's going to get us to win in November.
How do you think that's going to play into this election?
"Friedman's $750,000 donation to Harris is driven by his support for technological advancements and cybersecurity, both of which Harris has championed."
"But when it comes to the presidential race, understand that in Pennsylvania, maybe looking at sort of on a football field, you can maybe get 49 yards up your side of the field."

"Harris must present a compelling economic vision that not only appeals to urban voters, but also resonates deeply with rural constituents who may be experiencing significant economic distress."

"Well, look, Jessica, in Pennsylvania, the last two presidential races have come down to 44,000 votes in 80,000 votes, representing about a point or less."
Fair enough.
The race is still too close to call and the Harris campaign is deploying its big guns to help seal the deal.
"Look, I think it's a it's a valid concern."
"And we see some pretty similar patterns, whether we're talking about the national polling or the swing state polling, where Harris, like Biden, is running pretty close to what Biden got in his winning number in 2020 among white voters, maybe a little below where he was among whites without a college degree, maybe a little above where he was among whites with a college degree and netting out to about the same place."
Why is he traveling to central Pennsylvania?
"So, yeah."
But what's going to happen is this is what people say when they answer the polls.
This just goes to show how complex and global the implications of this election are.
"And just that's the John Peterman's unit man, Charlie Moly."
"Terry, forgive me, we have a little bit of breaking news that I just want to get in here, which is that before he took that stage behind you, former President Trump did an interview with Fox News and he gave his clearest answer yet on how he would vote on his home state's ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights into that state constitution and essentially repeal a current Florida state law that bans abortions after six weeks, which is before most women know that they are pregnant."
And that's what they're talking about.
Jackie's politics are also rooted in family.
And it's happening at Temple University's Lea Kors Center.
Shapiro believes that Harris is the best candidate for the state.
But it all of course comes down to the key battleground states.
"The story was real because I'm guessing liberals knew the higher up Democrats knew that the story, the Hunter Biden laptop story was what the Republicans were sitting on because of course it's going to get released a few weeks before the election."
"Not looking good, okay, they talk to a lot of people."

Democrats gained just under 14000.
"These people, they're going to vote early."
That's so awesome.
"Can you tell me about that, what the campaign is saying this morning about what the former president was signaling?"
You're a lawyer yourself.
"Well, he asked if my three boys were standing right behind me, which they were."

"The three states to keep an eye on out of this are North Carolina, where Harris has a narrow lead over Trump by about two points, and then, of course, Arizona, where Harris is up by five, that New York Times-Ciena College poll shows, and then Nevada, where it's got Trump up by a few points."
Trump had 61 and a half.
"As Amar Moussa, who is leading the rapid response team for President Biden explained that in the 2020 election, Pennsylvania was decided by 80,000 votes."
I'm excited to hear that both of you are voting.
The candidates are tied also in battleground states.
How is he going to fix that?
And it just goes to show trying to predict how people will vote.
"Republicans have consistently argued that there are vulnerabilities in the electoral system that need to be addressed, while many Democrats have countered that such measures can disenfranchise voters and create unnecessary barriers to participation."
I think Oz is more of a grifter.
"OK. Well, fracking is really an important part of natural gas delivery."
Me too.

"The reason for that is is that if former President Donald Trump takes back Arizona and Georgia where his numbers are good, this proverbial blue wall that you have up here is so critical."
I doubt it.
You guys are living in a real dump.
They don't like the Medicaid program.
They have acknowledged that there are some potential plans to see if the Trump ticket will come to Reading but no specific timeline on when that might happen.
I'm seeing it in rooms and union halls in my district.

"It's just another example of him making it about himself as opposed to the service and sacrifice in this case, true sacrifice of others."

That's why.

"He's been active in politics in that area for almost 60 years, and he has a lot of deep roots that he can call on for extra support for Kamala Harris in a state that might be decided, Laura, by maybe 10,000 votes or less."
She says she wouldn't change anything.
We welcome everybody and we're here to show that support today.
"So I think a lot of that was just petty politics, unfortunately."
It is right.
"The outcome in Pennsylvania could very well determine the next president, making it a battleground state that will continue to draw national attention."
Follow me on social media.
"We have ourselves, Reading Police as well here."

Pennsylvania I just talked about it was around 81 K votes.
The Trump led by five.

You look at Morning Compost like they're in the mix and they are a horrendous pollster with an awful track record.
"And even if they would still fall short, I'd rather have Trump fall short with somebody good and have the week end up winning the primary, than have Trump endorse the week and have them win the primary by a resounding margin."
"But I think one thing to put on full display was while you have Trump, who's openly hostile and whose project 2025 seeks to eliminate the Department of Education, you have what you've done in P.A."
It's all on this now.
"Because Trump in Wisconsin, very hard to poll just because he's got that unique driftless area base that pollsters typically end up missing."
But voters that we spoke to say that they are excited about the potential of a Harris and Shapiro ticket.
This poll is within the margin of error.

"So when you look, we'll start west in the Pittsburgh area, that's Allegheny County."
I don't wanna vote.
"It was the first time I'm like, I'm happy I don't live in a swing state, because I don't think I could handle this, because even if you don't want to engage with it and you don't watch terrestrial TV, it's on the radio, the yard signs are everywhere."

I think it's fair to say Trump lies more in Kamala Harris.
"What this is focused on, though, these efforts or this talk of the former president wanting to repeal this Act 77, this is an act that was passed in 2019, which was before the pandemic, that allowed for no excuse absentee voting, which means that anybody could vote by mail."

You want to take a look at Westmoreland County.

So those Republicans that don't love Trump.

"And Pennsylvania, again, doesn't stand alone in this characterization."
"Think back to the primaries this year, even after Nikki Haley exited the race, she was still getting a sizable portion of voters in the suburbs, places like here in the suburbs of Philadelphia."

"But one thing I'll say overall, Lindsay, is that Republicans and Democrats, both of them agree, maybe not on the record for Democrats, a lot of them privately will say this, but they do think the Senate is probably gone, that Republicans are very likely to flip the chamber."

"Dasha is joining us now and Dasha, Mr. Trump is next heading to a battleground where he's playing defense."
He then attacks President Biden for calling Pennsylvania a state.
But it would be malpractice to abandon making these points about the kind of fundamental threat that Trump poses to democracy.
"Remember in 2016, how we were so racist."
Kamala Harris doesn't exactly have that point of strength.
Shapiro is strong.

Donald Trump then wants the crowd to know he is not cognitively impaired.

"The four-point swing has, in fact, narrowed down Pennsylvania quite tremendously, and the three recent polls here are tremendous ones for Kamala Harris's campaign, because they show a consistency, a consistency that we hadn't seen in Pennsylvania for quite some time, unless it was predicting that Joe Biden was losing the state to Donald Trump."
"There's what Trump says, and then there's easily observable reality."
"Look, this is a state where the economy is usually the centerpiece of the argument in both presidential races and Senate races."
Ohio.
Kamala don't know.
We've covered what was happening in primaries across the country.
What we can see here is Pennsylvania is absolutely dead heat as well.
That's insane.
Of course the citizens and the residents of course they will be benefit from this lower the grocery price.
"You have candidates to vote for in this election who demonstrate character, who know what real strength looks like, who will set a good example and will do the right thing and lead this country better than they found it."
And just wondering if this raises any other concerns about election security.
This is a very winnable election for Trump.
These other people are coming in and they're affecting the school systems and they're affecting the hospital system.
"Recent polls showed Trump and Harris are neck and neck in the seven swing states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina."

"So more as well, we have Poly Market here now."
"All right All the way up the hill there check that out All these people y'all look at that But then you have people at a Kamala's all Talk about Kamala's rallies Trump don't have nobody yet, man."
I just sit back and watch it all play out.
And they got Kamala Harris.
This is the most important state in the 2024 election.
And then we have the dissenter.
"Another morning consult poll conducted on the same dates shows Harris at 49% and Trump at 46%, a solid three point lead for Harris."

It's a very good thing.
"Well, the Harris campaign says that they are in, quote, more aggressive phase of the campaign since the debate."
"And their basic argument is, look at the guy who actually is there, not the guy that you have nostalgia for for the pre-COVID economy."
Spot the green.
And this looks very good.
"If somebody says, well, I'm thinking about voting for Trump because I remember the economy being pretty good, remind him why it was good."
That's sacrifice.
I would have to go with the economy.
"No, I don't have money for emergencies."
So he's trying to pre-butt that a little bit and to lean into an issue where he has an advantage right now.
Let me show you a couple of things.
"And so I think Kamala Harris really narrowing down this state too, also has now been translated to some of the political betting market odds."
Unbelievable.
"It was mostly Trump, just huge leads for Joe."

But those are the ones we're waiting on right now.
"Because every time a Democrat outperforms in a special election, it's definitive."
"I'd say the best for last, guys."
They tend to be microcosms of the state.
"OK, so Canada, Kamala Harris will be back in Pennsylvania for the second time this week."
We most certainly still feel that way.
Trump is going to be strong in Pennsylvania.
She was supposed to have won Pennsylvania in 2016.
And those two people that went down are patriots and we love them.
"We've got two months to go before November 5th, and that essentially means that there's opportunities to persuade some people."
"And then another thing the campus is doing that's pissing me off is she's trying to, she's trying to be everything to everybody."

"Tonight, Casey and McCormick meeting on stage for their first debate, as the new poll of the battleground shows Casey ahead, but still within the margin of error."

"Vance is set to host a press conference in South Philadelphia at the 2300 Arena, where he's expected to talk about the economy and immigration."
Maybe he doesn't understand.
They won't completely discount her.
"And so being down again, 5.6 percent also means that the unfavorability rating has now dropped below 50 percent, meaning the majority of the nation no longer views Kamala Harris as unfavorable."
Am I worried about that?
And you don't even have there's nothing like outdoors.
Do you think the election of 2020 was stolen?
Quinnipiac.
"Just like Juicy Smee talking about, uh, these two quite retinics, it's Maga country in Chicago, in the polar vortex for real."
"Jenny, thanks so much for being here with us today."
"In this one, Kamala Harris leads with 48% of the vote, while Donald Trump trails with 46%."
"So this is in line with what you would expect, and when you look at it, Donald Trump, among those definitely voting close to 50%, this is a brutal poll for Joe Biden out of Pennsylvania."
"It appears that there is a disconnect between the Kamala camp and the DNC, but first let me say today's schedule may be a little bit on the wonky side."
"So Laura, when the Vice President says we have to earn every vote, what does that look like for the Harris campaign in this post-debate phase?"
"Because if Democrats were in fact gaining a real surge, I'm not talking about an artificial one being pushed by the media."
None of it affected his trajectory.

What a pile of crap.
And we're going to work like hell to make sure we elect Tim Waltz and Kamala Harris as the next president and vice president in November.
"And I remember being here at the anchor desk, watching that live and the shock as it happened, given that he is returning to this rally."

"They can't just ignore it, right?"
And the people that are making these decisions are not a lot of women.
Who do you think won the 2020 election?
I wish that we would break the mold of what we've had.
So either Wisconsin's numbers are way off or Pennsylvania's numbers are way off.
That is even the bigger.
"It was also friends and coworkers and neighbors, and even political opponents, people on the other side of the aisle."
Nobody in this room has been listening to the analysis We've actually all been talking amongst ourselves.
Are we seeing the same for down ballot races or do you expect either Harris or Trump to do worse than their congressional counterparts on the ballot?
Did God protect Pulse Nightclub?
I'm out of here in January anyway.
He he's from Pennsylvania.
Where you already had a lot of Democrats switched to voting in person.
"So today, we're about to react to Obama slayers Trump for hurricane misinformation at campaign rally in Pennsylvania for Harris."
We got boonies HQ.
"And that all changed in 2016 when the coalition started to change, where you saw the Republican party start to embrace and bring on the blue collar voter who either was a Democrat or an independent or middle of the road Republican."

"Despite all the dooming surrounding Pennsylvania, Trump is in a very good position to win it."
"I mean, look at those numbers there within the margin of error."

"So let's talk about these issues with Nnedia, who's traveling with the Harris campaign."
"Looking at the graph, we can see that it is a highly contested battle between Harris and Trump."
Silver's model also predicts that Harris has an 88.8% chance of winning the entire election if she takes Pennsylvania.
He couldn't go up there and talk about public education because he doesn't believe in the institution of public education.
So it shows kind of that target group in a state that is completely up for grabs.

It depends on us.
"It doesn't help with Obama, what he just did."
Let's swing on over here and we'll bring in our next guest to give us our best analysis coming our way.
What do you think of this policy right now?
It could be a while.
" Well, ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump got a major victory in the state of Pennsylvania within the last 24 hours that could single handedly change the results of the election."
Explain why she's doing that and how it fits into the context of what we heard last week from former President Barack Obama.

"Politico, they outright admitted that the Harris operation in Pennsylvania is a complete shit show."
But Shapiro signs shells to be used in the war in Ukraine.
"So that's why I believe while this number is more than likely inflated, I still think these are good numbers for the GOP."
But here is Harris with a decidedly different rhetorical approach to this age old question that we get from the Beltway Press.
"President Biden said, you see the photos right there."
47% voted for Donald Trump.
"I mean, this is about as close as it gets."
 Be careful what you ask for.

"And as we've seen in polling, Trump still is doing better than Harris and some polls when it comes to the economy and the majority of polls."

Democrats 50 Republicans won.
Trump held a massive 36-point advantage over Biden in rural areas.

And I think that Trump's decision to pick Vance as his running mate signals that that's kind of where he wants the party to move.
This is according to a CBS News poll.
"As you've already talked about, I believe in what we can create in terms of opportunity for the American people as they did in the opportunity economy."
"I mean, he's well known in Pennsylvania, which is one of those states that they wanna be able to carry."
We're thrilled to be able to support what we see is a wonderful leader for this country.
She's been loyal so far but she's going to cut her own path.
"After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from election day, is not the moment to make this change, McDonnell said."
"It awards 40 electoral votes, only behind California's 54."
"Lindsey, there's no question both these campaigns view Pennsylvania as nearly a must-win state, but these two places they've gone on opposite corners in the northwest corner and in the southeast corner are very different areas."
"I know hindsight is 2020, but looking back at it now, any idea what happened?"
"I like how literally everyone who said, guys, Biden is not going to win."
Like dead people voting in Philadelphia.
I really appreciate you.
"Well, here's the deal."
Why hasn't that changed?
We're gearing up.
"I mean, I think that is very, very healthy."
"He uses Latinos poor Trump, right?"
We get to do something about it.
That ends today.
We just... That's all we can tell you.
"Governor Tim Walz, a former teacher and veteran, offers a grounded and relatable perspective to the political landscape."
" Coming down to the wire, presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is spending her Sunday meeting with the top contenders to be her running mate."
Three other young Republican groups never responded at all.
"Alright, that's all for today's update."
So this just builds more and more on to what the Democrats can do in the November election.
That's not good.
President Joe Biden is headlining the Philadelphia Democratic Party's get out the vote dinner tonight in South Philadelphia.
Is this something they're going to support?
"What I find interesting, though, is that at the same time that one hundred fifty seven thousand voters are still voting for Haley."
And that is Kamala Harris and Tim Walts.
The reason they did that was because that's the purest form of propaganda.
There you go from inside.
"Okay, so the big one, the one that's all over social media, speculation about motive."
"Social media, however, they can get a little hairy."
I love this.
"More concerning was the fact that the impromptu music concert unfolded after two of the audience members fainted due to the heat, whom the ex-president called patriots."
"Obviously, what's so shocking about that?"
Trump on through social is calling on voters here to get out and vote saying quote if you have a ballot return it immediately and if not go vote at the polls right now.
We need you out there.
And it was that Dr. Oz that beat him out.
How do you t be in this first rally?
I'll see you in the next one.
It's pretty crazy what Bill Clinton saying.
"Well, as things went on, I became a die-hard Donald Trump fan."
"Degan, can you explain the difference?"
But Trump's solid base in Florida's Hispanic community keeps him firmly in the game.
New polls were shared after the last polls in which Harris achieved great success.
She was all in then.
They are some of the most accurate pollsters in this entire nation.
We're still a retail state.
They have a Trump plus three.
Is he our pet?
"So I'm from Trumbull County, which is adjacent to Mahoney County, which always voted blue and flipped red in 2016 ain't going back."
He did not put as much effort into it as a lot of these other candidates who are basically vying for second did and Trump won at the end of the day.
"She would answer it, but then she would quickly pivot and almost bait Donald Trump into speaking about another issue."
"If she loses the election, she's not going to claim it was rigged."
I represent a new generation of leadership.
That's where they think they can make the most headway.
And I think that might tell us something.
Has a lot of people.
It didn't work out.
I like to call him Coach Walz.
"Yeah, I mean, if you're trying to engage misogynists a few weeks before the election, you're wasting your time."
"But beyond that point, it's it's crazy to see."
Loud and clear.
The visit was more than just a stop on the campaign trail.
I'm not going to go too deep because they didn't want their face to be all over the place.
"And so you saw earlier up here, it's not just the Latinos, Latinx community that they're struggling with, maybe because they keep calling them Latinx."
Are they even worth paying attention to or are they just going to make us more anxious?
And eventually that he failed when it went up against Federman.
"Russell Wilson, I think, is a veteran quarterback who can do good things."
"Their message of unity, progress, and opportunity resonated with Pennsylvanians looking for leadership that reflects their values and aspirations."
Southern Pennsylvania.
"You look at Pennsylvania, your home state, and you say Democrats are trying to defend their turf."
No insurance is needed.
Nathaniel was showing us the polls just super tight between former President Trump and Vice President Harris.
That's what it's all about.
People remain here for long stretches of time.
You take care.
None of this is a surprise.
But Kamala Harris had a bump going into her convention.
" something really, really, really, really, really weird happened yesterday."
But obviously Gallup is really good when it comes to the party ID coinciding with the national popular vote.
"I'm just getting information right now, but it does appear that a Biden supporter snuck into the Donald Trump rally with about 50,000 people in Butler, Pennsylvania."
"So while the national and even statewide polling in some states has gotten worse for Trump, it seems like in Pennsylvania, it stayed about the same."
And why are white people not talking about white or white crime?
Has Donald Trump up three?
"This being the result in Wisconsin actually is not really all that bad, all things considered."
" Rain or shine, they showed up for President Trump tonight in Western Pennsylvania and it was pouring rain."
She is doing worse than Biden.
Is that what motivates you to come back here?
"He did good in box, Montgomery and Chester."
Could be inclement weather.
I think everybody is waiting for the next debate.
It's traditional Republicans.
Can the Democratic presidential nominee and her running mate Tim Walz ride the vibes to victory in Arizona and on to the White House?
We don't let anybody just walk through our homes.
It's been floated for years by various Republicans.
She saw Pennsylvania.
It'll be my third election.
I'm not leaving.
"And they are so well aware that even though this area in particular voted for President Biden back in 2020, there is plenty of opportunity for her to lose, which is why she's trying to meet face to face with as many people as she can to try to get her message across."
"And now they're arguing that, that Donald Trump, I guess kept everything closed and had the unemployment."
What is this shirt here?
I wouldn't necessarily say that.
I'll put a new one in.
Leave the liberality alone.
It is a difference between day and night.
I'm Scranton Joe and the guy who had his advertisements being aired for decades upon decades in the Philadelphia media market where Delaware was.
It's a beautiful thing to see.
"By demonstrating effectiveness in achieving legal and policy goals, Trump's campaign can solidify support among Republican voters and enhance its position within the party."
"They came back, they're like, okay, we've done our investigation, and we think we could get this whole thing settled for 4.5 quadrillion dollars or something like that."
"In terms of my immediate plan, I will tell you a few of the following."
"He's picking up historic gains, and it shows Kamala Harris is on defense with these supporters that have typically been key to the Democrat Party's electoral success."
"And everybody was like, Oh, well now you see this image."
"And in between on Tuesday, Governor Tim Walz will blitz Western Pennsylvania."
"No, it's true because even Biden, he didn't win that county, Luzerne County, but he did better than Hillary did."
"Like, for example, you see LGBTQI Plus for Kamala Harris."
"But when Republicans do it, in Georgia, for example, or they do very well in terms of primary turnout in some key states, oh, no, that doesn't matter."
It was a little depressing for a while there but I'm getting very excited now.
The old cookie poll.
And I think that's one of the things that the campaign is deeply understood is that the messaging is fundamentally about the same thing.
How are you going to vote?
But look at this.
"He came from a purple district, a Trump district."
I don't know who I'm gonna vote for.
"But it is also a compact version of the whole state with urban areas like Bethlehem, lush rural farms and middle class suburbs."
"The sixth poll was conducted between September 12th and 16 by Quinnipiac University among 1,331 likely voters."
This is Trump's hood right here.
Every Jewish kid wanted to grow up being black.
"That means affordable housing, a living wage and reproductive freedom."
"He has 48.7% of the vote, but Biden's 44.7."
"Like you said, this is dead center of the state."
I will leave it to Governor Shapiro and the legal authorities to speak to this I'm just not going to speak to it from here we have to leave it to FEC.
"Vachow says his team will be targeting black, Hispanic and younger voters this cycle."
Nothing to do with me.
And that was a telling sign that's sure Joe Biden may not have been the right guy to meet the moment today.
Here's my I am running and we're going to win.
It'll go over so well.
Voter fraud is widespread.
"Do you remember the first threat that made you go, I've got to take this one seriously?"
"And he goes, yeah, no."
What do you make of them?
"But listen, you know, these races are closed, James."
"It's really, I think, insulting people in an election like this when so much is on the line."
"And in the United States, there's a pretty big push by some groups and politicians to end the use of fossil fuels."
"On the other hand, the Democratic Party may face increased pressure to address concerns about election security and to articulate their position on these issues more clearly."
This is another example of it.
You type in MSNBC.
Even Harris plus five.
The variation in polling data across different areas reflects the state's diverse political landscape.
"He's running for Senate in Pennsylvania and hopes to ride that Trump wave to victory on May 17th, just as J.D."
D Vance will also be in South Philly that day.
"Meanwhile, Andrzej Duda is meeting with Polish Americans, emphasizing their role in building American policy, extremely important for Poland today."
"And guys, look, even if you're a MAGA, if you didn't think that he was a lunatic before, you really think that Donald Trump at 78 300 some odd pounds is better looking than Kamala Harris."
"But I think what you really need to see on an economic message is something that speaks to the middle class, strengthens our union jobs and our unions in general."
I feel it right now.
So similar margin of victory in Pittsburgh.
Probably two or is that everybody?
That suggests a deep cultural rot in the country and Donald Trump is reflecting that.
"I mean, where were you standing again?"
That means we don't know how the election is going to go and it could change so much from now to election day.
I really don't think a plurality of people say abortion at all in any other group.
That is really at the forefront of what I'm hearing from particularly young women voters on college campuses.
"Well, if Donald Trump would have listened to Democrats, they would have lost triple quadruple the amount of jobs."
"And this is one of the absolute, you know, battleground states, right?"
"And it looks like 98% of the votes are in, 99% of the votes are in, but such a massive margin of those 1% outstanding votes were actually blue."
"He's tough as hell David, I know you just spoke just cover your sake like for two seconds because nobody wants to hear you right now."
Let's talk about a couple of battleground states.
"Both campaigns are looking to reach former president Trump after spending the weekend doubling down with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and suggesting he would use the military against his foes tonight, turning to the economy as well."
It doesn't make any sense.
"Somebody said, look, we used to be able to have a decent living on 40,000 a year."
The 2024 election is shaping up to be incredibly tight.
Donald Trump was speaking at an NRA event on Friday night.
Are they perfect?
"Well, there are concerns."
Every Monday and Thursday only on First Post.
Tim Walz is a great man.
Kamala Harris received 52 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 48 percent.
But he has that background.
It's also a place that George W. Bush did well.
I don't think that quite matters anymore.
" Beth Leeper is a small business owner, former dairy farmer, and current beef and crops farmer from Westmoreland County."
"Kamala Harris is too exotic to flip Pennsylvania on her face Also the California problem People hate California And the Republicans are going to say over and over again Turn America into California They're going to turn America into California They're going to turn America into California You're going to hear that so many times Between now and election day If she is the nominee Because she's not yet the nominee But if she is You're going to hear that from now until election day And it is going to be effective Because when people think of California They think of queer folks They think of a lot of stuff that ain't true like violence And California has one of the lowest gun death rates in America California is not wild crime, out of control crime It's not California is very safe Los Angeles with all them gangbangers Is safer than Memphis or Atlanta or even Oakland LA is pretty sick California in general You don't feel threatening anywhere in California That's kind of how it is I'm sure, you know, there's some rougher hoods But I'm here to sing California's praises I have nothing against Kamala Harris or Gavin Newsom In that regard I'm a West Coast liberal But America, my folks back in Pennsylvania Them rednecks They ain't going to turn out for her She's not going to push the white women out in the Philly and Pittsburgh suburbs She's not They will stay loyal to Trump Because they will look at her as competition and not as an ally Think about this as the workplace In the workplace When it comes down to making those executive decisions and hiring the manager There's always a preference Always So to be a black person Or to be somebody who's non-white And to become management or executives or president of the United States You have to surpass the bar By so many miles It's not funny And Kamala just doesn't do it She's not Barack Obama She's not That's my only knock against her I have nothing against the woman personally I think she's a great politician I think she would be a great president But I know this country Especially my home state And so I'm here to warn the Democratic party I'm here to warn the Congressional Black Caucus It's okay to support her There's nothing wrong with supporting her But if you all don't have a fair and open process to test her candidacy If she cannot wrangle the delegates Between now and convention time in five weeks She doesn't deserve to be your nominee She doesn't And why would you hold on to her out of some what?"
"He said fight, fight, fight, fight, fight."
They want an improved surrogate operation.
"And they certainly don't like when I say, hey, I won't vote for your tax cuts for big companies and billionaires, but they also don't like when I'm criticizing these big companies on grief."
So I imagine that we will kind of get all of the above when it comes to the former president's remarks.
I love people.
"Just yesterday, I got a call from a cousin who informed me that his sister-in-law was just obliterated to pieces."
They're specifically targeting Rust Belt states.
And this is a place where Democrats have done poorly.
"That's why it's a big freaking deal that oh, yeah, we're not looking good at Pennsylvania based on the Eternals and not only that just public polling is bad."
"It is me, Real American, back again with a new video."
And it does seem as if Harris is in a much weaker position than these individuals.
"We need a president who actually cares about solving problems, making your life better."
"Yeah, Barry, it definitely seems no matter what side you're on, everyone is unhappy."
"But when you look at the early vote numbers, it looks like a disaster."
"But who are you, by the way?"
The Washington Post reported Sunday Moscow and Kiev were set to send delegations to Qatar this month to negotiate a landmark agreement halting strikes on energy and power infrastructure on both sides.
Obviously it was one of the closest states in 2020.
And Harris beats Trump in this poll by three points.
I suppose.
"Then over in Wisconsin, out of the core swing states this cycle, Biden's numbers were surprisingly the strongest here before he dropped out."
That's another way of saying that's a lie.
This November is seen as crucial for expressing these desires.
Now President Barack Obama did agree that the 2024 election is much closer than anticipated.
It's like it's ridiculous like you're not getting anything You're not going anywhere.
It's time that we just keep making sure we improve and grow this community together.
I miss several others.
Both sides are trying to court key activists and officials in Pennsylvania.
"And look at the split here, just in general."
"So really, that was a big swing towards President Biden."
"All of a sudden, all these people who were always, you know what I'm saying, every night on deck is the worst people in the world."
The tenth poll was conducted between September 1st and 25 by active vote among 400 likely voters.
He's been so well spoken with the media.
I appreciate the opportunity to talk.
And it's all total gaslighting because originally Trump opened up everything too soon.
So they can at least take on some culpability.
"Honestly, no."
It was crazy.
It is you just tuning in.
"He says, Kamala's face."
"And that's what the media is looking at, is the comparisons between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's numbers this time around, when that was a complete anomaly of a year given the pandemic."
"He is us, and we are him."
And both Barry and Dan are joining us live from there with more on what the voters had to say.
So but the local police are patrolling that.
"If it's a consistent trend like it's been, that's a big deal."
"We reached out to the Arizona GOP who's expressed their support for Trump, but we did not hear back."
"They were in Reading, Pennsylvania."
But the good news is that Kamala Harris does not have concepts of a plan.
And I want to play that part for our audience.
"They genuinely or at least want to put this out there so their audience gets placated, oh, Biden's still in the lead."
"And besides all that, he almost just ruined our democratic process."
This obsession with Hollywood and celebrities shows a side of Trump that is more concerned with personal grudges than political leadership.
"While each state has its unique political dynamics, they all share a history of being fiercely contested battlegrounds."
Knows it inside and out.
And that turned out not to be true what he was saying.
That's exactly what I've been expecting.
Share your predictions in the comments below.
"But for now, live in Johnstown, Brock Owens, 6 News."
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
We don't even have evidence to suggest that is true yet.
So here we have Trump at plus three in Arizona.
"I pointed this out some time ago, especially with incumbency."
"What you're hearing now in this election that's different is I have been the first to say and I put so in my op ed, the transformative policies of President Biden are likened to those of Lyndon B. Johnson or FDR."
"You do also have North Carolina, Georgia, and then you do have to win Arizona and Wisconsin."
Several shots were heard.
"And I think that as you go, I want to tell people, Celine and I grew up about the same age and we grew up about 50 miles apart."
"But just also her record, you know, she isn't like this Catholic larper like Biden was who would never let people forget about it."
There's no denying that Pennsylvania is the key to this election.
"However, we are still months away from the election, and the polling data can shift."
Never done a day of hard labor in his life.
"Oh, right."
You know what would actually help bring order to the border and actually help fix our immigration system?
Cooper's donation reflects his belief that Harris' leadership is crucial to solving the nation's housing challenges.
Her campaign is based upon lies about President Trump.
Ain't nobody here voting for Kamala Harris.
I made a commitment during my campaign that I was going to appoint a pro-democracy Secretary of State.
From the streets you can tell that a lot of people are saying so many reasons some are saying it is staged some are saying you will start having like a victim now because of the situation and start you know you start having like a victim of gun violence some are saying they hope that it's not a black person because if it's a black person like it's done I just want like it's really really done.
I appreciate you brother.
And so part of what you do in a campaign is you take your message out there to the voters.
The legal victory in Pennsylvania can also help consolidate support among Republicans.
"So Reince Priebus, the convention committee chair, also a former Trump administrator, chief of staff, said on a Saturday night that the event was going to, was going ahead with guests already beginning to arrive in Wisconsin."
"And just considering all these things swirling around here, Mike, a lot of times the real world, the best laid plans."
We're forced to provide full coverage right here on ABC News Live all day long.
What's the feeling if you could describe it in like a word or two?
"And now that Biden has a record to run against, Vachow is also hoping to win back some suburbanites who told him in 2020 they were turned off by Trump's personality."
You said the poll to your point.
And that's really all that matters because we have pretty much enough voters already in the country to win.
It's very very close.
"And listen, we broke the national record for the lowest unemployment rate in the history of the United States of America because people in South Dakota understand we were created to serve each other."
"So Wisconsin does tilt blue here, and it does track with the overall average in Wisconsin that is Harris up exactly 3 points over Trump, based on a full 20-poll average."
That's a county that voted for President Obama twice.
"You were sitting on the stage while President Obama was in Pittsburgh, and there was a point there where he talked about you and said, you ain't no show pony."
It was it was nine million barrels a day under Trump.
"I know Bucks County, it's suburban Philadelphia."
That bill was for 180 police officers to patrol inside and outside the TCC Center for six and a half hours.
"The two counties to watch in Pennsylvania are North Hampton County, my old district, is the ultimate bellwether county in the state and perhaps the nation and Erie County."
I don't know how you live in America.
And then walk us through how you do it.
They're accused of taking part in a scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona.
My sister had it all documented and everything.
MAGA folks are the ones who are taking money from Russia and Trump continues to boost these MAGA votes.
"Now, the reason why this issue is even in the hands of states to decide is because Trump-appointed Supreme Court justices took away that constitutional right back in 2022."
They don't like her.
Because they know that those candidates are going to hurt their candidate camel.
I don't understand this outreach crap that they're doing.
So the cost of beef went up 5 to 6%.
But Pennsylvania Kamala Harris.
"Now, what the electoral votes are, what is going to decide this election?"
It's malleable.
I hate to say this because I say it all the time.
And I imagine they're going to simulcast it.
"And I think Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania is a must win state."
"But in a presidential year, it's a little bit different and that we know."
We have to understand there's going to be less mail in voting in 2024.
Give us a sense of how the state has voted in the past flipping from between red and blue.
"Look, Wolf, this election could very well be decided by which candidate better articulates an economic message."
What does that tell you?
"And I think if he articulates his message well, he stays on point."
"The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, said, no one has ever been more dangerous to this country than Donald Trump, and he is a fascist to his core."
"So if it wasn't for a single pollster, which Bloomberg has done this like five times the cycle, every time there's a stretch of bad polling out of the blue, Bloomberg releases a Harris plus five in Pennsylvania, Harris plus 12 in Michigan, it's a pile of crap."
"And the Democrat in 2022 that got their ass kicked got 90,000 votes in 2022."
And this is so far our prediction.
Transitor.
Maybe we'll pay off the $35 trillion in crypto.
That's who Bob Casey is.
"Yeah, probably not."
"I think folks saw the way Donald Trump did that job, which is why we kicked him out of office after four years."
And I think one of the things that's been really top of mind in this election cycle is reproductive rights and specifically access to abortion.
"And I decided, you know what?"
"That said, this is Pennsylvania and so many of these states, just like the country, so closely divided."
Biden can't sink.
So the campaign is certainly trying to find ways for her to continue to message on this.
I think that's the basic sentiment.
I have.
"That's the big news of this episode, how the media is turning on Kamala Harris for the first time in the last couple of days."
The waves would be crashing into my face.
So all my Puerto Ricans.
"They're fighting still, Laura, over whether or not the microphones will be turned off when it is no longer the candidate's time to speak."
Why you voting for Trump?
He doesn't get it.
"So I find it very interesting that the Biden campaign, they're launching this six figure ad by, you know, where they highlight Trump essentially slamming Haley over and over again."
That's why early on they had such a big lead and right now they actually have a decent sized advantage.
"And now there are Trump abortion bans in 20 states, many of them with no exceptions for rape and incest."
How did people respond?
"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision is critical because it mandates that all mail-in ballots must be signed and dated by voters, and they must be returned within a specified timeframe."
He's a whole human being.
"Again, some of that is going to be because there were more Democrats that were afraid of the pandemic."
"So be warned, turn it off right now."
Like bring healthy choices back.
But Trump is not backing down.
"No, we can't believe that even you are saying this."
I see one little one.
It's possible.
"In fact, they look at Pennsylvania."
"Of course, the talking heads on the media, that's where they live, which is why they live in a bubble."
We've seen what he won't sign.
At the top left of the screen there's also a Discord server if you go ahead and join.
And I think that that we are over focusing on those numbers.
"It's a slow decline, but the thing about it is they are not going to do anything that's going to benefit black people."
And both campaigns are urging their supporters to turn out in record numbers.
"Hell yeah, gas down to 290 a gallon."
"Obviously, Trump did better than, you know, Mitt Romney significantly in those areas."
"They write the book, right?"
Registration is part number one.
Another factor to consider is the enthusiasm gap.
"If MSNBC reported more like CNN, and this is not an endorsement of the fairness of CNN, although I will tell you I do not over and over again see CNN hosts banging away at Trump's dictator with spittle flying from their mouths the same way I do on MSNBC."
"You reconstruct it, so to speak."
Both candidates are descending on Pennsylvania Monday.
"Kamala Harris received 45% of the vote and Donald Trump, 48%."
That's how it happened.
"So even if these states are becoming more politically diverse, those changes could really shake things up in the electoral college, right?"
"And of course, cross tabs are a little wonky in all polls."
" We are just 22 days away from election day, and Vice President Harris and former President Trump are campaigning in the same battleground state today."
So 58% are not approving of Snippy Joe.
But the consequences of him ever being president again are brutally serious.
Decisive.
"Because if you say you value human rights, public safety, the truth, but you're willing to set them aside for what you think will be lower taxes and less federal red tape or whatever other benefits you expect to get from a Trump administration versus a Harris administration, if you're willing to set all of those values aside for those things, I don't think you really value those things at all."
"For someone who has, um, you know, sort of claims to be doing good, but actually he's not, you know, he is tearing down the fabric of society."
"And that really speaks volumes, even though Donald Trump was getting outspent in the primary in a lot of places."
And so I also encourage us not to overread into this moment.
So to me the only thing that I'm worried about in this current moment is whether that shooter was a person of color or not because if that shooter is a person of color.
"I think you were looking at the final three, none of them were really particularly that appealing."
Must win.
"However, Trump's having difficulty sticking to that message."
"You know, we saw it when he was talking about Barack Obama."
"Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis."
George Stephanopoulos here.
Will be at the heart of this contest.
So you look at this and all around does seem like Republicans did well in Nevada.
"Okay, a relatively smallish county that we're all going to be watching and obsessed with on election night this year, Erie County in 2016."
And this is a sample?
"Kind of everybody just kind of say what you want to hear, so to me it's just really hard because it's what they really do when they're elected."
"I think by the end of this, I'm going to win my race."
He mentioned that perhaps he should revoke CBS broadcasting license.
Forty seven versus six for Harris.
That's not true.
And Pennsylvania has been relatively deadlocked for weeks now at roughly tie.
"Harris also addressed the economic struggles of working families, outlining her plan to lower costs and provide more opportunities for Americans to thrive."
You think Donald Trump can do that?
And what the next 50 some odd days will do is allow her to get out on the campaign trail and share those priorities directly with the American people.
"And that can signal that the Republicans are at least again, gaining maybe 20 or 30,000."
The sample size is 1331.
I think that creating that sense of a community amongst voters to get them engaged and get them out to the polls is going to be super important.
"You've got Democrats, business leaders, military leaders, former Republicans were able to fill rooms even if Kamala Harris is not there in Pennsylvania to let people know what is at stake and why they should rally around Kamala Harris."
So there has to be some Biden in this campaign.
"And this just shows you that Trump is opening up the economy and helping jobs, man, all time high when he was in office."
That is a very interesting dynamic to watch and whether that gap closes as we get closer.
"Wow, it's hot out."
So we're going to go.
"This deep dive has been kind of a whirlwind, to be honest."
They are Republican leading voters that more than likely they're going to break for Trump.
You've campaigned across Pennsylvania and you've gone to places like Somerset County where Donald Trump won by 56 points four years ago.
"Maybe he sees him as the lesser of two evils, but he'll endorse him anyways because of my eloped ability."
"As such, they are now considered firmly Republican-leaning, and while we don't yet have a poll between Trump and Harris and Iowa, the latest survey in Ohio has Trump up 10 points over Harris 52% to 42% among 600 likely voters."
"You could say he can win, but the probability is definitely in Trump's favor."
But I was just wondering if you wouldn't mind taking us back to when you first ran and what made you run?
"Trump has two very straightforward paths to victory that do not require sweeping swing States, North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania."
"When I talk about garbage and collecting garbage, I'm talking about going on Teemu and buying everything that's under $2."
"I can tell you every marble, but these beautiful columns that are incredible how they could have done it years ago without the powerful tractors."
He let me down.
"Speaking to the crowd at Butler, Elon Musk said that only Donald Trump could save democracy in America."
"But right now she is still very much in a position she was in yesterday and the day before, which is being on track for victory and on track for an Electoral College win that could be even bigger than Joe Biden's that's yet to be seen, but not at all out of the realm of possibility 10 weeks ago that was never even in the books."
He can do no wrong even though he does.
And the stakes cannot be higher.
You have this amazing new podcast with Crooked Media.
"Well, listen, these entry level jobs, these are people that get technical degrees as mechanics or welders."
"All we can say is he jumped back up, raised his fist in the air."
"So I have to do them for, you know, my Trump girls."
Dictators are weak because they can't get elected of their own regard.
I'm proud to co-chair black voters for Kamala Harris here in Pennsylvania.
"I just don't see how you lose Pennsylvania or win Pennsylvania, but somehow lose the presidency at that point."
You're deep in it.
So I do not have a lot of credentials to interpret this from that perspective.
His campaign is particularly focused on regions where industries like coal and manufacturing are vital.
The same thing goes for Wisconsin.
"For example, you mentioned Pennsylvania."
"There are 80,000 truckers in Pennsylvania alone."
No question about it.
They might have Trump up again.
"We have to you know, take a look ourselves But you know and there's there's constantly all these You know rumors flying about the private deliberations between the two leaders and the fraught relationship that they have so that is tentative if true Yes That's a you know somewhat of a relief I would say for US officials that were pressing that both privately and of course as we heard from Biden in public Much to the dismay of some Israeli officials who didn't want to be instructed on how to conduct this retaliation So it does I think relieve a little bit of pressure But I think we have to be reminded that this isn't you know, everything is is all good between the two powers there They're allies You know the US is at pains to continue to say, you know This is all for Israel's defense as you heard from Hagar Shemali You know, this is to send a message in addition to actually provide the resources needed to finish this war But you know, there will still be disagreements And I think the US has been honest about that even in public that you know They don't always agree and they're being candid with each other Which the subtext is, you know, this isn't a great relationship a warming of ties But it is something that they both sides want to move forward and finish this off Well, we certainly have seen a market reaction to the reporting from the Washington Post oil futures are down more than 4% Right now WTI lower by nearly five full percentage points south of seventy two dollars a barrel once again So when we consider the political impact here for the Biden administration Why they had been encouraging a less escalatory move from Israel not going after energy or nuclear sites for example It was because of concern about how Iran could respond and disrupt potentially global energy markets right or at least a factor and stability Has been the name of the game since you know a year ago when the October 7th attacks happened It's a US desperately just wants to bring down the temperature and in any way we can on all these fronts You know, of course, we've got Hezbollah with defeat of Hamas All you know in the balance now oil is a significant portion of this story and you can see as you mentioned the market reaction Underscores just how sensitive these conversations are about how Israel retaliates even if the US continues to say it's justified"
There are two things that are wrong with that.

"However, there has been a recent shift in the last few weeks."
"And she goes, oh my goodness, you're the Virginia chair."
"Donald Trump was speaking to people who earned their living in this very way in Pennsylvania, far from major metropolitan areas."
"And if you watch Trump rallies, as I do a fair amount, you see he's not the candidate he was in 2020, certainly not as sharp as he was in 2016."
"A lot of it, right?"
"To run as a change candidate, you have to actually offer something different."
Whatever that means.
I think there's an emerging consensus on that.
"And if it is about the issues, then Republicans can win."
"Joe Watkins, a former White House aide to George H.W."
See you later.
"I saw Speaker Mike Johnson on Face the Nation talking about the efforts that Republicans have made to change some of the rules, in his words, to prevent election fraud, even though most folks say that there isn't widespread election fraud."
"Yeah, I'll be there."
"So we got a Suffolk poll coming out there, B rated pollster."
"He was out there camp on the road with a right wing activist, Laurel Lumer, and sort of trying to announce new policy initiatives, like something like No Taxes on Overtime, really leaning into blue collar voters."
"Now Trump appears to be having momentum with many polls moving in his direction, but one state could be make or break for both campaigns, both candidates."
"And the Harris campaign really clipped that moment, pushed it out on social media."
A sitting president on a union picket line.
"We've seen Donald Trump go to the suburbs of Harrisburg repeatedly, the suburbs of Pittsburgh repeatedly, and now he'll be in the suburbs of Philadelphia."
"Trump's message of economic nationalism, including his promises to bring back manufacturing jobs and renegotiate trade deals, resonated strongly with voters in the state in both 2016 and 2020."
The treasury candidate remained unapologetic for her comments and doubled down on her thinny veil criticisms of Shapiro in an interview with the New York Post.

"issue made up by I don't know the D.C. consulting class, the deep state, the propaganda press."
"And Donald Trump, if you look at the Venn diagram, is both a rapist and a fraudster."
We know she's not going to the Al Smith dinner.
The fluctuating voter preferences make it a battleground every election cycle.
That's a what is that a seven-point shift from 2016 compared to the polling average.
And the abortion issue is one that certainly gets people pretty riled up.
The scale of turnout in both urban and rural areas is positioned as a critical determinant of electoral success.
"Since Biden has no longer been on the ticket, that question has gone away, even though we have one of the oldest candidates running for president still on the ballot."
"And I think a lot of Americans, certainly a lot of Pennsylvanians asked themselves whether or not they want to live in a country that's going to ban abortion or not."
"Trump has earmarked the greatest share of his advertising budget for Pennsylvania's held more rallies in the state than in any other battleground since Ms. Harris joined the race, including two on Wednesday 3 in the last week."
"Are they going to be, is it going to be a Trump country?"
It's over.
"And then there was some concern in his campaign that he wasn't doing enough to win over more traditional Republicans, so-called moderate Republicans."
Because I don't want to see Trump elected after the chaos of the prior four years.
I Hope so.
" Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Senior Vice President of Business Development at Deep Well Services, John Saboe."
"But still, Biden was able to stop the bleeding."

"No, not for a second."
"He just continued to talk about what he was doing and I feel like that's what Kamala is doing for the most part because I have seen some other stuff out there, but for the most part I feel like Kamala is going on the approach of, let me just tell you what I've done and what I plan on doing versus Trump."
I hate Josh Appeiro.

These are civil rights organizations.
I do not take any.
"But all of this obviously will come down to a few hundred thousand voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that will decide the election."
And the vice president Harris is a far superior campaigner than Joe Biden.
"At least according to the polls, PA appears to be tight as can be, little to no movement at all."
And that's the kind of in your face politics that is identified with the Trump movement that I think also alienates people.

"And I really don't want to seem as if they are, treated as if they are."
That's what it was spun as as listen to the clip a million times.
"Yeah, News Nation is learning that they are expecting President Biden to jump on the campaign trail for Vice President Harris."
And I love to see the hustle.

That always works!
 And Kamala Harris are hitting the campaign trail in the battleground state of Pennsylvania today.
They reject extremism in the race for governor in the race for US Senate and in the race when Donald Trump was running for re election.

"And as Kristen said, for the most part, he did talk about economic matters, all the signage of the event that will get replayed as people see the clips are about his proposals about no taxes on tips and on Social Security and the like."
So that was a huge surprise.

Hundreds of people killed and President Biden and Vice President Harris were down there meeting with local officials and comforting families asking how they could help and Donald Trump at a rally just started making up stories about the Biden administration withholding aid from Republican areas and siphoning off aid to give to undocumented immigrants.
So I think they're underestimating his support by probably two to 3% in this situation.
How's everybody doing today?
So glad that we could get you on.
Gov.
We're probably at peak possibility for surprises right now.
Nobody is here to debate that by any means.
"Yeah, so basically after the 2020 census, Pennsylvania loses an electoral college vote."
What are your top issues?
"So whenever we register someone to vote, Megan, we get their first name, last name, email address, phone number, home address."

"Elon Musk with all of his money fighting, quote, censorship in his public personality for the last year plus, teasing that he wouldn't endorse someone and then all of a sudden after the primary ends, he took such an opposition to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris that he felt the need to get involved."
"Do you know that, right?"
"Well, apologies."

And I have friends.
"We do not want to hand him the keys back to the White House where he can continue to try and divide us, offend people, and spew more hatred and bigotry in our society."

" Joe Biden has joined Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania for a campaign rally, one of the must-win states."

"Alyssa, we also have a brand new poll from the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, and it shows that Kamala Harris has a slight lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, 50 percent to 47 percent."
"But the New York Times, you scroll down here and their last poll in Pennsylvania was Biden plus six."
"If you say, well, I'm mad about higher prices, you say, well, what is exactly Donald Trump's plan for higher prices?"

Thank you very much And now we're gonna pivot over to CBS News campaign reporter Olivia Rinaldi.
It's because Mike Pence has come out as the rhino that he's always been and said that those of us that vote for Trump are toxic.
"But we do know what works on the ground, knocking on doors, talking to your neighbors and not bringing in folks, DC consultants and folks who don't understand the neighborhoods and the constituencies that need to be nudged to come out to vote."
"So you could argue, well, maybe just maybe a chunk of this registration surge is because of ancestral Democrats, and it probably is."
"That the voters in Chester County, Pennsylvania are ancestral Democrats?"
But a genocide outweighs all of this.
Both of them are fantastic I'm excited for Kamala.

"And so it was definitely something that voters responded to positively in a way, at least."
"A new poll in Pennsylvania, a new poll of 600 potential voters in Pennsylvania conducted by Susquehanna polling and research places Harris ahead by four percentage points in the state."
What a rally.
I like Trump as a person.
So check this out.
"Yeah, Republicans with new voters gained two thousand more new voters than Democrats did in the month of July."
"But again, my point is there is asymmetry in how objective and how much journalistic integrity these two places have."
"Now as for the remaining states, the two candidates do hold a clear edge in most of them as you'll soon come to see, but though they are all very likely to be decided by single digit margins, and so should either candidate come to win this race in landslide fashion, they could theoretically flip either direction."
"In today's final poll, also conducted by SoCal Strategies on the same date with 713 likely voters, Harris received 47% of the vote, while Trump received 48%."
I think trump is gonna win the election.
They're the only pollsters right now that have Harris winning Pennsylvania.
"And now, eight years after he was elected, after all the arguments against Obamacare have been proven to be wrong, and even folks who don't like me sure like that insurance, when he was asked about it, he said, well, I have a concept of a plan for how I'm going to do it."
"I'm going to vote for the guy who I want to succeed from this side, who has the least chance of being able to defeat the Democrat, whoever the Democrat is."
"And I wouldn't get caught off guard, right?"
I bet he's so unbearably smug right now deserves to be.

You can't let them do it because I didn't realize you were so dependent.
"If Michigan is sort of the 50-50 state, if that's the hinge on which the election is going to rotate, that's a terrible thing for the Democrats overall."
You know what the problem is?
"You have people who are here to hear about the future of America and Trump rants about his celebrity vengances, just so unpresidential."
So all these numbers were correct.
Buckle up.
"And in a lot of ways, it felt like the aspirations of working people have taken a back seat to the priorities of the rich and the powerful and the well-connected."
You win the election.
And it's an area that I think is up for grabs right now.
"From the bustling streets of Philadelphia to the serene farmlands in the north, Pennsylvania reflects the nation's varied political perspectives."
"Now, look, I'm seeing big enthusiastic pro democracy crowds in Pennsylvania made up, frankly, of Democrats, liberals, progressives, independents."
"Yeah, she's a good girl."
"But again, a lot of doom."
"But in my opinion, the biggest disaster for Harris comes from a voter block that I don't think is getting enough attention this cycle."
And now you've got people saying there's almost a 0% chance of knowing the winner.
"Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, a different approach."
So stupid.
Scranton's a place that climbs into your heart and it never leaves.
"But if she adds in, say, Arizona along with Georgia, that's a possibility."
Whoever is selected in the number two spot for the Democrats could indeed make an impact on the race for the White House.

"I mean, seems like the novelty you could say is worn off."
"Now, this is the same thing with Philadelphia and the suburbs."
Burn fat and feel more energized than they have in years.
We have respect that after being asked at the Atlantic Festival of people such as Pennsylvania voters.
"She goes on to say, I know the story of my neighborhood town, and I know the plight that a lot of these people escaped."
"It is clearly exposed and aligned and explained in the book, the great controversy."
"However, his pledge would also require the congressional approval."
It's got what?
"That is today swing state poll 2024 Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Harris ahead in two key battleground states."
So what's up with all these rich people giving their opinions about things.
And I know a lot of Republicans were a little worried because Donald Trump wasn't having a whole lot of fun in September.
"I'm walking around, I'm seeing former Congressman Jim Greenwood, moderate Republican from years ago in the House of Representatives, former Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois is here, former Congressman Denver Riggleman of Virginia."
Were you rally?
He's gonna put it back together.
"Anne Marie, it's funny that you say you confuse the pronunciations."
What else should we be looking at when we're trying to like figure out this election?
So keep that in mind as well.
"I'm aware of the American people want a solution that puts an end to the empty political rhetoric, which has failed to do anything for so long."
How much do you think that matters to undecided voters?
I don't run away by people but what can we do?
"Bing, bing, bong, bong, bing, bing, bing, bing."
"But once it's done, I would like to give this to President Trump as well, just to give him a show of gratitude."
"But this is, this is an original piece of art."
He's supported by me.
I'm not proud to say that either.
"Despite his tangents and impressions of foreign leaders, Trump assured his supporters of his intelligence and focus."
"And when we fight, we win."
Be patient with Pennsylvania.
This race is different.
Vice President Kamala Harris has an Indian mother and Jamaican father.
It's still poison.
How would turnout differ?
Oh we like Trump he represents our values and I Think he's gonna make America great again.
That was a political liability for Republicans and particularly for Donald Trump.
" Guys, welcome back to today's video."
" As the 2024 US presidential election approaches, several key battleground states are emerging as pivotal to the outcome."

"And when they come down to that choice, whether it's on basic rights like women's rights, women's rights and workers rights, there's there's no common ground between me and David McCormick."
And the mayor has talked about how it has been a strain on the community.
He was talking about her Time magazine cover.
"And obviously people will say, well, you know, there's going to be more mail-in ballots in 2020 because of the pandemic, but this is comparing both Republican and Democrat."
"And again, we're talking about people in the middle who don't know quite which way they're going."
"Which, let's be real, that's not a new tactic, but it feels different this time around."
It's a nonsensical candidacy.
One person even said it was like a weird church service.
"Of course, Donald Trump and I believe there were problems in 2020."
"She would destroy Trump in debate, highlight choice as an issue, energize our base and bring back young voters, give us a generational time change its time."
She's not cracking 50 in this poll.
"Thank you very much for joining us Oh, hey, it's just great to be here."
So he's not talking about the people at all.
And these what's crazy is how stable the internal demographics now are starting to look all the Hispanic voters.

My mother raised my sister and me she worked very hard again with this.

So the sun is rising on a heartbroken community.
The Wall Street Journal is another one.

"Well, I think the real question is, is how come the Democrats are spending so much time and money here?"
"Though most black men agreed to President Obama's sentiments, some made some rather strong objections."
If we look at those clips that I just showed you and say that person should be nowhere near the nuclear codes should be nowhere near a position of power that Donald Trump is someone who should be absolutely disqualified for being anywhere near any position of power because of his own behavior.
Voter registration doesn't matter either.
"Except for one poll, he's at 48, 49, and 50% of the vote."
"And Pennsylvania, they underestimated Trump by over five."

So now I get to vote for everybody that I want.
We don't know.
I got to put in a pitch for my friend Tom Hagan.

He's looking to retain his political position within his government.

"We're like, I like shiny objects."
"Yeah, Lindsay, we know that he was arrested on the perimeter of the rally."
"And I guess I don't think we'll know the answer until election night, really."

"And you're like, Oh, maybe he does hate Kamala."
 I'm Max Lopez.
"No improvement in Texas, no improvement in Florida, no improvement in Ohio, no improvement in many of these other states."
"But yeah, why are you here today?"

Now we talked to some Bay Area voters ahead of tonight's debate and one person told us Trump's rhetoric specifically around immigration is too divisive.
This is good news for Republicans.

Everybody tune in because it's time to address something.

All these different answers that may have been Biden voters from 2020 that are now coming back home with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket.
Because it is clear from internal Harris campaign data that this group is more up for grabs than it was in 2020 or even 2016.
"And they want to build 3,000 more independent pharmacies as well as make efforts to keep current ones open."
"Yeah, I mean, she didn't really answer the question."

"George, what are you learning?"

But Insider Advantage released this poll.
He won by a point.
"And even if he loses Georgia somehow, well, he wins Wisconsin more than likely."
Harris finished two points ahead of Trump in this poll.
And these are red rural areas where normally Republicans are vehemently opposed to mail-in voting.
Recently Fox released their national poll finding Donald Trump up 50 to 48 over Kamala Harris.
She knows that the youth vote can be a game changer in this election.
"Florida's Hispanic vote, a battle for influence."
"In addition, he stressed the closeness of the race as well as the critical role that voter turnout will have in the outcome of the election."
"He's been holding a town hall near Philadelphia, rallying his base in this crucial state."
So what the Obama appearance is about is about driving turnout among some of those core democratic coalitions.
"If we have to go with another four years of these people, these people, and she's worse, and she's worse than Biden, in my opinion."
"So so Republicans, whether they're for him or against them, have to acknowledge the fact that Donald Trump is still the leader of the Republican Party and that millions of Americans still follow him very, very closely."
"So when you look at this and you talk about the state, you see Harris in those teamster polls."
"Anyway, so check this out."
"In this analysis, we'll take a close look at recent polling data from these states and discuss what the numbers may signal for the upcoming election."

Was how to shoot somebody who out drew you.
According to that clip from Nancy Pelosi herself on the New Yorker.

"The warehouse, they say, was actually inside what they call the outer perimeter."
"Okay, we're going to go out on the deep end."
"During our visit, we discovered that Kamala Harris has garnered significant support from some of the wealthiest individuals in Pennsylvania, including several billionaires."
The electorate at large has become very polarized to the point where the number of states that are actually winnable for either candidate like they're both at play has dwindled.
"I generally just do not think that Mr. Trump could, uh, could lead the country at all."
You have one out of Emerson.
"Now, in contrast, Donald Trump is managed to get just about 310 odd million dollars."
" Alright man, so we got some absolutely huge news here for the Kamala Harris campaign."
And I watch his campaign rallies.
We had an instance where right now my stepsister is trapped in Lebanon and she has not been able to find a flight to come back to America where she lives with her husband and with her children.
They can mobilize tens of thousands of voters.
And I know we're talking about VP picks on a video about rust belt polls.
I heard today that it was an espionage case.
All the information's on there.
Is it going to be Maga Republicans?
So two eighteen cartons on top of each other.
"It's an example of how at the end of the day, this election, it's not just about policies."
"Yes, in the heat of that issue and homes being impacted, these people left everything behind and took a drive all the way to Reading, Pennsylvania to pass out the books."
All the major economists have said so.
Donald Trump made a strong closing statement by saying why didn't they do all the things that she's proposing during the three and a half years that they've been in office and Biden did this entire moderate stance back in 2020 and she's trying to do it again 2024 but she didn't talk about her policy changes between 2020 and 2024.
With states he has about as much chance of winning as he has of winning a BET award instead of the swing states.
"But already right now, he sits at 48% in this poll, which is absolutely huge."
"If if Donald Trump does not win the election, do you think he's going to admit that he lost?"
You'd be counting the ballots cast on election day and you'd simply push a button in each of the counties to get the other results from the mail in ballots.
"I'll put some graphics on it and re-release it so it's easier to consume because I know on these live streams, sometimes I just ramble a little bit."
"The Amish can't be pulled in many cases by families will share one phone and these, these are, these are businessmen."
This has to stop.
"The president will highlight that Donald Trump's plan would result in up to three and a half million dollars in cuts for some of the wealthiest Americans, which is 70 times what a typical family in Scranton makes in an entire year."
It's the candidate their policies for qualification gender race Ethnicity none of that matters in this race your your policies and your record is what matters to me One of the biggest policies that the Democrats are talking about this election cycle is so-called women's health and abortion access What do you make of Democrats making that the key to their campaign trying to appeal to women Democrats always seem to make abortion?
"Real quick, 20 seconds."
She did it on crowd size.
We used to be a country we used to have standards we used to have standards where candidates presidents will get shot and they get marked immediately bar.
 Let's pivot now to Libby Cathy.
"Now, there is a debate that we're also watching very closely."
All voters' worries about Donald Trump in that regard are baked in.
There's no way against Trump.
"Like, he's totally lost."
"I mean, they give us some data points, some early indicators."
"So I want to go north of Allegheny and I got, well, I got you here."
" And we see George Solis joins us now from Reading, Pennsylvania."
I'm going to go you all have a wonderful rest of the morning.
What do you say to that kind of voter?
"And here on our map, it gets marked down as Safe Democrat adding 10 more electoral votes to the Harris tally."
"Biden carried Allegheny County, about 60-40."
And that area of the country is also very much supportive of abortion rights.
I don't know if you can hear this.
"Trump this weekend stepping up his anti-immigrant rhetoric and suggesting he might use the military against, quote, radical left lunatics on Election Day."
"That's a pattern that we see with these tokens in the Democratic party, the ones they promote."
"If the same polling misoccurs that occurred back in 2020, Trump's got it."
"After 2040, some are even going up to 2035."
Why is it worth it to be here?
It has the most of any swing state.
What is that all about?
"In his 10th trip to the region since the war began in October, the top US diplomat will meet with senior Israeli leaders including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu."
"And Kamala Harris decided to put somebody who may claim to be from the Rust Belt, even though Minnesota is not really the Rust Belt, but has a track record of a nut job."
"I mean, since we've seen the debate, which was actually just less than two months ago, a month and a half ago, even prior to that, we saw that Joe Biden was starting to drop in the polls, starting to drop in support, the uncommitted vote started to get higher, the amount of democratic sentiment that was pushing away from the party was getting higher."
Took about four or five seconds for a lot of us to recognize that first of all firecrackers shouldn't be lit or ignited at an event like this so there was something suspicious about it even though it sounded like firecrackers there was a pretty quick realization this could be something much more dangerous and let me be unequivocal about something.
Isn't it a little beneath you to buy a sexy outfit to make me jealous?
"Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, that was the three states that put Trump over the edge in 2016."
"As we inch closer to election day, the tension is palpable."
All three states had been Democratic strongholds before Trump turned them red on his path to winning the presidency in 2016.
Another issue that is high stakes this election is the abortion issue.
They were showing hundreds of lines of different hacking from other countries that night.
"I think that's what you're getting at, Congressman."
"The speaker reflected on the contrasting narratives presented by the media, claiming his speeches are inaccurately labeled as ramblings, despite their coherence."
No matter how many lawsuits or court cases there were.
All these neo-cons who were the worst people in the world.
They were not remotely accurate until the final week of the election.
I'm very proud to be able to come here and speak today.
"Okay, the child is birth from Virgo twice in January of 2019 and September of 2023."
So how is the Trump campaign responding to all this?
"You know, maybe you get one or two of those people here and there, but that's not the lion's share of the people registering as Republicans or even independents for the record."
They were off by seven points back then.
You look at what's happening in states like Kentucky with these extreme abortion bans because of Donald Trump.
"And even the cars, if you look, they want to go with all electric cars."
Let's end on that.
It's a closed primary too.
It's Friday.
"Pennsylvania, a state in flux."
They don't want to do it.
"Yeah, good morning, Vlad."
"At different points in time, even leading up to the announcement that Joe Biden was leaving the race, 17 percent was the delta between unfavorable and favorable across the nation."
That's going to be a key question.
"He says he's going to take another question, then changes his mind and then calls Democrats evil."
"Beanies, scullies."
"I honestly say it a few different ways, too, Connell."
It's a consistent thing that we are now seeing.
"But to see his foreign policy in action, to see his domestic policy, it's undeniable."
I cannot stress to you how close this election is y'all.
And I think there is reason to expect that he can continue to grow in the polls because he has that three point gap between his vote share and Trump's vote share.
"That is really good news for Kamala Harris and also just goes to show that these are pollsters that come from very different backgrounds, very different funding sources, very different methodologies in understanding the Pennsylvania electorate."
"Pennsylvania, we do not need four more years of that."
"We've got a strat chat, as we like to call it, with a Republican and a Democrat to kind of talk about these issues."

"But helping to reinvigorate skateboarding, getting young people interested, getting people to get their kids interested in being physically fit, physically active, creative."
But we have another song coming out in hopefully a month that is a tongue in cheek song about these political elites who believe they're the smartest and the best and they're better than you.
We see a shooter that must have been people further back into the crowd.
He had a pretty good upbringing and had a pretty secure life growing up just like I did.
You don't even have to use my pronouns.
The exception though being Franklin and Marshall which overestimated the Dems by 12 points in 2016 and 5 in 2020.
There's only two days left to register to vote in Georgia and Arizona 48 hours.
"He then says the reason that he loses is because Democrats cheat, play the clip."
They're going to go head to head in their one and only debate.
I'm saying about these big oil companies and these fossil fuel companies.
 Total running time for each presidential candidate after tonight's heated Harris Trump debate wrapped up a little while ago from President Trump Speaking just under 43 minutes Vice President Harris speaking just over 37 and a half minutes Plus we just got the first results from our incident poll a debate watchers stand by for that.
"That's from that's from our FK Junior, whose father was also unfortunately assassinated after his uncle, John F. Kennedy Jr. Let's see what others are saying."
But he's also been a liberal Republican for his entire career.
"So, you know, Trump probably wins the state by double digits."
And the fact is the consistency is what I find to be the most interesting about it all is that 50 to 46 in these three battleground states and keep in mind this is an A plus rated pollster.
There's a Trump right there.
I don't really I don't know the ins and outs.
"This one may turn into a little bit of a rant, but I feel like it won't answer or at least address most of the questions that have come in."
She's still trying to make me a little bit better.
There's nothing really named after Kamala Harris in that part of Pennsylvania.
"And this, again, is an endorsement of Newsmax even."
He's at 50 percent and Kamala Harris is down there at 47 percent.
"When Joe Biden dropped out of the race, he was losing nationally by roughly three points."
"Oh, wait, because she has to win votes."
"No matter how much I might like some of the things he does, I would not vote for him."
That's why we hold elections.
"With respect to the other economic policies, I think folks in Pennsylvania are really just beginning to get to know what some of those policies are."
How do people get that understanding of who she is?
"I'm the only governor in the entire country with a divided legislature, one house led by Democrats, one led by Republicans."
"Thomas Reid â€“ $3 million Thomas Reid, a prominent figure in Pennsylvania's energy sector, has donated $3 million to Kamala Harris' campaign."
"Thank you, Rachel."
"Kamala Harris now leading by four points in these three states shows a shift not only from what we saw with Biden, but potentially from the 2020 presidential election where Donald Trump lost these states, but not by four points in any of them."
But I think that y I look at gas prices beca on that.
"She's going to have to do all the press conference, which she has refused to do."
"If he ends up losing, I think he even said that he would win California if Jesus was the vote counter."
Those are the ones I'm expecting.
The article does mention that they recently brought in Paulette Aniskoff.
"Well, he will also have his friend and supporter Elon Musk right there with him."
"And the thing about that is, you know, these voters are going to get older."
Concept.
That would be young voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.
There were reports that people were looking for shade hiding by diesel generators connected to some of the food vendors.
"Then when Trump says I'm more attractive, the crowd cheered not because of a conventional definition of beauty, but rather because he's white, they're deeply racist."
Are you ready to go?
We gotta protect our borders.
"If these were in fact gunshots, are there concerned about everybody's safety as people are now moving in aimless directions, bumping into each other, bumping into tossed equipment?"
"And they've urged Harris in private meetings to do more to turn out voters of color, which is strange because Kamala is a person of color."
But it's clear that these are not just voters from Westmoreland.
So there's Harris on the one hand.
We did a video on this.
"After addressing the crowds in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump rallied in the battleground state of Wisconsin, where the Republicans said that the state needed liberation from the Democrats."
"And then this part, which somewhat relates to it, right?"
"I was a childless dog lady because I didn't, I didn't meet the right person to tell us over 40 years old."
And that's because she really believes in sparking growth among small businesses in this country.
"Yeah, apparently there is a lot of internal fighting in Pennsylvania."
"The less Biden there is, the better off she's going to be."
"So so if you had to say one thing to people who were undecided to if there was people who were undecided and didn't know who to vote for this election, what would you tell them?"
"She is serving as vice president right now, but what do you want to know about her personal vision for the Oval Office, maybe even separate from President Biden's?"
"Oh, look, that person is now cooperating."
Sent people to jail.
These are slim margins in the battleground states.
"For that matter, do you think Donald Trump has ever changed the tire in his life?"
People love their donuts and they're fervent about their particular donut.
"And while in Pittsburgh, President Biden, he made a speech at the United Steelworkers headquarters, this on the heels of the announced acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan-based Nippon Steel."
But let's not get too ahead of ourselves.
"We still remember our brothers who fought in World War II, World Buffalo, Civil War."
Why?
Not nice ones like to her either.
We got Trump trash cans.
"Okay, great."
Her contribution is a testament to her belief that Harris will lead the charge in combating climate change and advancing renewable energy initiatives.
"I mean, Obama won it."
It's definitely not over.
"In other words, Biden got it back in 2020 after it went for Trump."
You mentioned he's won everyone pretty widely.
So it was a long time coming that he would be extending his support fully to the Republican candidate.
With politics aside fracking has been positive I would say all around.
Believe it there.
He went as far as saying that he wished the driver had been a white man.
Take it with you.
We can see it in these battleground states and performance.
"This is so bad that if Donald Trump would have taken Democrats' advice, and I'm sure most of us realize that he's using the whole COVID thing as a way to say Donald Trump's a terrible president because when he left office, of course COVID was raging and you had all his, his economy got destroyed because of it."
"Maybe, but also is he running through the tape here?"
But this is not a conventional election.
"It was packed and now when we just saw you recently, you know, you can see that that area has been cleared."
"Wisconsin, it's less than one point between the two."
And I'm really optimistic.
"It's hack, Liso."
We're putting this book out before the election.
Am I saying he's going to win the state by three?
"Yes, I have decided."
So terrible.
"And what has happened since the 2020 election when Donald Trump narrowly lost against Joe Biden, lost the state of Pennsylvania, okay?"
"If you're gonna place a bet, don't come to me just yet."
"Well, he's first of all, Bob Casey is a great American supporting Kamala Harris."
I could be in a gorgeous beach somewhere in the world.
"This is part of a swing that Donald Trump did last week, including speaking to law enforcement members and doing a town hall with Sean Hannity in Pennsylvania, a state that the Trump campaign has repeatedly made an emphasis and focus as they head towards November."
"Because Jesse Jackson, for all his flaws, was pro-FBA."
"I want to ask you about this far-right activist, this woman, Laura Loomer, who's been traveling with Donald Trump."
Can you just give me a quick synopsis about it and why is it important to drop that book?
"And everybody's going to hear us, and hear us loud today."
"Well, you're my name is Derek."
We saw it in the focus groups afterwards.
Casey himself is at 48% as well.
They don't know where she stands on anything.
"Oh this guy's good 1,024th that means essentially that I have more Indian blood in me than she has and I have done Unfortunately, I'd like to have some also Alina Haba gave a speech in front of that fairly empty crowd as well, but Who's gonna tell her here play this clip?"
"And a lot of them did vote for him twice, but also you talk about him just gaining potential support in a lot of these places."
He survived two assassination attempts.
So now they're running him again.
"Like, what?"
But watching this early vote will give us an insight into what's going to be happening.
Vance.
The economy is doing pretty well.
He's a teacher.
"I see from people Indiana's primary Donald Trump got 78% of the vote against Nikki Haley in Indiana that prompted a lot of people to claim that oh, well Trump is having a lot of Republicans defect from him."
We can spend a little more time.
"And if he's running, I will, he's got my vote."
And you could talk about the suburbs of Philadelphia.
Reading sits in Pennsylvania's so-called Latino belt.
I also believe that any small business needs to think out of the box.
I brought it here to live paint.
You're a primer on the race to the White House.
He's very selfless.
"And tonight, another record high in the stock market, the Dow closing above 43,000 for the first time ever today."
Thanks for watching.
"First of all, talk about a man that just escaped the, the, the, uh, the assisted living at home."
"Even 2016 same thing occurred September 2nd, 2016 or September 3rd."
And here he is randomly talking about Hannibal Lecter again.
"They'll be counted regardless of this, you know, irrelevant sort of, you know, useless just error that they're trying to use to try to throw them out."
What do you think about this?
And so I think the grace that has to be awarded to this community and this point of time is that this issue is as has to be as prioritized as those that I spoke to domestically.
We are all part of the divine nine.
We're supposed to believe the same schools that make you sign a permission slip for your kids to go to the planetarium are taking them for sex change operations.
While Trump was on stage at a rally in Pennsylvania a sniper from some distance attempted to assassinate him.
But it does strike me as the right to vote is one of the most cherished institutions that we have in this country.
"I think in the end, it's a non-event because what matters is an impact on the voters and what they hear about it."
All eyes on Philly today.
"Of course, you heard me said before, your cars will be down and we're getting rid of all the electric."
How will you answer that?
"And if you look at, let's just look at Michigan, for example."
His refusal to play along with Trump's scheme sent the former president into a tailspin.
"Then Tuesday, Governor Tim Walz had multiple radio interviews scheduled in rural areas in battleground states that he joined remotely."
U I'm still tired.
"In a desperate bid to secure more electoral votes for his potential 2024 run, Trump pushed for a change in the way Nebraska allocates its votes."
What's happening after the striking down of Roe versus Wade is that both parties realize that that their extremes are where the country is.
But this feels like a strange political maneuver to go after black men to say we're going to protect your marijuana and your crypto currencies.
He is currently winning Pennsylvania by a couple points.
I want to see taxes go down I want to see the economy better housing.
You confessed.
"Christine Gotta, who supported Nikki Haley during the primary, still undecided."
And so there's there's a side of the Republican Party conservatives that are just dying for a straight question and answer.
America has an electoral college system in which each state is given a number of votes roughly in line of the size of its population.
Governor Shapiro loves his job.
Political has reported that the Harris campaign has been chaotic and fallen short in this must win state and in the must win city of brotherly love Philadelphia.
"Now, Josh Shapiro is and he's pro-Israel."
That's despite there being three.
"They look at those long term party trends, which tend to be more stable."
And what do you make of these arguments of Trump's racist?
"But Republicans didn't take the lead in really any of those swing states that they ended up falling short until like mid October, late October."
"Well, that's awesome."
 We're watching.
"Pennsylvania is really shaping up as the one to watch, isn't it?"
"He criticized her record on immigration crime and gun control, accusing her of failing the American people."
"And so Pennsylvania at specific here, I think with its 19 electoral votes also comes in at a unique point."
Was it a good relationship?
We don't need him here again for a while.
The global stage is a disaster.
There you go Listen before I let you go.
"Oh, wow."
He can get it done.
"By the way, even the Amish individuals who were in attendance got bored."
And the moderate Republicans are going to be the deciders.
"Amazing group of people like you see, they had a lot of books, man."
She will drive them out She will drive out the white women in ohio.
She should be up by four to five points.
I'm out of here.
Emerson.
"You know, Donald Trump was just endorsed by President Duda of Poland."
"It may not have the best explanation, but it's offering things in very sharp contrasting language."
"Yeah, I don't know."
We got the papers and we're waiting to pay our permits so we want to do the right thing but the cops basically told us they weren't going to press the issue with us but if the code board or I guess whoever would.
"This is just fantastic, no other way around that."
But I do think that you really have to look at these moderate Republican voters.
They think they can have the most success.
It's like you could give me a million bucks to run a marathon.
"And even in a race like this where Republicans underperformed by, you know, around 20 points, still 50-50 counties."
"Just remember, endorsing incumbents and Republican nominees in red districts is not a difficult way to run up your score for endorsements when you have actual tough races where the primary winner might actually affect who wins."
"The numbers are in, and we now know 67 million people tuned in for the presidential debate, between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump."
They're about having sex.
"Over the last 20,000 Pennsylvanians make their living out of the natural gas industry."
"Now, even more proud she left the GOP."
Dick Pullman.net You wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer like I said for 22 years covering the presidential elections in 1992 96 2000 2004 and 2008 How do you view Pennsylvania as a swing state in this year's presidential election?
"Biden has been spending a lot of time in the state, a lot of money in the state, but still according to two recent polls, he's not really in a very good position right now."
"We saw the Secret Service rush the podium when the noises began, move President Trump, former President Trump off the stage, and when he emerged he appeared to have some blood somewhere near one of his ears."
It's really difficult to see a path to victory for him if he were to lose it as he did in 2016.
What's important to voters there and is it comparative at all to Wisconsin?
"Yes, please!"
And what is that?
"Again, all of these efforts aimed at trying to make sure that there is no doubt sowed in the election outcome here in Georgia, particularly in light of what happened here in 2020."
"Of course not Pennsylvania can absolutely go to Harris, but these numbers are so bad for Democrats that it makes you really wonder how likely is it that Harris could actually win Pennsylvania because it's not just one metric."
"Before President Trump is refusing to commit to accepting the results if he loses, if he does refuse, what happens here in Pennsylvania?"
F-A-N-I Fani.
"Now, they may ultimately start claiming fraud and some of them are anecdotally or whatever the case may be."
"Yeah, Pennsylvania polling is trash, especially in October."
They didn't have anything.
We're going to run through this pretty quick.
I just love teachers.
We are tired of going to the grocery store and spending $500 instead of $200.
I want that to continue.
"But what is the Harris, Biden-Harris administration done?"
So Georgia has 16.
Completely.
"And I don't want to settle for the lesser of two evils in this case, especially in a primary."
And he dropped out because there were family problems.
Can you imagine if I did that?
"And ultimately, you're sort of relying on, OK, she may be doing the old TikTok here and there maybe for Gen Z or whatever."
The sun would be beaming down.
"So, of course, Trump and Musk, the team will go get back and they will be together to support this campaign and to extend the cause."
"I'm curious, were you surprised at what we found?"
They need to know that everything is going to be okay.
Donald Trump has taken the lead out of the state of Pennsylvania in the real clear politics polling average.
We need to make sure that no one's ever forgetting that.
"He fist-bumped, as you said."
"What we're seeing in a lot of these primaries is a test of how far the simple backing of Donald Trump will carry you, whatever your past record happens to be."
The voting block of the Amish have gone up over a thousand percent from 16 to 2020.
We've had enough of them.
"Hey, did you ever see the unselect committee?"
"It was just a bunch of lies and dodging and trying to make yourself look as such like a wonderful princess It's crap man And I tell you voters are not going to the voting booth with all But what you guys are what they're what they're pushing People are struggling millions are have done are dying to stop people have died And I tell you a lot of people are voting with their pocketbooks, I'm sorry That's just the truth behind it I am feeling very good about Pennsylvania because there are a lot of People in Pennsylvania who deserve to be seen and heard that's why I'm here in Johnstown and I will be continuing to travel around the state People are really vote please tell me some y'all people are voting for this People are clapping for this Oh She barely got this thought out oh my goodness Check out the word process and check out the body language."
"And Mary Alice, we know immigration is an important issue for a lot of voters out there, but we've seen Trump doubling down on those unsubstantiated claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield."
But I can't change that because they believe it because they've heard it so many times.
The 11th poll was conducted by Morning Consult between September 19 and 25 with 993 registered voters.
"And he has a track record of doing that, which he did in the gubernatorial race."
"But there's a lot of doom and gloom from a lot of people, even on the right, about this election."
So Pennsylvania is a huge one.
And then Quinnipiac so far has been the biggest margin for either candidate at Harris plus five.
Is that headline on social media even telling the whole story or is it just trying to get clicks?
Look at that Trump.
So on the national picture when it comes to polls we're not seeing as much volume that we saw at this point in say 2016.
"This is a lie, man It needs to change."
"And listen, I'm so excited to be here."
"Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one."
It's going to be huge in Arizona where abortion is on the ballot.
It's in Florida.
"All it did was make them more dangerous and less accessible, especially the people who need it."
You do not either.
We need a t

"Personally, it was likely gonna come down to two people, Dr. Oz and David McCormick."
"So again, numbers guy, data guy, let's break this down by the math."
"I didn't like that she didn't answer direct questions about her policies and direct questions about what happened in the last 3 1,000 years that she should have been part of."
Trump inching slightly ahead.
They now found Trump tied in Pennsylvania.
Doesn't have a picture of her.
Give this a watch.
So you can see that is actually becoming significantly shorter and smaller of a gap.
"That will help, because raising kids is hard."
"In his signature style, he took a dig at his political rivals and said that he will save democracy once he's voted back to power."
I didn't know she was black until a few years ago when she became black and now wants to be known as black.
He believes he can turn anything into gold.
We don't want to speak so are we happy?
It's so negative.
"I'm so proud, uh, that they have my back and I have theirs in my office in Harrisburg and our state capital."
"Now, he has this crazy, crazy, crazy notion that putting a tariff of 60% on every single product imported from China is a good idea."
There are three reasons why both candidates are focusing on Pennsylvania.
In a way they weren't.
And then there's easily observable reality.
"Now, I'm not saying that's all because of new voters."
"Despite this, Harris has reasons to celebrate, as new polls show her leading Donald Trump in several swing states, suggesting a potential new electoral path through the Sun Belt states."
"To me, he's anti-establishment."
"We also heard in Laura's report, Donald Trump rail against FBI crime statistics."
They want to take away your right to bear arms.
"Even Trump Republicans, as Laura mentioned, are responding quickly."
It was Donald Trump who ripped away the rights of freedom of women in America.
Good morning to you.
"It's a little bit strange to even wrap our heads around, Kate."
"Chris, you don't, you don't use a lot of gas in your bike, but you do buy everything else and everything else is going up."
So we got to get our base out.
"But that's not what you said, Danielle."
They tried to fortify the elections.
"Maybe that caused the weird swinging Pennsylvania, but that doesn't apply to Georgia, Arizona, Nevada."
And so the last election Biden won it very narrowly.
I believe Arizona might be the only state that's outside of margin of error.
They had Hillary Clinton winning it by six points.
"Tonight, Science Harris is closing the gap on the economy."
"And he was like, I'm so sorry, ma'am."
"We want, you know, our children to thrive."
Good morning.
And that is signaling the strength of the DeSantis wing of the party.
"But as a young person, I don't like the way that things are going, and I just honestly quite concerned."
This targeted advertising aims to enhance Harris' personal narrative and economic policies.
Both candidates are campaigning in Pennsylvania this week.
I put a truth.
"While Kamala Harris enjoys a steady support on several fronts, when it comes to key issues like immigration and economy, several polls have shown that the voters are leaning towards Donald Trump as the preferred president to deal with these issues."
And these visits come as Vice President Kamala Harris visited Erie PA last night while former President Donald Trump spoke to a crowd of local supporters in Oaks.
"The first question, when you move in a neighborhood, where do you work?"
"Vice President Kamala Harris will join President Biden in Pittsburgh, their first joint campaign event since he stepped aside, and she became the nominee."
"And so I think that's what you're hearing from folks who are going towards a third party candidate, be it Stein or someone else."
Did you ever feel like you had to stop the count?
"So John Wick, not very good at polling."
The Deep State is going to do everything they can to take this man out.
He said she's an African-American woman who won office last year on a tough on crime message and when help Harris went over disillusioned black voters and working class white men.
It's authentic and it's real.
"Just 50% of American adults lived in middle class middle income households down from 54% in 2001, 59% in 1981, and 61% in 1971."
"Be it Vice President Harris or former President Trump, I want to understand electoral politics that we have at play."
If you want to vote for Biden and think that's going to be effective then go ahead.
"Right, you know what they say, any press is good press."
They're very like xenophobic Islamophobic You know homophobic etc.
We're going to make our country get this is going to be I want this to be a really important evening.
" Okay, I know how much you love data and looking at things so I'm going to show you a map and that is the county and congressional map of the state of Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania is a swing state in this coming election and I want to show you what's going to happen on election night and that is all of the news stations that people will be watching, even on the internet, they will be getting reports of what the vote counts are for every single county across the country and as we're looking at the election returns coming in throughout the night on election night you start doing the math to anticipate what the outcome is going to be and the math involves what we know about how voters have voted in all the different counties in every single state."
And so I just want to start off by getting your reaction to this pick.
He cannot lose it.
And thanks for watching.
"Yeah, I mean, I would agree."
Michigan trumps up about 1.2 percentage points.
"So like, d last time or how did so money of his own."
"I look at his economic policy, and he's basically talking about a huge national sales tax without any kind of approval from Congress."
I think there's plenty of things we could work together on.
"With such high stakes, every move they make is crucial."
She has this.
I'm gonna take care of you.
It's not that they were in deficit mode.
"It's not the popular vote, it's the electoral college."
That's what you see.
"So 10 percent, that's almost two points that would go away from Harris."
"Well, I mean, she didn't want to."
We appreciate your time.
There's polling out of both of these counties.
They are looking for a vision in Kamala Harris message with the governor.
Let's talk about Dave McCormick.
"Kristen, what was his rally like?"
You have this beautiful brain.
"But I think it's important to note that we shouldn't really, in my opinion, count any polls before the debate because that was a huge event and some of the polling numbers have really changed."
But here's the good news cutting this one thing out of your diet could completely transform the way you feel and our friends at V Shred have seen it firsthand with their clients helping them build muscle.
Why aren't we looking at it?
"Some attendees worried about the rising cost of living, while others expressed anxieties about border security and the state of America's standing in the world."
Back in 2020 Democrats made up roughly 63% of absentee requests.
"And you I'm telling you right now, you better wake up."
"Therefore, when Democratic candidate Kamala Harris promotes her economic agenda, she heads to Pittsburgh, the industrial heart of Pennsylvania."
I'm not doing you know lean or likely States in this.
And it kind of feels like the Republicans wait to maybe steal some of the thunder away from the Democrats on their big day as we await their decision on who will be the vice presidential nominee for the Democrats.
"A strong criticism targeted Kamala Harris, suggesting she is unfit for her role and highlighting past controversies, reinforcing the argument against her political credibility."
"We're using their terms, right?"
Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney?
"Security is increased, but do you also anticipate that there's going to be any changes for the location of the stage?"
"These are real results, not polls, they say."
I'm standing in a parking lot in Baltimore where just last week the so-called Blacks for Trump bus appeared hoping to change hearts and minds in a very blue state.
"He could win by 21 but still like to say that this proves that Donald Trump is Jover, you know by that logic."
"I know we always say it, but it's usually very true, which is why it's important that we make sure that we get our news from sources that cut through the bias so we know what's really going on."
I think the latter for very specific reason.
"She'll give first-time homebuyers up to $25,000 to help them with a down payment."
So maybe I think four.
Everybody on earth that covers politics or talks about politics on YouTube was live right after that debate.
Inflation is an issue.
"As the first female vice president, the first black vice president, and the first Asian-American vice president, she embodies the changing face of American leadership."
"I feel like for most of the stuff that I hear or see on as far as her ads that she's putting out, it's mostly more similar, not identical, but more similar to when Obama was running where he did not slander his opponent."
"He did not shake our unyielding resolve to save America from evils of poverty, hatred and destruction."
We have to talk about the 2024 presidential election because Donald Trump is surging in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.
Is the danger any different when a king would rush straight into a bunch of men with spears?
"Trump, Trump, man."
They're not going to vote on Election Day.
"Former President Bill Clinton is supporting Harris in Georgia, while Senator Bob Casey is targeting GOP challenger Dave McCormick's residency in a new advertisement."
And so you see how people evaluate those social issues plays out in how the vote breaks really dramatically.
"So massive, massive, massive gains that the Trump team has still yet to combat and still yet to see any type of boost in their own battleground states."
Yeah that's absolutely true.
He is safe.
You are the first African-American lieutenant governor in the Commonwealth and also the youngest.
She couldn't move something.
It ticks through a number of those Sunbelt states.
"And I'll tell you what I told him, I thought what he did was really honorable that he put country first, that he stood as a patriot."
I just don't see why...
"And we're talking about I drove from Reading to North Carolina before it was 10 hours, at least 10 hours."
"Now, if there is one part of this that is a little bit worrying for the Democrats, it's the city of Philadelphia itself."
"Early this morning, KDK's Barry Pintar loaded up into a car and met up with Dan Snyder of CBS News Philadelphia in the heart of Pennsylvania."
I don't think you got 55 percent of Catholics in Pennsylvania.
"So if Trump is up in Pennsylvania, well, go back to the map here."
Or we're going to give $20 billion to Israel to fight a war.
Have you heard this stuff and what do you make of that attack by Democrats?
Virginia Tech?
They see Donald Trump brag about Vladimir Putin.
Is there anything else you wanted to mention?
I really don't care.
"But basically once a week, Pennsylvania is it."
He couldn't answer that question.
I know that like black men and some black women who see the play.
"As the 2024 election cycle heats up, the rally's impact on the race for the White House remains to be seen."
"And if you like that, then good for you."
"Let's say by some miracle, Quinnipiac and Bloomberg, they're right in the average."
She does seem to be an outside figure.
"They most of them, the majority of them, Hannah, have said there are things they like about Shapiro."
That is Donald Trump.
"How is it possible when everyone else, even Franklin and Marshall found Harris plus three?"
There would be quite the symbolic nature of them winning versus Trump.
We understand that ultimately you have a binary choice come this November.
He's performed through all of this.
"But if you look at battleground states, where electoral votes are decided, it looks like Harris has a lead in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and even in Michigan."
"Thanks so much for talking to us We're gonna talk to one of your customers now, you know, as we said This is a place where people come in and have breakfast and lunch regularly We've talked to people who come here with their church groups with their families and we're gonna speak to a mom now Mary Jane who Comes here regularly as well."
"This razor-thin margin demonstrates that Pennsylvania is highly competitive, and Trump remains a formidable challenger capable of gaining ground."
"Clinton plus nine, Clinton plus 10, plus eight, plus seven."
But the other guy's just melted ice cream.
"Yeah, I'm only 18, so this will be... Well, I registered last October, but... First election?"
That's a four-point swing.
We've seen lower numbers than that.
Some of it has not.
"Wow, AWOL, away without leave."
They were critical of the Obama administration.
What are you doing?
The country's unsafe.
"So I guess everybody's in the state, both of you guys."
"But before you praise State Senator Bartolotta too much, keep in mind that she is not only a Republican, even after the things he said about Charleroi and its good, hardworking people who are doing their best to take care of their families, she's also still a Trump supporter."
President Biden has tariffs in place.
I Like his policy with the border and that's my favorite I think we should need to deport all of the illegal immigrants and I think that we need to take our country back Absolutely.
This is not a thing.
"Indeed, Republicans had a real opportunity to select that strong challenger, specifically the relatively moderate hedge fund manager and former Treasury Department official David McCormick, who finished second in the Republican primary by just 951 votes."
That's your easiest pathway to winning.
Republicans are going to spend 80 million dollars over the next three months.
But this is a moment that is going to change the trajectory of this campaign.
She's given hardly any interviews thus far.
"Jake, thanks very much."
"Yeah, they're very respectful."
That's coming from public polls.
I know people in the fracking industry aren't falling for.
"If you do, make sure to like this video and subscribe to Global News Network for more content like this."
She went away.
"Again, 2020 was decided by 80,000 votes."
"But even without Georgia, well, Trump's pathway to winning is fairly simple."
Anything that's a hindrance right now is because of an executive branch that has failed to perform.
I saw it in Philadelphia when she and Governor Walz fired up that crowd in Philly.
Compressors been working so hard.
The remaining four pollsters though range from a plus one to Trump to a plus two for Harris.
They have those industrial steel towns.
And I've seen some nice nice handbags that Alina Haber is walking around with.
They're saying we've got record job growth.
That's the kind of person we need to send back to Washington.
And some media says you have... That would be called discipline.
The fifth trumpet unleashes a plague of demonic locusts that torment those who have not been sealed by God.
How progressive are you on making it a priority and righting America's wrongs?
"And she said, the polling is so bad in Pennsylvania, that not even Josh Shapiro could deliver the state."
"But I'm just curious, as you've been covering this election, as we know, it's unprecedented what we're dealing with right now."
There's a man.
" Hi, thank you for joining us."
I have not banned fracking as vice president United States.
There's nothing and all of us are kind of reeling from it.
"He said just just the other day, we actually lost it by a whisker."
And that's what's been happening.
"Absolutely massive, right?"
I laughed.
She will not ban fracking.
"He just wants to, he wants to do it."
"Since opening in 2017, our goal has been to provide our customers with consistently high quality products, while also supporting other small businesses and our community."
It's up to the artist to paint that visual reality.
"You know, the Biden campaign has been very clear that they want these Haley supporters."
And why did you put the tape over Mike Pence's name there?
"She was anti fracking in twenty nineteen and we all know that's still her stance, no matter what she says now."
We did.
"And finally, honestly, it's the first time I've ever seen a candidate running for, certainly for like national office, you know, like a Democrat running for national office, but even, you know, in the general election."
"That's right, Tam, just weeks away from the election."
I don't know why he's imagining Kamala Harris as his wife in some weirdo bizarro thing that he shouldn't be talking about at all.
Something like four and a half out of the seven days that week she's returning.
"But the other day, anytime I hit too hard, they say he was rambling, rambling."
"Other than that, shit boy, Jay."
Do you remember how you felt at the time?
You'll want to see that.
That's going to be her response.
There's a lot there that she can answer to.
"I am the governor of the great state of South Dakota, but I'm going to tell you one thing."
And we make more money.
"They're the kind of Republicans Harris hopes will cross party lines, in some cases, for the very first time."
"I'm focused every day on one thing and one thing only, and that is being the best governor I can be for the good people of Pennsylvania."
Her donation reflects her support for Harris' efforts to expand healthcare access and improve the quality of care for all Americans.
"I think we've got momentum and look, I'm a sports guy."
"Both Harris and Trump are preparing for a long night, with their teams ready to respond to the unfolding drama."
Now let's zoom out a bit.
I know about golf.
She's absent from the campaign trail.
"The biggest, we don't know if that's an urban only phenomenon, if it also translates to poor, more rural areas in the state."
"Okay, we'll start with the economy."
I guess.
"Now, am I saying it's for sure going to be a polling miss?"
"Thank you, Pittsburgh."
That's bad.
"No, that's fine That's good."
I've seen you been faced a lot of opposition.
"Meantime, the next event listed on Donald Trump's website is Friday in Montana."
"Pennsylvania is always a swing state, but it feels like the whole election could hinge on it this time around."
We just energized.
"All private sector, big law, Yale Law School, all of these different things that J.D."
"With favorable polling data in key battleground states and a strong legal foundation, Trump's campaign is positioned to make a significant impact on the outcome of the election."
I do not believe this shooting was political at all.
"By highlighting this legal win, Trump can galvanize his base, encouraging them to turn out in greater numbers."
"On the South side, you have the mainline, old school, traditional."
It is neck and neck in Wisconsin.
I am not sure why it isn't.
"So it's... To me, you know, I've lived my life."
And that is substantial.
"Well, the problem with Donald Trump is that when he doesn't have a vision to offer, he starts to go and he starts to personalize attacks."
There was a lot of craziness and silliness that we saw here.
"And if you want gas, great."
"Okay, this is this is what I know."
He said January 6th was a day of love.
"So this is why the vice president Kamala Harris just says, let Trump's talk, speaking, do the arguments for them."
"I mean, if you have a job in Pennsylvania in the fracking industry, what kind of money are you making annually?"
The debates will be fascinating to watch.
"We need these, we need to come out and wreck our numbers."
"So also illegal Latinks men also are gonna get that too, as far as I'm concerned, because she can't discriminate based on race and skin color as much as she'd like to."
"Moving to the fourth poll from August 6th to 8th, conducted by Trafalgar Group, with 1,078 likely voters, Harris received 44% of the vote, while Trump received 46%."
So that's where Trump has got to really act before he also has to do better in the cities.
Again you can really see that both campaigns really making a push for the Latino vote across Pennsylvania.
"I'm not saying that Trump's going to win Pennsylvania by four points or whatever, but you cannot tell me that this is a fluke that nearly every poll."
This election cycle has been all about Donald Trump maintaining and building momentum.
But let's talk.
Insurance.
Because they're not just letting this go.
"This election, Terry, in many ways is going to be fought on a number of different fronts."
Or Deflate Gatsby.
It's too strong.
We've got less than eight months to go.
No school has ever changed a boy into a girl.
What was the atmosphere like at the airport today?
I have a theory and you have to bear with me on this.
"Now the Harris campaign provided a list of politico of several examples of surrogate events aimed at engaging voters of color, actress America and Ferrera and others are all going to be there."
"Listen, I don't really, I'm not on the side of Joe Biden, not on the side of Trump either, right?"
" What is up YouTube is coffee back with another update and yes, it's another update about Trump What a crazy scene we got saw go down today in Pennsylvania And I was saying in another video not just what happened today how it felt so surreal and just like what the fuck You know everything from how it went down to his reaction just everything And then you take that along with other stuff that we've been seeing in the news as a latest just like man What in the world is going on in these crazy times?"
And those are comments that Harris wants people to be focused on what she thinks about what a Trump presidency take two would be.
I?
Absolutely Kamala Harris if elected she would be the first female vice president this so-called last glass ceiling Does that matter to you at all that she's a woman?
"But his campaign wants him to say, get out the vote early here in Georgia, as early voting is underway behind me three weeks to go until the election is left."
Take a look at one example.
So there is that kind of symbolism in their view of that event but you also hear from people on the ground here eager to turn the page from Butler kind of wanting people to associate Butler with October 5th and not July 13th.
"Chris Stierwald's commentary offers an insightful breakdown of why Pennsylvania is a crucial battleground state, elucidating the factors that could decisively influence Harris's prospects for victory."
Tiny changes.
" Hello everyone, today I'm back with some surprising poll results that show just how tight the presidential race between the two candidates is."
"Professor Sprinson says it's fitting that Pennsylvania is a battleground state, representing many of the political divides and splits seen nationally."
"First, the Democratic campaign is very sophisticated here."
I've walked the floor.
"Well, it goes like this."
"If he wins it, you know, we have five months to go, but things are not looking good for Joe Biden."
A win there could be a big indication of just who will win the election overall.
"I want to go down to Caitlin Huey Burns joins us just outside of Philadelphia, covering former President Trump's town hall."
And I think that Trump wins.
I love our Constitution.
I have a hard time believing you are a Reagan Republican.
The evidence that has come out says that the suspect is a registered Republican who at one point in time donated to something that might indicate support of the Democratic Party.
But right now they're not getting the thresholds.
"Now, there is not."
"And three, we've got Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's going to ride this till the cows come home."
"So Raymond, I really appreciate this."
"You tell a lie often enough, and it's not that people believe the lie, but they don't care about the truth anymore."
That was his lead in May.
God bless you and your family.
"Adriana, it was a series of explosive sounds just about five minutes into the President's rally, the former President's rally here in Butler County, Pennsylvania."
Early voting in the Keystone state is painting a fascinating picture with Democrats surging ahead.
Those are just a few.
You can see the difference at this point.
So does that discredit this current Quinnipiac poll and Trump is actually leading in Pennsylvania?
"It was a sequence, a fast sequence of explosive as somebody had lit off 10 or 12 fire crackers in a row and it's easy to conflate firecrackers and some types of gun rounds."
Immigration has been the through line of his campaign.
Kamala Harris received 50 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 48 percent.
That's a Harris point three.
It will liberate.
All labor.
A little bit.
They say she was a beautiful woman.
We've got the best sellers.
"A lot of times, if you want to have a good read, you have to wait to get the information."
"Hey there, Caitlin."
We want to move a net-zero moratorium into the Overton window here.
"So the more you look at it, the more it becomes apparent that Trump's in a good position here."
Like it's this it's a huge thing for Republicans and it is very good.
It's just a stage.
"I share our occupations as an introduction to explain the challenges due in large part to the inflation that we have seen, that we have witnessed and experienced both as a producer and a retailer and also a consumer."
We talk every night and have a good time.
"Well, Republicans, they are above 25%."
"I think Pennsylvania has been really, really important for the Democratic Party for quite some time."
"And in part, that's why you've seen Vice President Harris here in downtown Pittsburgh since last Thursday preparing for the debate."
"The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall."
"Yada, yada, yada."
Trump is going to be strong.
Where do you have any idea where the breakdown was?
"You know, if you get Georgia and Pennsylvania, you don't even need Wisconsin."
"And isn't it, I don't know what the right word is, but like the two guys that shot at Trump was what?"
Morgan's support is rooted in her advocacy for workers' rights and her belief that Harris will fight for fair wages and better working conditions.
So let's steal from The New York Times right here.
She is the Vice President.
"Today, the choices Kamala Harris and Donald Trump."
"Now Kamala Harris is in fact late into the race, has managed to put together one billion dollars."
This is the news.
You had somebody who supports gun control that won like an R plus 20 district.
"Well, you scroll down here and look at that."
"Would that be okay, North Carolina?"
Do something about it.
"If you look at the totality of the recent polling, the CBS poll yesterday, the Say 24, Ugov project, and the CNN polls last week, I think you look at them all together, they suggest that Harris is opening kind of sort of a little bit of space in Michigan and Wisconsin, which means, as you've been discussing, if she can add Pennsylvania, she gets to exactly 270."
I wish they did.
"Yet right now, Trump's up by just under half a point."
He was the seventh most bipartisan member of Congress during his time in office.
An astronaut and a fighter pilot.
"And finding entertainment news, Sam Morelos plays Nikki Velasco in the Netflix sitcom That Nighty Show."
He spoke at the Detroit Economic Club laying out his agenda.
I believe that he has not gotten the full credit for the accomplishments he's done in office.
"While everyone else has the race tied or a small Trump lead, these garbage polls found Harris up by by some miracle three to five points."
"And look, I mean, the guy he's running against, like just he's just like not from here."
The moving average still looks a little bit higher than one point.
"Well, they need know it's said all the ti years."
"Kelly and her husband and her sister, Don accepted Corey's mom Karen to distraught."
I'm having fun with this Trump's hood.
"And in Pennsylvania, it was called a red mirage, because it looked like Trump had all these more votes because they didn't count the absentee votes until that day."
"I think the shy Trump voter was always kind of like a false way of explaining it, especially as pollsters nowadays typically don't poll by phone as much as they used to."
It's literally the tarred candidacy.
Here's Donald Trump maybe taking a swipe at JD Vance talking about couches.
Just doing whatever.
"I'm telling you, but Trump's not sitting plus point three."
"If they found a 40 point shift with these voters, which we know it's it's basically old Catholics that are taking this poll more than likely."
They are more similar to them in social policy ideas But they're just very different because they don't want to be like Russia's underling like they were back in the Soviet Union's days.
That's who Kamala is.
Didn't do it.
But I think this also applies to illegal aliens.
I did think I thought Kate Gallego was kind of a standout in those intros.
And together we'll keep building a country that's more fair and more equal and more just and more free.
And take a guess who these polls are.
"Trump is as fiery as ever, focusing on his core supporters and trying to lock in those votes."
"And as I said, show me the data."
That's wonderful.
They know it's political.
"From NBC News, local Republicans reject Trump's claims about Haitian immigrants in their towns."
You want to see more about this?
Just intentionally saying the name wrong.
You know how it goes.
"And yet when he has the opportunity to express power, he decides not to pass some comprehensive and less expensive health care plan, not to add jobs, not to pass the infrastructure law, not to pass a middle class tax cut, but use all of his political capital solely for a tax cut for millionaires and billionaires."
"And you raised a great point, Leland, about Dr. Oz and whether he really believes in the ideology of this."
"It's not murder, but if a pregnant woman gets killed, it's a double homicide."
Former President Donald Trump at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks last night for a town hall.
Let's go ahead and take a listen to this.
So a lot of people think that Rasmussen is this right leaning pollster and it does have a right lean.
His brain is just not functioning.
I don't see Kamala bringing this.
So that's usually always been my experience.
"And the reality is, when you talk to then Harris campaign folks, they'll bring up, well, does he really answer the question?"
He'll probably win that runoff there in the third district.
And I think that's why a lot of people across the state want to know where we stand.
Maybe not.
"But in Michigan, it is the EV mandate, the electric vehicle mandate that is a job destroyer for auto workers."
The states already marked as solid blue or solid red are those deeply aligned with either side.
We don't know yet.
"But on top of that, we have good news out of Marist of all pollsters."
"So it was Pennsylvania, we can see."
"And I think he's going to gain with Hispanic significantly, especially among Puerto Ricans in the Philadelphia area, Philadelphia City proper in particular."
So that was pretty intense.
 This is Donald Trump who will be holding a rally in a bottler in Pennsylvania.
He was the worst host in the history of the Academy Awards.
"So so if he's up by two to three points in Pennsylvania, he is easily winning."
He's never not posting on on a truth social.
We did everything.
And Selena let's talk about some of these election experts that are right now expressing concern for Elon Musk's million dollar raffle right for registered voters in swing states who as Musk puts it have to sign a petition in support of the Constitution to be eligible I know that you asked the White House press secretary about that today what did she say.
Not all Trump parades are made equal.
I wish that we would get break the mold of what we've had.
And that is all I got to say for this video.
We reached out to both campaigns and they both gave us different statements about their approach to the Latino vote.
"Trump won the state by about 44,000 votes in 2016, and Biden flipped it in 2020 with a similarly tight margin."
Donald Trump has done brilliantly in the latest polls in Pennsylvania.

"Trump, I think, stayed out of the Timmons race in 22, but then he endorsed Timmons this time around."
Well that remains to be seen as you know Nora but certainly a very spirited conversation among these voters as they watch tonight's debate but clearly not all of their answers were not all of their questions were answered tonight so that is why I know that they should hear more.
"No, these are brand new voters."

It's a very important state for him in November.
"The other day, this was crazy, too."
What does this one show?
"The discussion pointed to rising challenges from gangs and criminal elements entering the country, suggesting current policies may be worsening these threats, warranting urgent attention from authorities."
That's the biggest problem for Trump.
But Trump still has many pathways to winning.

I know Kamala Harris can be that president for the entire nation and certainly for the good people of Pennsylvania.
"Trump's appointments of conservative justices to the Supreme Court have been popular with these voters, and his stance on social issues has helped solidify his support in the state."
In the line of sight of law enforcement snipers.
That's why I believe he was able to win Pennsylvania.
God is on the side of anything other than every single American.
"Let me know in the comments below, you guys know where I'm at."
That's not good news for Harris.
"You do this interview with Charlotte May the God and you go out there and you talk about how, you know, when it comes to reparations, well, you know, I'm open to it or something that effect or, you know, we're willing to look into that."

And so that's why I'm here.
Has any of that changed?
No one can predict the future.
"But the point is, is that that wasn't as much third party vote in Pennsylvania as there was back in 2016."
"But I think that there are, for a lot of people, they say, well, they said all this in 2016 about him, how he's going to be dangerous and all that kind of stuff."
Trump's hood.
"Speaking for myself, I do not condone violence in any way, shape or form."
"I tell them to be quiet because what we are told in Bible prophecy, many would take a stand for the Lord and for the truth in these last days because of the information contained in this book."

"Sources are saying that Kamala Harris's campaign has raised a staggering one billion American dollars as of September end, putting a war chest in a much stronger position than Donald Trump."
Democrats are only slated to spend 40 million dollars.
So we are basically doing a lot of the Democrat activities just to elect Republicans.
She's focusing on these northern battleground states to try to put up a fight against former president Donald Trump.
I want to play a little bit of what she said at a rally in North Carolina.

"So who do I trust insider advantage, which has a a decent track record, not perfect, but it's all right or Suffolk, which is a garbage pollster that doesn't know how to pull out of Pennsylvania and they they dropped a Harris plus three here, which is actually an improvement for Trump compared to 2020 and 2016 or I trust insider advantage."
I had spent the previous eight years cleaning up the mess that Republicans had left me.
And I think it looks favorable for the vice president.
"In terms of former President Trump, he is I mean, he's going all around the country holding tons of rallies and he's sticking to this message that, you know, Kamala Harris will destroy this nation if she's elected."
"Well, look, I think if you look at the people lining up to be surrogates for Kamala Harris, it's far more plentiful."
"Well, why are you actively trying to make it harder to pass legislation that prevents that potential voter fraud?"
They still have a voter registration advantage.
She certainly has shown no indication that she's going to go on a freewill interview spree.

This is among the reasons I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous.
Bye bye.
Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body.
A Republican's not going to win a campaign in California.

The western part of the state is more midwestern or upper midwestern.
"But of course, Latinos con Harris, the whole thing is just a disaster."

"Jim, thank you very much for being with me this morning."
"And if they don't, you tell them he's got concepts of a plan."
"And it's an advantage for Harris as this comes down to ads that are going to be playing across TV and across battleground states trying to reach these voters, get out the vote events that are making sure that it's not only about courting the undecided voters, but that the Harris campaign is also making sure that her base is strength is strong and that they're also turning out."
"Well, that's exactly right."

"We may need to wait a day or two, maybe more, who really knows at this point."
"And that's the challenge she has that that really lies ahead and that Donald Trump still gets to drive home regardless of what he says, regardless of who he offends."
At the heart of Trump's latest spiral was his failed attempt to rig Nebraska's electoral map.
Local media has reported the explosion was caused by a bomb carried by the lone fatality.
So modeling what has been working there to basically the federal level is something that we need to do with the Kamala Harris and Tim Walz ticket.
Now Trump is saying that he responded and he's saying that he was shot in the air.
I wish they were more diverse candidates.

"The Harris campaign has a very definite attitude that former president Trump, by denying the 2020 election and rhetoric on the campaign trail so far, makes him unfit."
"Alarming statistics revealed that 325,000 children are missing due to ineffective border policies, highlighting a significant humanitarian crisis and raising concerns about child trafficking."

"And he says, yes."
"You just heard from former American Express CEO, former President Bill Clinton, and of course Vice Presidential Nominee Tim Walts laying out the Democratic Party's economic messaging this week at the DNC in Chicago."

Do you think inflation maybe has a little bit to do with the record high stock market?
"But just to give you a sense of just how close these are, the state is in terms of the polls, we can put up the latest RCP average."
Recent polling from AARP presents a fascinating snapshot of this crucial state.

She she doesn't have a lot more opportunities to rise in the polls.
"I think The Washington Post said, would the real populist please stand up?"
That'd be so dope.
So that's all coming up later today.
How?

Or however long.
Pennsylvania is the big win.
"Republicans gained 21,000 new voters."
"So I would imagine she's talking about the odds of winning, of knowing who wins Pennsylvania at almost zero."
"It reflects a larger trend within American politics, where urban centers, often pulsating with youthful energy and progressive ideals, clash with rural communities that may feel marginalized and economically left behind."
"specifically what's Western, Pennsylvania Well, I think really it's I you know back in 2016 I dressed like a slob and I didn't have any hair and I've been saying this is gonna be really close It's gonna be incredibly close when it was the secretary Clinton and here we are in 2024 and I still dress like a slob I don't have any hair and it's gonna be very close right now too because it's a very stark choice here and there and And now I do believe Kamala Harris is going to prevail on that but we must we can't forget that Trump has an appeal in Pennsylvania and we need to make sure we show up everywhere and we need to come at them and Make the argument and a lot of the kinds of rooms that other times people aren't even going to showing up and that's what I've been Doing and that's what I'm going to be doing between now until the election right now And but people understand who Trump is and I don't know why some people might have that kind of appeal But after everything that we've done and what has happened whether it's the trail or whether it's the impeachment or whether it's what to do impeachment or January 6 or even after the assassination attempt all of those kinds of things I'm not really convinced that this debate's gonna change and then a significant kinds of way Well, I wonder I wonder if there is a way to change it you say people know who Donald Trump is."
There are some who think of Trump as from the lineage of David.
Because small businesses are actually bigger than big businesses when you add them all up.
It was just fake hype.
"There's 150,000, 146,000 independent votes for Johnson."
We're here to support our President Donald Trump.
But then Biden is a six point lead in Wisconsin.
How do they keep Pennsylvania voters engaged all the way up to Election Day?
"She has because the EPA tailpipe emissions regulation essentially mandates, is the de facto mandate that two thirds of the vehicles in eight years in the United States of America must be partially electric or fully electric."
"Look at what the end, especially it's fascinating that a lot of these polls are coming out of the New York Times again, because on October 18, 2016, the New York Times reported that Hillary Clinton had a 91 percent chance of winning against Trump."
It costs too much.

We'll have to chat again between now and November 5.
How about this?
"Their support, driven by a range of interests from health care and education to economic equity and environmental protection, reflects the diverse coalition Harris has built as she seeks the presidency."
I'm talking about a complete and total disaster.
"Even 1% in Pennsylvania, if it's much closer than this Quinnipiac poll, if it's actually more of a toss up, what if Jill Stein is the reason that Donald Trump wins Pennsylvania and thus wins the election?"
Great to have you.
We're going to take it back in November and it's going to get done.
There's a lot of debris around here too.
"Like this topic here about working class voters in the city of Philadelphia moving to the right, where you have 10 articles."
"In my opinion, kind of nervous."
Great to be here in the studio.
Somehow they're going to blame an entirely different demographic like the Democrats.
"In fact, it's a complete disaster for Harris because if the same point misaccurs and even then just half the polling miss, like, let's say fine."
"Look, even on the most contentious issues, I've always said there are good people of conscience on both sides of the abortion divide."
He helped me.
We're tired of the delays.
It's not just about plans or concepts of a plan.
 And welcome back.
It possibly could help her.
This our first rally.

"It sort of depends on like, you know, there was like back in the in the days where like Joe Lieberman was around and, you know, Evan Bayh."
"He'd say build the wall, lock her up, etc."
One issue which stands in stark contrast to Republicans' professed agenda is that they have been openly hostile to IVF.

Federman now says he doesn't want to debate Dr. Oz.

"Even after his departure from the paper in 2008, Kay continued to engage with politics through his blog and remained a mentor to many."
It was Joe Biden.
Thanks for checking out the ABC News YouTube channel.
Pennsylvania isn't just any state.
Both Harris and Trump are trying to sway as many undecided voters as they can.
So our goal is really to just support candidates both locally and on the national level that represent our values.
It's a key part of his appeal here.
"We can make arguments while still saying, I love you and I'm going to listen to you."
"And I think people are trying to get things on the momentum, but also to look at who her opponent is."
"And I do think this debate, just remember the last debate with President Biden, that changed everything."
"And Jay, Harris is getting some good polling this morning in the Sunbelt states."
"It straight up calls out the Harris campaign for being, quote, poorly run in Pennsylvania."
She's a beautiful woman.
So we're just eight days away from the first presidential debate between Harris and Trump.
"Yeah, he's probably the clear favorite at that point."
And there's all sorts of scenarios here.
It was chaos.
The 90 minute debate will have no studio audience.
He can do anything he wants?
We made some critical investments there.
"Every legal scholar felt and felt for a long time for 53 years, they've been trying to do it."
"Well, speaking of New York, the weather this week has been crazy."
What else did you find in your polling?
"It is a battleground state, it's tied and has the largest number of electoral votes."
Some of them were taking extra books and stuff.
Both candidates received an equal number of votes in this poll.
So we got to reverse that.
"The birds are back, baby."
And it's interesting that President Biden now has been trying to tie the Republican Party writ large to what he terms the MAGA movement.
 Right now Kamala Harris's weeks old presidential campaign got a massive jolt of energy from an electric rally Friday here in the valley.
"Now you know that they're nervous because if you take a crawl across the internet right now, what do you see?"
"This is much more simpler than, oh yeah, by the way, Trump cannot afford to lose Wisconsin if he does."
It's not going to work.
Climate change is the single greatest threat facing our world today.
"By highlighting the court's decision as evidence of their commitment to preventing fraud, Trump's campaign can continue to push the narrative that the 2020 election was flawed and that they are actively working to address these issues."
"And get this, their data right now showing a slight lean toward Republicans."
Pennsylvania is the ballgame.
What was it?
Physical mental stamina to do the job.
I survived the shooting.
We got shot and we had the current date as well.
Their poll was Biden plus seven.
You mad.
You can lose everything else.
"Muhlenberger, I guess, Rasmussen and Susquehanna."
"We must, the Constitution is hanging by a thread."
"Trump's rhetoric, the former president's comments that he's making, especially it's something that I really drilled down with McCormick about."
"So if you're going just the polls, I'm gonna do quick math in my head."
If I can get in just to see Trump.
But you're not going to hear that from Republicans like David McCormick because they're afraid to condemn what he says when he insults people and denigrates even those who served our country.

"Northeastern Pennsylvania, Harris's prospects are dicier."
"I care about a whole host of issues, I care about a whole host of issues, as many American Jews do."
There we go.

"The fifth poll was conducted by TIPP Insights between October 7 and 9 among 1,079 registered voters."
"So if you're a Democrat, you have to look at that number and say, that's pretty good."
Our courts are rigged.
That that's what they found.
Was it last year?
"Vance, Ohio, to more stops in Pennsylvania than anywhere else."
"McCormick would look directly at Senator Casey saying this, face it, Bob, you are a liberal."
The other president?
"The statistical tie with Fox News, Sussacwon, Rasmussen, Mollenburg, Marist, et cetera."
What's about to happen?
"You know people who are conservative, who didn't vote for me, who didn't agree with me."
"You think about not winning in places like this, but doing better in places like this than Democrats have been doing in recent elections."
We need him.
"The first one is, does her campaign think she needs to get an even higher percentage of that?"
"So I think when you see those voters, that's more of a good sign for Brian Fitzpatrick's turnout operation than anything else."
"It's only one point lead, but it's another pollster that's not bad."
We did much better the second time than we did the first time.
 Pennsylvania found itself at the heart of American politics once again with a visit from Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.
"And while it may not be the margin the Democrats were hoping for with Shapiro, its 19 electoral votes will still end up in the Kamala Harris column."
"Mind you, this is supposed to be the premier security detail on the planet."
In response to recent news coming out about Trump sending Vladimir Putin COVID tests in 2020 during the shortage You posted on X saying that these reports quote would be an electoral game-changer in a normal country What do you mean by this claim in like normal country?
"But the point here being, you know, we're under attack in the polling numbers right now."
"And, you know, it's just, we work hard to make, make a dollar and the dollar isn't even the dollar nowadays."
"You saw folks excited, energized."
But it's like you have all these other people.
Like they're finally taking this seriously.
"And I cannot also ignore the fact that Tim Walz being added onto the ticket has done phenomenally, found a phenomenal thanks for Kamala Harris's campaign."
Wait.
"This has been a fascinating look at how local politics, cultural understanding and even money can make or break a campaign."
And Donald Trump has been part of that.
"Well, fundamentally, the security presence here, as you can imagine, is extremely enhanced."
What's that all about?
"Harris, however, has since walked back her earlier stance, clarifying that she now supports the continued use of natural gas, particularly in light of the Inflation Reduction Act, which opens new gas leases."
"Some of them are not even applying for aid they're eligible for because they believe that, well, there's no point, because I'm not going to get help."
He got he got guts and he's not scared.
"So Gen Z, let's take our seat in our democracy and cast our ballots."
"And meanwhile, Donald Trump and his running mate were making up stories, circulating stories about how the Biden administration was withholding aid and not giving it to Republican areas and giving it to undocumented immigrants, just making stuff up."
Only one of these births.
"I want each other's names because you shared a commitment to democracy, a commitment to personal freedom, a commitment to public education, a commitment to infrastructure."
This is my second.
"So for Trump to be in a good position to win Pennsylvania, it bodes very well from the win the presidency."
It's policy over personality for me.
"So you focus on the people who are already oriented to do the right thing, but may need that nudge."
That resonates here.
We won it twice.
"He said, would the war be over if you were president of the United States?"
The candidates are gonna wanna be everywhere in Pennsylvania and Pennsylvanians are gonna wanna judge them and then go to the polls.
I will see you next time.
I just say vote for vote for America.
"I know there are some women that say, I don't know, I just can't vote for Donald Trump."
Now we have less than eight months to go and Donald Trump is leading in Pennsylvania.
How amazing was that?
"And two weeks later, right here in the great state of Pennsylvania, Pow!"
It makes you a patriot.
"So like I just I'm so annoyed by the double standard of this man who, you know, clearly there's a part of me that thinks he'd be OK if she lost Pennsylvania so then he can challenge her next election cycle."
I'll ask a political expert what the candidates have to do to convince voters they have the best plan for their pocketbooks.
GOP 100% Dems 15% percentage shine LMAO.
Democrats won.
And so McCormick has that edge where he can just blame Casey.
"By ensuring that mail-in ballots are subject to strict requirements, the ruling may reduce the number of ballots that could otherwise be counted for democratic candidates."
"But you look at Erie County and you look at Northampton County, it's roughly in line with what those polls are showing."
"Anywho, yeah, but you have to understand for a lot of the people that are being told that they make a middle class income and they're like, well, I can't be poor."
And the RNC is investing in a lot of election security measures.
"We've seen things declassified and stuff like that over the years in the cia, right?"
It's down there to lawyers to represent the illegal immigrants that come into our country.
"Danny, good morning."
"Right, every vote matters in Pennsylvania."
"The North Carolina governor seems very comfortable in his own skin and does not seem to have very strong ambitions to be president, McClelland said."
"And he's not, but here's the thing, North Carolina, and he's not being transparent with the voters."
They got a lie in it.
And so they just kind of tear everybody on our side down instead of lifting people up.
So that matters to them.
"And Pennsylvania was ultimately decided by a very narrow 80,000 votes with the mail-in ballots and everything else that was going on."
"So there's a tremendous support here with the people coming in, regardless of the color cookie."
I've witnessed it.
"With its 19 electoral votes, it is the state where former President Trump and Vice President Harris are spending the most time and money, a combined $436 million, between them and their allies."
"It's a lot of like text online, you know, mixed modes, that sort of thing."
So you give them one or two point sample increase because they always under sample.
Both candidates are putting a lot of time in Pennsylvania.
Hot stars.
So here's the first question for you.
Same thing with Georgia because you have Trump versus Biden.
"That's one of the most important things in a democracy, is having an election and then admitting when you lose."
"I know we do the cliche, it all comes down to turnout, but it really does when everything is effectively even."
"But of course, she's a beautiful woman, so we'll leave it at that, right?"
So I don't know what she's going off on about.
"Packed for the future, adopted by acclamation, a declaration calling for action for future generations, a symbol of the beginning of change within the U.N. itself."
"That was in 2022, winning by an eye-catching 14 points."
This is 2024.
"And in teaming up with Mark Kelly, man, that's a powerful one-two punch right there."
They mostly come out at night.
We've had enough of that negativity.
Can Trump avoid going there?
It's also kind of overwhelming.
"And I think that's created by the political class in the media, which am I humble opinion or one and the same number far go any further."
"I put tariffs on China, but I put 27.5 percent."
"Biden, who was planning to stay in Delaware for the weekend is returning to the White House earlier as planned so he can continue receiving briefings from law enforcement."
"She was seen talking, even hugging, a lot of voters there inside those stores."
"And there's a significant, although shrinking, rural population, white voters without college degrees who make up Mr. Trump's base still account for roughly half the vote."
How's it looking now?
She was actually their Latino coalition manager.
"Now with less than a month from election day, what is it that's keeping these undecided voters from knowing for sure, yes, I'm going to vote for Harris or yes, I'm going to vote for Trump?"
And that's the issue of fracking.
Let's go.
We'll go with that.
Because elections typically ramp up after Labor Day.
"Well, no... Just saying."
Reuben worked on that.
"I mean, I can't even imagine what the big channels that cover politics all the time because everybody was live, by the way."
It's not sugar.
Donald Trump sees that as an enemy.
"Well, now they released a poll out of Pennsylvania that has Trump up by a point."
But could today's rally push Donald Trump even further ahead in the key swing state while turning now to news nations Robert Sherman at that rally in Western Pennsylvania.
"Now that I've voted for who you wanted me to, can I have food and water, please?"
"There's one other of that, you know, literal ping pong counties, Northampton right here in the northeast part of the state."
We just said a side Kamala Harris point five said victory.
"Former, or excuse me, President Biden only dropped that out of the race less than a month ago."
I'm here to solve problems.
What we say and the messages we send have an impact in the real world.
I will look at it at the time I'm not looking at anything now.
Then Donald Trump takes the mic again.
You want to take a look at Erie County.
So we are running like I.E.
"But in these closing days, that has been notable as we're getting closer to the election."
That's how Donald Trump labels Chuck Schumer.
She ended up getting 26 compared to her pulled 15.
But the fact remains that Trump has not disassociated himself from her as much as some of his supporters will.
"Trump yells, fight, fight, fight."
He sent somebody to his golf course.
What does Trump say when he's there?
"It's a tied race, but the problem for Harris is those undecided voters, they lean heavily towards Trump."
"I don't know how to tell you this, man."
"I really believe that she should hold tight and true to the strong part of the Democrats message, which is that we have we have a border bill that we presented to this president who Johnson and he vetoed."
"Having covered so many rallies this year, that is something that only not only animates his supporters, but is animating this campaign."
"So without wasting much time, let's get right into it."
"Somebody else has got Oh, you know who it probably is."
"Crazier things have happened, but Pennsylvania is a critical state and I think both campaigns realize that that's why they're both spending 300 million dollars."
They're covering him.
I didn't know the context.
Trump had about 62% to Secretary Clinton 33.
What's the name?
You could not make this stuff up.
And you're seeing those numbers.
"Bram Resnick, 12 News."
"Again, you have folks who very much do support the vice president."
That's not even counting the crimes he committed.
"But this is basically a Trump sales tax that could cost the average family almost $4,000 a year."
So I don't know if Kamala really kind of has many more opportunities.
"And drink your, drink something if you got it."
Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged by all-time favorite chart and let's listen to Pavarotti sing Ave Maria.
They loved everything about him.
"Harris's challenge lies not only in maintaining democratic turnout in these pivotal counties, but also in crafting messages that resonate with moderate and undecided voters who may feel alienated by the prevailing political discourse."
"Whereas Harris, she could win every other state yet losing the scenario."
 Thanks for joining us on six news at five.
"Over the last couple of years, my friends and I have shared concerns over the economy."
By the way get out there and vote.
"And I think people just realized that if you factor in all the data in 2016, 2020, you get this new Raspies and pull Trump three plus three in Pennsylvania."
That's a point three margin.
It's a shame because I think...
"I believe it's good for us to get money Money's part of fracking when and you just can't make this up her running mate called her Prostituted young prostitute or that may it makes sense You know, it makes sense."
Is there something wrong here?
"Favorability, the catch-all for what voters think about the candidates from policy to personality to promise, tips Harris way since we last polled Pennsylvanians."
Like there's this quote from Ryan Boyer.
What are the odds?
"Well, I'm actually going to quote Congressman Greg Stanton from that rally who said, don't believe the polls."
That's a self-imposed deadline by Vice President Harris.
"Like, have they recalibrated polls?"
And Mark and Matthew.
"No, I'm not disappointed maggot."
Put down your phone and do what?
I got here at around eight.
Guns take away their right to free speech.
I think women are going to decide this election.
"To this day, I still don't really get it, how anybody voted for him back in 2022."
The world's full of amateurs.

"So if you're polling high, there's not a high odds that your numbers are fake."
"Jay, let's start with you."
"I couldn't be more proud to serve as the governor and to have earned the votes, not just of Democrats, but Republicans and independents as well who propelled me to victory each time I've run for office."
Really?
"Thank you very much as well, man."
But do you find it just a little bit odd that it's every poll finding the shift every single one?
"Now, for those that don't know, back in 2020, the state of Pennsylvania, at least the electorate, was roughly 27 percent Catholic and Trump won Catholics in Pennsylvania by around 11 points."
"Faint political writer at the Los Angeles Times, Sima Mehta, told us both candidates are sharpening their attacks in those key states, even though, you know, obviously this is a national election, but ultimately it's going to come down to a handful of battleground states."

"I think when people feel that they're not being represented or heard, then you will find that people will make extreme decisions, which is obviously outrageous."
"Daniel, Pennsylvania is one of the seven of those toss-up states in this year's election."
"You can clearly see though America was always polarized in the sense that there are red states which vote the Republican way, primarily in the Midwest."
And the acknowledgement that the Harris-Walls ticket is that forward path is what's really moving people.
"However, I don't think they're completely worthless."
I think it's too soon to say What?
"So please, if you don't like Donald Trump, totally get it."
Immigration has scared me.
"But as a percent of the returns, they are down or at least they're going to be down by a lot."
"And if you made me come up with a list, North Hampton County and Erie County, one in the eastern part of the state, one in the northwest corner, those would be on my list."
"And number two, the socioeconomic situation that we find ourselves in favors a populist platform like Trump's in places like Pennsylvania, in places like Nevada."
You know why?
"And, you know, analysts believe former President Trump's endorsement clinched J.D."
"I mean, there's a lot of great candidates that could easily get a Trump endorsement."
But I'm not sure yet that it's really sunk in.
They were required to issue leases under the Inflation Reduction Act.

"Georgia has only recently become competitive, North Carolina They have it once since Obama So those are the three states that are the most kind of straightforward path if she wins those she doesn't need anything else provided nothing else flips and so that's the most logical path and It appears to be the way that she's going to be most efficient a couple of important events on the campaign trail as we were just Showing our viewers on Bloomberg TV tomorrow Donald Trump high noon interview right here on Bloomberg TV and radio with our editor-in-chief John michaels wait Wednesday Kamala Harris sitting down for an interview with Brett bear on Fox News These are two important conversations that will be following closely and we'll invite you to our special coverage tomorrow starts 1130 Eastern Time As we walk up to the interview with Donald Trump now We want to turn to the Middle East another important story We're following today with some updates the Pentagon Announcing the US is sending more troops now almost a hundred along with an advanced missile defense system to Israel to help protect from attacks Coming from Iran this comes as Israel has yet to retaliate for the barrage of missiles that Iran fired earlier this month We spoke earlier today with former NSC official Hagar Shemali on the early edition of balance of power It is something that is meant to beef up that that that security to definitely send a message across to all Across the Middle East that the US is going to defend Israel is going to stand and support Israel You know in case of any kind of attack But it certainly indicates that there is they they are expecting something and they want to be there just in case Joined now by Bloomberg's Michelle Jim Risco at the table with us in Washington Michelle We've had a couple of updates not only that defense missile missile defense battery I should say on its way to Israel with dozens of Americans who will be there to run it But Benjamin Netanyahu according to the Washington Post Now saying that Israel will strike the Iran military when it responds We're not sure when that happens and that's as opposed to oil installations or nuclear facilities Does the Biden administration then in fact have some influence after all?"

He will take away that $35 cap on insulin.
"And so what we could see here is actually a lot of the people were also who were helping Cornel West in a lot of these states were actually Republicans, like Republican operatives who were like showing up to these electors houses."
These poll results highlight a tight race between Trump and Harris in Pennsylvania.
"Amish f conservative, their quali everything to them."
That's what they're trying to make.
Otherwise we'd be flooded with Chinese cars and and all of our factories would close would have no jobs at all in the auto industry.

It's great to have you both.
"They're both different goals, but they can both achieve their goals in one debate."
Russell's contribution represents a significant investment in Harris' campaign and highlights her confidence in Harris' ability to bring about meaningful change.

Well she's found herself in hot water again and this time it's thanks to a little something from 2019 that has come back to haunt her.
I'm amazed.
So it's another big one as well.

"As we are speaking now, it's been a year since the October 7th, you know, Hamas attack on southern Israel and all that has transpired since then."
There were some awesome people there in her stay.
A lot of chanting and they're just eagerly waiting for Donald Trump to get here and you can hear that cheering when Trump's plane flew over the Butler farm show.
I feel everybody lying.
They're the ones that are going to be knocking on doors and chasing all of those votes.
"And we don't use the least fortunate amongst us at punchlines for our jokes because they're our neighbors, our neighbors."

"It's going to be the, this is the best Trump is polling by far."
And so he's not playing the greatest hits.
"We're much better prepared today, four years later, than we were."

He's a total poser.
"Now, the other thing about this state today that I think is interesting, we're going to talk about this a little bit later in more detail, is the Senate races, because Casey, the Democratic senators, is in a tough race."
Pennsylvania is a really important one.
"A month and a half ago, Kamala Harris was not the presidential nominee."
"Right now, what are the key issues that see economy?"
"He was pro-choice a couple years ago, pro-red flag laws a couple years ago, pro-mask in 2021, pro-jab."

"I don't like the fact that because I say that I'm a conservative and because I say I'm a Republican, I'm treated with disdain."
"If you win it, you're basically guaranteed the presidency."
He understood how to sell it.
It's a very wild situation.
I get what you're saying.
"So Pennsylvania, that is the choice in this election."
I don't see Joe Biden bringing this.
Harris finished five points ahead of Trump in this poll.
"Couple of things that stand out behind that, right?"
What are they saying when they're coming into your bakery and buying these delicious cookies?
"Meanwhile, Joe Biden, the un-convicted felon, now he's officially raised a convicted felon with the whole Hunter thing, and of course it's a red herring."
He had some advertising to be effective.
I do what I want and I'm not responsible for anything.
He just wants to remind people of that.
We had the date.
"We saw that Biden, some of these should have been Biden, Democratic supporters were kind of parking their vote with RFK Jr. or sitting on the sidelines."
"But that being said, there was the the idea was like regardless of where you put the filibuster, like they reduced the filibuster, you know, from 66 to 60, I think during that era, regardless of where you put the filibuster, a guy like Lieberman is going to put himself as the 59th or 60th vote."
And it is a bare minimum.
"And I personally have said, I really am worried about this election."
"Were you surprised that in a speech billed as being about the U.S. economy, Trump did veer off into so many other topics, even spending a lot of time talking about his former opponent, President Biden?"
This is a prosperous area in many respects.
"Yeah, it's a good question."
But here's the thing about this.
"Beautiful town of Asheville, North Carolina was fucked."
It's gotta be somebody in there.
How in the world did they miss a 20-year-old kid with an AR laying down on a roof less than a kilometer away?

"so literally anything is super important and I think um Trump strategy is to sort of like alienate as many well not strategies Maybe not doing this on purpose But the Trump campaign keeps alienating more and more groups and so a common strategy appears to be to make a bigger and bigger tent So a bigger tent that she or a bigger group that she's opening up the tent to now is moderate Republicans Another group also, you know, like for example Trump is sort of alienating I guess a lot of JD Vance is doing a lot of it to where he was saying that you know Like grandmother's only role was to raise children and you know, childless women cat ladies or whatever He's they're alienating as many groups as humanly possible."

His campaigns messaging around restoring order and promoting economic growth could resonate well in these demographics.
"I love you, Philly."
Tim cast music.
"It's probably going to come down to Pennsylvania, but right now, look, everything has been positive for Kamala Harris for the last about what, eight, nine days."
I do listen to her music.
"And these Secret Service, they jump right in there while shots are being fired."
"On the first day of returns, it was 19% Republican, 72% Democrat."
They're going to hold out as long as they can.
I have faith they will.
What makes you so excited to be at a Trump rally?
"She had the other interview with the other guy who was a nice guy, I think from Philadelphia, from Pennsylvania."
"But if she refuses to certify and then makes herself president, you'd be OK with that?"
"Dave, I've been in your your great Commonwealth now two weeks in a row."
And then he just stands there for like minutes listening to these songs.
"The Trump campaign should throw everything at the state, not just invest some resources."
We're going to bring them over directly.
"It was the incredible example of Polish heroes throughout history that inspired the final words of my speech to brave Poles on July 6, 2017."
I feel very strongly that U.S. Steel needs to remain a U.S. company and that the people working there need to be American workers.
You can bet your bottom dollar somebody is there.
"I mean, people are just piling in already."
"And I assume a lot of people in the district didn't know either, but this is the latest coat."
So I wish I could tell you that this presidential race is going to be exciting.
What does that look like?
We would be on track to winning.
Do you think that Pennsylvania was a battleground state when Biden was in the race?
And that is dangerous.
"That was a huge focus of the interview that she did with Call Her Daddy, this very popular podcast, particularly in the South and the Midwest."
It reinforces what we heard a couple of days ago.
"After migration, economy and abortion, race has made an entry in the race for the White House."
"We're all in a row here on the rafters above the stage, above the seated area."
"There's got to be somebody that genuinely cares about us and has real policies and real ideas, that are realistic."
"Whichever of these two candidates wins Pennsylvania is very likely to be the next president in the United States, and they are going all in."
We even have polls with Donald Trump winning the popular vote in some polls that have been very hostile to him or he's tied in the popular vote in those polls.
"But major, I can say after traveling with the Trump campaign for the past several months now, this is when they are starting to target these areas."
He picked Al Gore.
And then I went back to the White House and I started throwing hamburgers at the wall.
We are ready for a President Kamala Harris.
They wanted to support small business and the numbers were wrong.
"And Terry, one more thing, if you don't mind, I want to drill down on this idea of Pennsylvania and some of these Republican heavy counties, because the Trump strategy is to run up the vote totals in places like where he is now in Johnstown, which can be a swingish city, but it's in a county that's heavily Republican and it's surrounded by counties that are heavily Republican."
It's a code and it's a broken.
Somebody's getting 15 years.
Trump won this state by almost a point.
They're not sending him to Michigan.
They highlight this meeting that Harris's campaign had with Latino leaders.
And that's why they didn't have mail-in ballots here in 2024.
"Now, at this hour, you guys, it is pretty quiet, but we know that could all change in a matter of minutes, hours, or just any moment."
Five out of the six were one in 2016 and Nevada is probably one of the most likely states to flip ironically just given trends to the Republican column.
"By the way, in Reading."
That's a place where trading out Biden for Harris was probably a downgrade for them.
"And if you look at the East Coast and the West Coast, there are blue states which have traditionally been the belt or the bed of the Democrats."
"Both Michigan and Wisconsin right now pretty much are states that look like they are going to be in the blue column, but if we look at a lot of the polling, it shows that Pennsylvania might be a little bit more of a toss-up, maybe even go into the Republican side."
"Our own Julie Serkin caught up with both candidates ahead of tonight's meetup, and she joins me now from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania."
You can lose Nevada.
"Appreciate you, Jay."
My values have not changed.
I've got a problem with that.
"Does people, do people, oh, you know, Charleroi."
And it was Republicans who won it.
"For the most part in Hawaii, for the most part at large in New York, just not going to happen."
So let's cool it on the David.
"Nearly 61,000 people have registered to vote in North Carolina since Biden stepped out of the race."
The people that came up to the drive-thru while Trump manned it were hand-picked by the campaign.
"And throughout every chapter in our American story, when we have been tested, we've put our country first, we've put our patriotic tendencies first."
"Kadyrov plans to deploy the Cybertruck in the Russian-Ukraine war, praising Musk as a modern genius and inviting him to visit Chechnya."
We're very much very much aligned.
I've been a resident here since 2007.
"Americans think that Donald Trump is the only person, everything is rigged."
Secret Service.
"So when you look at the numbers, is it advantage Democrats in your state?"
And people see that and they're not sure what the truth is.
And then she just took over whoever this thing is.
"Meanwhile, a New York Times-Siana poll now shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in three key battleground states."
I have to tell you guys about readygopolitics.com.
It's kind of crazy.
And I'm Ainsley Earhart.
"Yeah, this is Trump's hood."
"I know we got to go, but I think it's important because this is happening in states, especially battleground states."
"So you go to Pennsylvania, you set up shop there, and what do you do?"
"During his Pennsylvania rally, Trump went off on a tangent about Oprah, who he claimed used to be a friend until he entered politics."
I don't know why this car keeps waiting here.
You are kind of like a lap dog for the Republican nominee.
"Well, there is a brand new poll released out of Notre Dame, you know, a very Catholic university."
"So You know, I was mentioning something about the wicked demon abstein, you know what i'm saying?"
I think that's her goal tonight.
"And abortion was the top response, 22 percent, above immigration, above cost of living even."
And that was brutal because we could have got a really massive upgrade there.
You wouldn't even have to shoot him.
"With less than 100 days to the election, Reading's residents are paying attention and feel the weight of the decision ahead."
Patel believes that Harris' approach to housing policy will address the needs of the growing urban population and provide more opportunities for homeownership.
"So we'll have to see, guys."
It is.
And the one thing I'll say is they kept saying about what I said right after the insurrection.
"Both candidates have taken very hardened positions, maximalist positions."
Politics is downstream from cultures.
"You just said that about kick your his or, you know, we'll keep it going."
"Adams, who has long been an advocate for digital privacy and cybersecurity, supports Harris' policies on data protection and online security."
"They put the Rasmussen polls and yeah, if they put in Trafalgar, they're going to put in Rasmussen and that's going to push Trump ahead to you know, and there it is right there."
"On Saturday, Trump will hold a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, returning to the site of that first assassination attempt back in July."
He was super friendly and I had zero expectation.
"Ellis was one of 18 Trump allies who pleaded not guilty back in May to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges."
Thanks for waking up with us.
She's angry that Trump constantly attacks courts and judges and election results.
"But I'll tell you, I'm offended by that."
The shooter looks like came in from behind.
"Nathaniel, thanks for joining us."
Now it's basically tied Harris with a small margin there.
So we're going to have to hope that it's going to be able to survive the appeals.
"Does the White House worry that voters are going to sort of say, even discount what the president's saying more?"
Because those groups tend to vote more.
I'll read you the 87 percent of black voters have said they would vote for Biden.
He handpicked three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe versus Wade.
Still an advantage for Trump.
But she's even worse for the Jews.
But he did not take questions earlier as Governor Shapiro and Vice President Harris were said to be meeting Sunday in the nation's capital voters in his hometown weighed in on a potential Harris Shapiro ticket.
Pretty consistent if you ask me.
This is not good for Harris at all because if Republicans are now picking up steam and early voting and now this drops.
He'd like to come in and buy donuts.
And he's not the only one who feels that way.
"Look that way, three point two."
The number of lawyers on her staff is huge in comparison to what we saw with President Biden in 2020.
"Shapiro, however, outperformed Biden during his governor's race."
The make cat safe again design.
"I mean, in the sense that given the way our electoral college is structured, Kamala Harris needs to be at least three and a half to four percentage points ahead of Donald Trump because of the popular vote, she gets a lot of extra votes, popular votes in California and Illinois and New York, large states."
"He says it's like 107,000 people."
And it's not just Rasmussen.
"Now, in August, it could be a lot closer, especially with the quote unquote hair surge."
My name is Marcus.
In my opinion?
"And within that several thousand votes, we saw some polling that came out from the New York Times Sienna poll, which is generally kind of respected as one of the one of the better polls out there, which showed that Harris has a four point lead on Trump, which but at the same time, it said that they were tied nationally."
Sounds fantastic.
I find it very unlikely.
And then you have articles sounding the alarm.
"I think for me, like a lot of people, it's the economy."
I talked with many dozens and dozens.
Now the worst of the worst kind of human beings have already come out and expressed themselves on social media yay they're cheering on or oh my god I can't believe you missed number one somebody lost their life today and another person is fighting for their life.
There was a pretty large one.
"And so basically, right now is that their Democrats are being very competitive in Arizona, but they know it's one of the tougher states of the six battleground states."
There is a reason that these two issues were tied together in that Senate bipartisan bill because they really feel like they can leverage both.
And I think it's a good thing that we're going back to the presidential election.
"People are going to count quicker, the mail in ballots are going to be less, the mail in ballot requests are significantly less in a lot of these swing states."
"But the fact is, if she's doing this bad with Catholics in Notre Dame, what do you think is happening everywhere else?"
"Or maybe they'll be used for, you know, I don't know what they'll be used for exactly, but I know, you know, the government denied that they were going to do the long range missiles."
I want to play some tape.
"So it's a clear choice on rights, but it's also a clear choice on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, the tax code."
"Obviously, they weren't sizable enough to overtake him in the primary, but are they sizable enough to make the difference in the margins in the general election?"
 I want to zoom in on one voting block this morning.
"And that's where I think you see a stark contrast, right?"
"Akayla, good morning."
The cause of the blaze has yet to be determined.
And he has paid a lot of lip service to those states in the past.
This video is being shadow band.
"We've seen the Trump campaign kind of make it push in the last couple of weeks to focus on doing more digital streaming engagements, like podcast shows with very popular hosts."
So that's why I say it's very much with the vice president.
But it's like they give they've given her a chip and the factory settings is this story.
"That's Trump's base right there, right here."
So that's what happened there.
"We are likely to see, it may not be as dramatic in fact, I don't think it will be as dramatic in effect as last time, but it will still be something to watch more on election day that is likely those Republican in-person small county votes are likely to come in more quickly than, you know, the big urban areas or even the big suburban areas where Democrats are stronger."
"It's like, is it a different place?"
"That's why the off year elections in particular is tough to pull because you don't know, man."
"Voting rights and democracy, women's rights, workers rights, you could add to that list, obviously."
So is it now a fake poll or maybe just maybe the theory that there's been a response bias in polling is true.
"He's here, America's favorite fish."
Our conservative.
The great controversy above all the other books needs to be heard today.
"I'm a Christian, a wife, a mother of three, and a small business owner in that particular order."
But you give illegal taxpayer funded lawyers.
"It's going to be extraordinarily close in that state, along with many others."
"Right, yeah, we did certainly see that."
"But essentially, it's drilling straight down."
"So, so there was a little flavor a little flavor of the day for you."
Hillary was plus eight point two.
She's an election denier.
"Now, it's not a, I shouldn't say it's a guarantee."
"I mean, she was able to do it in the debate to talk about her own proposals and what her own priorities would be as president."
Hear me when I say.
They are good.
The focus on Pennsylvania isn't just about rallies.
It's a mentality.
"And when you look deep down in the numbers, Republican voters and especially those aligned with Donald Trump are very supportive of his argument."
"So in Allegheny County, the Democrats actually losing a percentage of the registered voters into that county."
"It is a vanishing species, however."
To see Trump would fill you with joy.
He delivered for them in his first term.
So the fact that the Kamala Harris team is on the ground in Georgia speaks volumes about where they think they've got some opportunities here.
Though even there his once-commanding lead has begun to slip.
So this is really big stuff and it's good.
"The variation in polling data across different areas reflects the state's diverse political landscape, with each region bringing its own set of priorities and concerns to the table."
" Okay, so you're trying to keep up with this election, right?"
His case in Florida is basically out the window.
I want to thank everybody.
They're going around Bethel Park.
Carmela?
"The question is, will Democrats be our own worst enemies, as is often the case, sadly?"
That's in the corner down by Ohio and West Virginia.
"Against Harris, he leads by just three, and in one of the most recent polls we've seen out of the state that's yet to be added to the average, I don't know if it will be, has Kamala Harris up one point in this state."
America doesn't want to go back.
And he did that.
We have six hundred thousand jobs in Pennsylvania from fracking.
Your prediction was a bit off.
It's like this is an etch a sketch campaign.
But it's good that we have this this victory at least here.
The event will see US Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz officially nominated as the party's ticket for the November election.
"Now, I don't want to over-romanticize our relationship."
"In 2020, Kamala actually had to pull out before it even went there because she couldn't even make the primary."
We win the whole.
"In fact, I actually believe compared to 2020 and 2022, you will see more Democrats vote on Election Day."
"Tim Ryan, the president, a Democrat, is in Cincinnati, Ohio."
Has that changed in 2024?
University of Pennsylvania professor Matt Levendusky says the state's urban-rural divide rolls into campaign strategy.
And Trump has this approach to endorsing which is very controversial.
How does he respond to some of that criticism?
We're being occupied by a criminal force.
She got old.
You'll be watching tonight.
These are the final numbers not 50 days before Election Day.
We had Homeland Security.
Their mail-in balance aren't coming in like they did in the past because people aren't enthusiastic about Kamala Harris and the entire Democratic ticket.
"And so I think Kamala Harris needs to make sure she's continuing to fight these legal matters right now and then obviously being prepared for what happens later, what comes later."
"Because as soon as it's connected, those cells join together."
"Now expanding to the largest lead we've seen in these three states, according to new polls here, that's good news for the Democratic Party."
Donald Trump is perplexed by the concept that two weeks ago he was talking about President Biden and now he's talking about Vice President Kamala Harris.
And the clock is ticking.
There's too much at stake to sit this one out.
"So suggesting that there may not be negative political fallout for him, at least when it comes to politics, on that decision to do that or that move to do that."
"Oh my gosh, look how many military people they have there."
Trump's a divider.
"In a place like this, they have lost jobs."
That starts with voting rights.
"But unlike Kamala Harris, I think Trump needs Pennsylvania."
"He got more than 93% of the vote, more than 616,000 votes doing better than Obama in 2012."
It shouldn't be that way.
And I think that's because there's still a whole cadre of left leaning pollsters that progressively moved Harris up week after week.
And he did not say yes.
They're not a representation of trans people.
"Tell act in all, tell by the way, that's going to blow up on her because Trump is playing dodgy, you know, and you watch how this is going to, Trump will destroy her in a debate."
" So Steve, we'll only get a few more of these big polls before election day."
Remember 2020?
"According to our CBS polling as well, the top factor when considering who voters will vote for is all about the economy."
It looks like about 10 shots were fired from the crowd.
As we move closer to November.
It has been nonstop attacks in that Senate race.
"Yeah, New Jersey versus New York will be the only case where instead of objection, the lawyers will shout, Oh!"
So I think she's going to do well.
"However, Pew's previous report showed that for the first time since the 1960s, the majority of Americans were not in the middle class in 2021."
Both candidates have found support in Pennsylvania in recent polls.
I made that very clear in 2020.
"And when they're there, they're going there primarily for Fitzpatrick and they make a decision in the booth probably as a protest vote against Trump more than anything else."
It's almost like the Republicans have an agenda.
But but the point is she she has no appeal to Catholic voters.
"Then come the Zurn, York, a big Republican counties."
"Yeah, absolutely."
"So if you are talking to friends and family and neighbors, and it's hard to have political conversations right now, sometimes families are getting divided."
"Oh, there's my great grandparents."
And this is as she tries to court Republican voters from moderate Republicans to Republicans who have turned against former President Donald Trump.
She'll be back in the state on Wednesday for another rally.
"Do you really think she can appeal to voters in Lackawanna Monroe, even Northampton?"
"Listen, I love the fact that in my state we uphold the Constitution."
The former first lady's absence from his public appearances continues to raise eyebrows.
"It's actually much better because everyone gets the Congressional Medal of Honor that soldiers, they're either in very bad shape because they've been hit so many times by bullets or they're dead."
But the only reason it's not like a Trump plus one lead is because of the Suffolk poll for those that don't know Suffolk University is one of the worst pollsters out there.
"Well, it's really kind of a striking dynamic in that."
"And then when Hillary Clinton came in, she went all the way down to 37 with Joe Biden at about 40% of the votes in 2020."
It's calm.
In contrast.
"These votes are going to be super Democrat and if you want to win Pennsylvania, you have to bank on these early votes."
"It's just a delicious way, I think, to get the stress off the election and all the political ads."
There might have been a week or two ago.
"His latest number crunching, leading him to the conclusion, you know, pal pink that Pennsylvania is no longer a swing state."
And people didn't like that.
I apologize.
"The number was like, what?"
It can be misleading because you do got a lot of ancestral Democrats and I agree with that.
"Let's bring in founder of bikers for Trump, Chris Cox."
We're also going to talk about those Trump tapes.
And Biden wants to ban assault rifles.
We had Secret Service.
They say they're completely flooded with money.
We're a nation in decline.
"They say, you know what?"
"And it's the big kahuna of the battleground states, 19 electoral votes, that whoever wins Pennsylvania is almost certainly likely to win the election."
"We tie this all together, right?"
"I mean, he is someone who really seems to not have any kind of vision for the future and is just focused on sort of the silliness of the past, settling old scores and a whole bunch of wacky conspiracy theories."
"The public's perception of her as a candidate, along with her ability to forge authentic connections with voters, will play a critical role in determining turnout and overall support."
"And so from then on, we had an election prediction, I released it right after the debate, showing Donald Trump with a 312 electoral vote victory over Joe Biden, a massive, massive gain compared to where it would be in 2020, and even a better performance than he had against Hillary Clinton."
But it's not just Harris who needs Pennsylvania.
Urging Trump to stay focused on issues like the economy and protecting the border.
So former President Donald Trump returning to battleground Georgia today for two campaign events.
"And I think the vice president is absolutely correct to not only call out his rhetoric, but to remind us that rhetoric becomes policy if he becomes president."
And then he calls the New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman.
I've been to these rallies and they get super excited while waiting in line.
"I have friends that are still trying to have children and that are at an age maybe where they do need, say, IVF, or they could have problemsome pregnancies and their life could be on the line because a judge or a lawmaker wants to make that decision for them."
"I mean, and epically so."
I'm not going to go super long.
"You don't believe that that leak last week because it almost looked like someone knew is going to, you know, someone said she's going to be meeting."
We're just under two months away.
"Security was exceptionally tight at the rally, reflecting the heightened tensions following the recent attempt on Trump's life."
"Harrisburg, Pennsylvania today, reporting to you live."
We talk about a lot of stuff.
"Um, Donald Trump."
"However, recent events have forced the Democrats to lose out on some of their voter base."
"Puberty, whatever the fuck it's called, came across my 4u page like two minutes ago with this heavily altered photo."
"And they had an interesting theory as to why Trump said the weird thing about how he's more attractive, right?"
"And as of now, in the RCP average comes up by 0.1%."
Now he is here in Pennsylvania over the weekend.
"Well, I think one of the things that makes Pennsylvania distinctive is precisely that it's not very distinctive."
Who kills this shit?
It's the greatest movement in the history of our country.
"As for Trump who courted the union in the past, the head of the union stated quote, I really don't give a F if he's pissed."
"No, these things are all planned."
"This would suggest it would be over a hundred K, but we would expect some of these people to show up and vote in person rather than the mail."
"Yeah, I think that's going to be a central question of this election because we've seen across the country since the overturning of Roe every time an abortion measure was on the ballot it has passed."
What is this all about?
Tonight there is a new poll from CBS News.
He's not with the status quo.
I think that they're much more worried than they're letting on at the moment.
"And if you're vice president Harris, you're seeing the surge of support among black women."
"So that book in particular is very, very good."
Taking the guy with the Trump's hood.
"Obviously, it's gonna be a very close election, but everyone was claiming that Trump was secretly down by 15 points in Pennsylvania that he was gonna lose the election."
We have also grown our support with women tripled and support among white college educated voters in that state.
She has direction and I think it evens a playing field for the two candidates.
The mainstream media is completely broken.
"And when you look at some of these places, yeah, Bucks County, I could see it get closer."
"Now, can he?"
We're ready for a better story.
Most of this is pointing at the marksman.
"Let's, let's rate this on a scale from one to 10."
"Hillary Clinton narrowly held them in the Democratic corner against Trump in 2016, each by less than 3 points."
"Al is leading that way, as are clerks all across Pennsylvania, Republican and Democrat alike, who are working very hard to make sure that we have integrity yet again in our process."
So who do you want representing America?
So has she succeeded with the Black voters?
"Criticism was directed at the military withdrawal from Afghanistan, emphasizing that military personnel should have been the last to leave."
We have the alternative logo t-shirt.
Then I guess he is for banning fracking once and for all.
"And in fact, they're accelerating."
Definitely banger Catch y'all next one
"Silver bulletin model, Donald Trump, very slight favorite in Wisconsin."
"Now, before I get going, you guys have to forgive me."
You don't even need Nevada.
Mastriano was actually there on January 6th.
Pennsylvania bakery cookie poll shows Trump crushing Harris.
Do you remember that?
Man that stays that assassination attempt man I ain't gonna lie about it you got 24 hours to stage your own assassination attempt in response.
"There was a lot of contrasting of, were you better off four years late, four years ago, which you could argue we're in the midst of a pandemic then."
That'll be a big hit.
"Yes, some of them are mad about my hair."
"Now, when the, when you look at it and you look at what's happening all over the country now, states are voting."
"So alienating local leaders in Philadelphia, it's not a good look for the Harris campaign."
"I've been seeing here, California, Texas, all over."
One exception was saying how she'd be different than President Biden.
Kamala Harris mentioned Poland when attacking Donald Trump during the last debate.
"Tim Walz may not massively expand on that margin, but it solidifies it in a way that would only be solidified by him or Governor Josh Shapiro, and does really good, really, really good for the Kamala Harris campaign."
The Democrats challenged to remove the requirement when the mail-in ballots be dated.
"OK, they're in a left wing cope."
I think I'd like to go over there by him.
I think they like me anyway.
"Yeah, look, I mean, it seems like maybe the one thing Kamala Harris and Donald Trump agree on is that Pennsylvania is the tipping point state, the deciding state."
Her willingness to speak directly to a community is a sign of respect.
Look at all this.
And she hasn't given a reason why she changed her position.
"I was recently talking to Karl Rove, and he was reminiscing about how many states as recently as the 2000 election they were playing in, either on offense or on defense, places like Tennessee or Kentucky that we no longer consider a West Virginia, even part of the dialogue."
We need more art.
Let's go win.
There is consistency in where Kamala Harris performs.
The economy was higher inflation was lower things were better overall and now with Kamala's Administration things haven't been so fantastic and she's saying she can fix the problems that her administration has caused But I just don't know if I can afford to take that risk Were you leaning towards the former president coming in tonight?
"And if you've got any confusion, any uncertainty about what your plan is to vote, then you go to iwillvote.com slash AZ."
"As we are speaking now, there is an aggressive military campaign going on in Lebanon, where your parents are from."
I cracked.
Harris also trying to reach out to conservative voters who aren't happy with Trump now agreeing to sit down with Fox News in Pennsylvania later this week.
"No matter where you are on the issues, how could you go along with that?"
Also this custom cowboy hat.
"But he says even though he hid classified documents that he stole, asserted every invalid, improper privilege that exists."
"And now to come along and say that the government has the right to tell you or you as a woman what you can do with your body, I have a problem with that."
I highly doubt it.
Hey Joe.
"Like, what are you talking about?"
I really believe that.
I think there was an upcoming storm.
"Only once in the past four presidential elections, Donald Trump's victory in 2016, did fewer than 90 percent of Pennsylvania's black voters support the Democratic nominee."
You're right.
And you're seeing enthusiasm right now.
I'm a skateboarder too.
"They're going to ask, you know, again, you saw Youngkin talking the other day about Trump's promise to go after Schiff and other radical left the United States with the military."
"And I would imagine as well, there's still a certain resentment that they turfed out one of their own to replace and replace her on the ticket."
"We need law and order and we need legal immigration, which President Trump has always been a proponent of."
Let's send him back to the United States Senate.
This can also turn the election for Kamala Harris.
"Um I can't say being because I'm pretty much t know exactly where you st better way or a smoother you know where you stand one of these, he's gonna and do something else ove have anything else to add is might be on the fence vote for?"
Nice and loud.
I spend more time thinking about the difference between traditional and tomato and basil marinara sauce.
Yesterday went on Fox News.
"Now, is it possible there could be a polling miss in favor of Harris, I guess."
"And that home ownership is one of the surest ways to build intergenerational wealth, right?"
"And this is a county that even JD Vance won despite, you know, underperforming statewide."
"So it is a little bit outdated, but still the month of July had the assassination attempt that had Biden stepping aside and back in Harris."
1.
So I'm excited to pull it back out.
"No, I'm a Marine."
I'm giving it back to the states for people to vote on it.
"Andrew, Ryan, both of you know who you're voting for, but a lot of your fellow students are still undecided."
What do you think of Reading?
"When I lived in Maryland, I was a registered Republican."
You're seeing questions about support among black men and Latinos.
"Like, Amish Trump parades in Pennsylvania with horse and buggy and Trump flag."
It was also friends and coworkers and neighbors.
"And before we get into this interesting poll, it's important to cover the fact that the mail in Pennsylvania keeps getting redder every single day."
But now the surveys seem to indicate that Kamala Harris is now pulling ahead of Donald Trump.
I know I'm doing my level best to speak to every Latino voter.
I love JD.
"If you like it or not, he's the energy you had with Barack."
"Democrats went down by roughly 300,000 votes."
"Go out and make a plan to vote early, vote absentee, or vote in person on election day, but you gotta get out and vote."
But when she did you know she cribbed Trump's idea for no tax on tips.
You want to win the champion.
"The Independent, Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, showcased a Tesla Cybertruck equipped with a machine gun, expressing gratitude to Elon Musk for the vehicle."
And apparently the internals have Trump up by around two to five points in Pennsylvania as of now.
I think we really have to get control of the media.
The legal victory in Pennsylvania could have broader implications beyond the state itself.
So until next time.
"And he already did that in 2020 he lost 60 court cases, but it didn't seem to matter and everybody in the last resort was to have this This insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th but my fear is that November could be just as This would be the nice word for just as raucous as it was in 2020, right?"
But I think it's a good thing that we're going back to the presidential election.
"Pennsylvania is the second largest natural gas producer in the country, and Trump has attacked Harris relentlessly for her previous support of a fracking ban."
"In his speech, Trump accused Democrats of using Euquevah to commit voter fraud and disenfranchise military votes."
"You know, I love our democracy."
"So I think that the Democrats are in a good position to win the state of Pennsylvania, reestablishing the blue wall."
We have the Donald Trump mugshot design.
Her contribution is aimed at supporting Harris' efforts to improve healthcare outcomes and make cutting-edge treatments more affordable and accessible.
"JD Vance and Donald Trump, on the other hand, really aren't."
"Oh, my God."
"That is, Roy Cooper."
Y'all I'm not these regular niggas Power I'm different blood.
"Has, you know, tied herself to those concrete things."
And it's certainly distinct and different from Donald Trump.
Thanks for joining us for this Fox 29 You Decide election special.
"So Libby, we were just showing some video from a campaign event yesterday that the president was talking about."
"Now, it's still unclear if the governor will return home tonight."
It's pretty interesting to me.
"We have to assume that because we know with Pennsylvania polling in October, there can be huge misses."
And I think a lot of that did come from the fact that she did get that Trump endorsement.
"Well, jolt of energy is the right phrase."
"Kamala Harris not only tweeting about it, but she played one of these gaff reels at a rally in Pennsylvania."
I mean there are a lot of women out there who are who are you know put off by Trump's personality or are concerned about abortion.
Fracking is a big industry in a number of states.
That's what people know.
"For a couple, it is about 42,000 to 127,000 for a family of three, 60,000 to 180,000 for four, 67."
"Because even if Trump were to win North Carolina and Georgia and Arizona, three states he's currently leading in the polls right now, if Harris wins Wisconsin and Michigan and Nevada, three states she's leading in right now, she would win the presidency."
So wouldn't that mean Biden is more over?
"But this marked an overperformance for Democrats by a little over 11 points, as Joshua Smithley points out, in a Trump plus 28 district, probably a bit be about 10 ish in the end."
"He currently leads in enough states right now to get to 270 electoral votes, which is absolutely huge."
"I mean, there's some differences here, but this is going to be an extremely close race."
"You know, I've been proud to be endorsed by firefighter unions in my campaigns."
He's fighting for you.
It's for women.
And it turned out she was available and wanted to do it.
"You're already seeing Republicans, you know, resurface those concerns after Governor Walz was announced, as Vice President Harris was running mate last night."
"Reporting from Atlanta Georgia, Iris Tao and Hyli News."
"Now, she is from California."
"Thank you, Meghan."
"So if the if the voter base turns out well, you know, I think it's going to be something that's going to give Donald Trump a boost."
Pennsylvania or Philadelphia itself has got its own like constituencies.
Son.
"So your reaction, Nancy Cook, you have a kind of an expertise built out over a career in the economic sphere and politics."
Democrats have gone down every day.
"The leadership refused to endorse Kamala Harris, which is a stunning defeat for her, by the way."
"But now it's, it's a harder call just because I am not a fan of Donald Trump."
"At the same time, again, I'm quoting from Trump here, the Democrats are radical."
"Yeah, you know, it's hard to say."
And that's the very first political Amish buggy parade ever in history.
Our elections last forever.
So Donald Trump is a two-point lead in the states that actually matter.
It's hard to take the abstract and make it real.
Why is that important to you?
Where's the you know where people just repeating what happened and putting it on on?
"Everything that I've seen outside of like a Republican internal last night, everything I've seen is very, very good."
You and I both know what I'm talking about.
So I think it's the kind of the cumulative weight of all of these factors and whether or not people feel like we're heading on the right track.
They think it's OK.
We appreciate you.
And let's take a step back and talk about Pennsylvania as a whole.
The RNC was gutted.
"We all know that about two, three months ago, there was an attempt on Donald Trump's life."
You still have some competitive races going on here.
"There are men across the ideological spectrum, but probably in many more rights, who will not vote for women."
"Fight, fight, fight."
So this little bitch is crying that he didn't get selected for VP and not campaigning with the rest of the Democrats.
You look at union and non-union blue collar men in particular white non-college educated men that's a group that decided this for Trump in Pennsylvania as well as those other blue wall states.
"Yeah, no, this is madness."
"Saying he's too dumb to ask follow-up questions, but not smart enough to make her look bad if he doesn't want those allegations against them to come back."
"So, Mr. Tough Guy on China, except when he can make a few bucks, hawking his Trump edition Bibles."
Another really important thing that's been happening recently is the uptick in the early vote of black women and women in general.
All of a sudden he says he's a Republican.
Trumpy Trout is the greatest fish I've ever caught.
in this presidential race.
And he spoke to those who may still be undecided.
"And what there's no evidence that that one attack or that one, even a conviction is going to be the thing that breaks the camel's back."
All the better.
"Um, I gotta say I agree and I concur I think with what we saw happen Did the aftermath just everything?"
What the hell how could they talking about?
We don't know if he's been shot.
And the next number six Trump will lower grocery prices and also fuel prices this is amazing for everyone who is living in United States as a legal residence.
And then he talks about the lowest unemployment rate.
 We begin tonight with the race for president just 22 days until the election.
"Just like or like Trump, people have a pretty good sense of those."
Secret Service is dealing with everything on the inside.
"Ryan, what do you think they need to hear on Tuesday, that undecided voter?"
They didn't.
Evidence.
"So it doesn't escalate any further, but it is crazy."
"And if he's elected president, I believe that he'll make policy change."
If my numbers were off.
"And I'll tell you, every Tuesday, you will see us at Roots Country Market in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the major hub of the Amish."
"Five point five average error, five point five partisan bias in favor of the Republicans."
"Chip, let's start with you."
"Now, do not boo."
Let me hear that music please.
They what do they say is Atlas?
I know you're always on the Hill as well so you're probably thinking about these questions too.
"Separate from that, he also issued a separate ruling requiring that local officials and jurisdictions certify their election results on time."
Democrats fret that any mistake here could tip the election.
She's a criminal.
She's yet to do a press conference.
"It's a pro-Trump, pro-Constitution petition."
He only had 20 minutes.
"First of all, can you clear up for us?"
Arizona really seems to be trending.
There's a coordinated attack.
And he's campaigning in states.
"Well, you can't afford to lose any more states."
"I'm just going to make the product you've made even better, so I just want to take a look at Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, and what we see is a tightening race in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
I think it was Virgo.
"Who are people of color who are sold on their message, you know, just do your own research Try not to be so biased try not to trust and everything that you hear on TV do your own research And once you start doing your own research and going down that rabbit hole You can make an honest opinion based off of that, you know And I feel like everybody deserves a fair chance, but Trump definitely has my attention when it comes to certain things that he talks about and I just like how direct he is and how you know, you know not so He doesn't just bow down to the media and I like that if Kamala Harris were to be elected She'd be the first black female president."
"That's a parody but with the way twitter is now you see they got the check mark as well He said at least you spoke before biden but real talk man, um, you know anything we're talking about not just the poly not just politics Just different stuff in the news again."
They're these guys.
Former President Barack Obama will be on stage here in western Pennsylvania in a fieldhouse at the University of Pittsburgh in just over an hour.
"For Harris to achieve a victorious outcome, she must inspire and galvanize high voter turnout in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburban areas, where a significant concentration of educated voters, particularly women and minorities, resides."
Do black men have more concerns than other men with their crypto?
So we need to close that gap and we need to get everybody out and voting register.
"US, former LA Daily News editor Ron Kay has passed away at the age of 83, leaving behind a legacy of fierce journalism and community advocacy."
Let's play it and get your reaction.
Maybe it's wrong.
And you could have made sort of a pretty similar video.
"During and after the debate, Donald Trump seemed to be on the defense."
"They've already got basically a seat in the bag in West Virginia with Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat retiring there."
"Yeah, yeah."
"And last time Trump had a rally in Atlanta, I will say he told this huge crowd of supporters that Trump, that Kemp, excuse me, is disloyal."
The campaigns themselves basically have a different strategy.
"Yeah, I mean, so definitely it's shifted around."
They've moved back behind us and some of them in the direction of their cars or towards all the the walking areas that got them.
That's why you see her taking the time to come to Bucks County.
"So in some of these states you actually need not just a certain amount of signatures, but I guess you need some number of electors to guarantee to pledge their vote for you."
"And he goes, yeah, I love him."
"Okay, the point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired."
"And yet Sherrod Brown in their own internal polling seems to be pulling ahead of their Republican candidate, Bernie Moreno."
"Your state is always in the crosshairs, every presidential election that I can remember."
"So for Trump to be up here, yeah, it's a big freaking deal."
"When we talk about bringing down prices and making life more affordable for people, what are one or two specific things you have in mind for that?"
"I mean you combine this concert yesterday with he's campaigning in California, he's campaigning in New York."
Get comfortable with uncertainty.
We've got to win the election.
" In the basement of this unassuming building in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, you'll find what's known as the underground."
What's coming and they cannot stop it.
"Fast forward after 2020 and Trump's false or false claims about the election, you've started to see Republicans kind of backtrack on that."
This is a big crowd.
"It's your boy, man, Small County J in the building."
"Oh, I did it."
He has and he will.
"Now, our playlist would probably be better, but..."
"They're basically even on this question now, but that was not the case when we polled this race a month ago."
"Zach, the Harris campaign is unveiling a new agenda aimed at attracting black male voters."
He then lies about crowd sizes in speeches that he gave many months ago.
All of them are blue.
"What you said was, in these circumstances of a lack of democracy, people will turn to violence."
"Because, you know, you keep the popular vote within two points, you're probably going to win."
"In the third poll, conducted by Redfield and Wilton Strategies, from August 12 to 15, with 825 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 44%."
And then it clearly makes him the person still to beat in this Senate primary.
"The poll indicates a competitive race, with both candidates having strong bases of support."
"However, he also has some baggage with him."
"Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris is laser focused on key issues like climate change, economic reform, and women's rights."
"But at the same time, this isn't just a movement that's built around economic nationalism."
"But so basically, 75% of the poll is whites, and that's concerning right there."
"Sometimes you wonder, wow, is all this necessary?"
Pennsylvania is the most likely candidate.
I like Charlie XCX.
"Uh, what a what a crazy Thought that is though."
I think that resonates with folks.
"She's in Erie, Pennsylvania tonight."
"And in this next clip, Trump did a private fundraiser today and he was asking about crypto."
"This makes for an especially tense election atmosphere, as both parties are pulling out all the stops to mobilize their voter bases."
It's been a consistent move up.
What will you be watching for as things get underway here?
Inspirations is all the movies.
It made it something that we could regulate as a medical procedure.
But then came Quinnipiac University.
"Kelly Carty is an attorney, a registered Republican."
We'll play YMCA and we'll go home.
"Rubin's support reflects a growing trend of sports figures engaging in political advocacy, using their platforms to influence public opinion and drive change."
"He has become hyper focused on Pennsylvania, telling Pennsylvania's at the Butler rally that Harrison Walls will take away."
"Associated Press, the Harris-Walls campaign has reserved $370 million in advertising from Labor Day to Election Day, with $170 million allocated for television ads in battleground states and over $200 million for digital platforms like Hulu, Roku, and YouTube."
"To me, the state seems to have shifted quite a bit in that time."
Any kind of energy you see is false.
So let me go to our telestrator here because we have a map of that location.
She wants to limit all immigration.
"And then to wrap up the states, up in New Hampshire, it does tend to be the most competitive state here in the Northeast, excluding Pennsylvania of course, though it has now voted blue in seven of the last eight cycles."
And that's what the Democratic Party is fighting for.
"Amanda, you didn't raise your hand."
You only need one more.
Was there anything else you wanted to mention?
"When the decision was made to overturn Roe, his reaction was that that decision made him, quote, very, very happy, unquote."
So it says basically we got these counties said decided already.
"When they heard Eric and Don Jr. were like, Suckers."
"A new Alien film for sci-fi fans, a family adventure and an action comedy."
"When you hear it, what you hear is he's talking to Pennsylvania voters saying that they don't like Trump style, but they're going to vote for him anyway."
"And then 18 to 34 year olds, Trump had a two-point edge."
"If you warn your own MAGA audience, then you're not doing it right."
Let's pause right here.
We'll have the audio up as well.
"It is a small margin at the moment, 478,000 total, but the difference there is about 277."
"But if you're the Harris campaign, knowing that Biden was supposed to win Pennsylvania by six points at the same time back in 2020, you want to be up by four to five points at the bare minimum, not tied."
"However, a lot of them don't want to vote Kamala either."
So it is top of mind for me.
"I think nuclear politics, as we've seen, based on social media, based on who runs it, is that they do very much have partisan beliefs."
So it's like a giant multidimensional puzzle where the pieces keep changing shape.
I just took a picture with that handsome guy.
"Many attendees on Wednesday were also present at the Butler rally, others felt compelled to attend due to the tragic day."
No.
And we can see Pennsylvania can go Republican as it did back in 2016.
And so some of them called on him to drop out.
"Oh, but you have the Buffalo Soldiers just to represent?"
But we really haven't seen much of him on the campaign trail since.
It was all Roe versus Wade for their paid advertising.
"For the other three, the decision ultimately comes down to character in protecting the Constitution."
They keep calling people a tinks and lying about reparations and then trying to argue why it's appropriate to mutilate your children.
So there was a lot of drama around that.
And we see them showing up and voting that way.
I see a lot of delicious snacks behind you.
I think it was stolen.
It extended historic protections and support to survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault for the first time.
"Yeah, we had cases."
"So he drops out of the race, says he's going to support Donald Trump, but now he finds out his name will still be on the ballot."
And what I'm trying to do is use a platform that I have and urging the vice president to chart a new course on what's happening.
"These 15 Pennsylvania billionaires have made significant contributions to Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign, collectively donating tens of millions of dollars."
"Some of these millennial voters might move right as they, you know, age."
This is just a perfect example.
"Let's see, can we zoom in only on the comments?"
People understand it's bullsh- It's bullsh- Wind is bullsh- I think it's all bullsh- I got indicted more than him on bullsh- Dude.
"Now they're out here slugging it out, spending millions upon millions of dollars in what should be a sure bet for them."
"By the way, the Democratic party has also pushed numerous lawsuits to keep candidates like Jill Stein, candidates like Cornel West, off the ballot in swing states."
"In fact, a lot of people were conflating this for firecrackers that didn't go down until they saw the former president get rushed by his security detail."
"And to some involved in the efforts, it's happening at the encouragement of former President Donald Trump."
And number three Trump will be banning men competing in women's sports it at whatever cost it takes he will ban that absolutely 100%.
"Traveling with him recently, Laura Loomer, a conspiracy theorist who last year insisted 9-11 was an inside job."
"There Donald Trump just has a six point lead, which is no lead really."
"You're watching Harris is outreach specifically to Latino voters with what is really the strategy here and why is that voter base so crucial, especially this time around?"
Some of them are remaining true.
But the fear tactic is not going to work.
This is comparing Democrat Republican requests and how much the Democrats have dropped in 2024 versus the Republicans.
"Yeah, I mean, fuck."
Are you going to work to help Kamala Harris be elected?
This video can watch in a playlist of my 2024 presidential election analysis videos.
And he did a fist pump to let the people know that he was going to be okay.
"But she is now giving us a laundry list of things that she'll do in order to support black men in America, including money for new homeowners."
It's becoming a more Republican state.
And a brand new formula that drives those dollars out to the districts that need it most.
You see what happened yesterday?
I had friends who disagreed with me on every issue.
"But my broader point is that today, he made a post saying that we are interfering with the election, we as in Democrats, and that there is foreign interference."
And this is what it takes.
Successfully appealing to a broad coalition will be vital for her electoral strategy.
And there were real consequences to this.
The president has been struck.
"Labor leadership may be, but that event had people that were invite only from, you know, the labor unions, most of them, there are a lot of them who are labor leaders, there were some rank and file there."
President Biden won this state just by 50% of the vote.
You could say that some of these polls here have registered these two polls that showed Kamala Harris out of the margin of error for her victory.
"Dana and I were just talking about, I want to get your take on this."
You can vote early or return your mail ballot today.
So what this is possibly saying is we're seeing Kamala Harris polls getting more skewed up.
 Pennsylvania is the most pivotal battleground in the race for the White House.
It was a pandemic.
What is his lasting legacy?
This rollout went about as well as any campaign could have hoped for.
Have you guys supported him in the past or you guys our first time first time supporting him What brought you guys around this time?
We can see that it's clearly dead heat.
"If Harris is doing a point worse than Biden in Pennsylvania, Trump's got it."
I'm super proud to cast my first ever ballot for President Trump.
"It's kind of rough, but he gets results."
"The states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio will be central to determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election."
Other people have their own opinions on it.
But I just think the further and further we get away from COVID.
"And the trend, of course, she at one point was ahead in a majority of those states, again, but within the margin of error."
"But you know, a poll like Trafalgar, which had one really bad cycle in 2022, they apparently need to be kicked to the curb."
"What I would say about the economy is it affects me personally, but it also affects every age group and every demographic of people in this country."
"And veterans furthermore do not take kindly to the Biden-Kamala Harris debacle of pulling out of Afghanistan, which caused 13 Gold Star families."
"I just, I did not succeed in a scrapple eating contest, but it's pork products and some filler, but you can do it, fry it up on a grill."
And support Donald Trump.
But it was interesting over the weekend.
"Commonly referred to as the Divine Nine, the Collaborative boasts more than 2.5 million active members nationwide."
Royer.
She said Kamala has one big advantage.
"And that's why I'm out here doing the work that I'm doing about talking with folks, listening with folks, because I'm running for President of the United States."
So he has a long history with the Commonwealth.
You have certainly heard people who do not like Donald Trump.
We meet the Amish where they are.
"I would like to hear more from her speaking about tax policy, and I'd like to hear more of how she's actually willing to compromise with Congress to give these policies passed that we desperately need, whether it's on immigration, whether it's on tax policy, whether it's cutting spending, whether it's giving more power and energy to the Ukrainians so that they can rally into Russia."
So you kind of have to do both things.
"For starters, you have the New York Times with their horrendous poll."
"Well, they definitely exist."
"They're in the eastern third of the state, the Delaware River Valley."
"Now where we are here in downtown Erie, this area is generally democratic, and we went out to a diner in Waterford about 20 minutes from here, and that was a bit more Republican, a bit more Republican area, more Trump supporters out there."
He leads across the board.
There's actually still a bit of undecidedness among leading Republicans.
This is lying.
I agree with Angie.
"How you doing, Bob?"
" Okay, and same so same question to you now."
The Keystone state will continue to be in the spotlight until November.
I think you will see him gain a little bit.
"There's no common sense We need a change of leadership simple simple Voters know man and right now Trump is skyrocketing in Millions and millions of people say Trump won the debate on the side of voters say Trump won the debate We believe Trump wanted to debate and I wish that uh, they would he he want to took so much of their bait as It was a three verse one But he still came out on top man Which is the economy before the debate Donald Trump 53 after the debate 55 Kamala Harris before 37 after after 35 so virtually no movement on that and if anything, I know it's margin of error But it went down a little bit Again cuz she couldn't answer she couldn't answer she dodged She dodged the questions What did you expect after dodging the equal the questions, what did you expect?"
" Donald Trump is back here in Butler, Pennsylvania for some unfinished business as his campaign has put it."
Let me know what you think.
But she's a communist.
And the article specifically mentions her.
"You dumb racist white people, white Republicans, there's nothing going on."
"So it's not a surprise that they're voting in big numbers right now in Pennsylvania and other States, but really just kind of have to look at the polls and we can't predict for sure what the polls are gonna look like three weeks from now."
"And for lack of better words, it kind of went off the rails."
They tried to kidnap her Okay She's a good-looking woman None of us are gonna mind looking at her for eight years at all.
"Oh, yeah, I mean, yeah, it was it was a surprise."
So this place holds a lot of significance as far as the US election is concerned.
Such an important reminder.
I just want to be in the irony of there being a gas station behind it.
But then ABC Ipsos has Harris plus four.
"I remember looking up a year or so ago, I don't know the exact number, but I feel like federal lands, there's only about 10% is owned in terms of the federal lands, the federal leases."
And now I've heard Amish for Trump.
"The latest survey from TIPP Insights with American Greatness, a Trump-aligned pack, is Harris leading Trump by 2 points here, with 48.4% to 46%, so more like 2.4% to be exact, in this sample of 741 likely voters surveyed between August 20th and 22nd."
"I can't remember the exact word they used, but it lasted a little too long."
"Yeah, and Brandon, Pennsylvania, as we know, is a very big state."
What was it outside of Nevada in 2016?
"And they're very, very happy."
"The survey, executed by Fabrizio Lee and associates NGBAL and sponsored by the Wall Street Journal, involves 600 registered voters from the state."
"Not just because of one pollster having Harris plus four because if you're up by only one, hell, you're not even up by a point, you're still tied."
This is an outlier.
"But before he could appear in Tucson a second time, his campaign had to make a deposit of $145,000 up front."
I go to the grocery store and I take whatever items I want and I can afford them.
"The real clear politics aggregate for Pennsylvania is exactly tied right now, even with Bloomberg Morning Consult throwing in a Harris plus five that's way out in left field."
"And right now, housing is unaffordable, and the everyday costs are really high."
"Cafe Versailles in Little Havana, as you know, it is a stopping ground for every presidential candidate and really shapes the narrative on that issue as well."
And so this is the kind of message that she's taking to these redder areas where Donald Trump may have won to help grow her support and hopefully put her over the edge in these battleground states.
We just don't know but Pennsylvania is a crucial state for Donald Trump and he never led in Pennsylvania back in 2020.
"This is about as significant because ever since the debate, President Biden has sharply declining in Pennsylvania and Donald Trump has been inclining."
"But hey, when you're on Jimmy Fallon's show, why not go big right?"
I did.
"As Trump took the stage, it became clear that this would not be a rally about policy, or even his 2024 campaign."
"But in the last several months since the Israel-Gaza war has broken out, a lot of these voters are starting to turn away from the left because of some liberal lawmakers pro-Palestinian stance."
"And this is despite the Republican frequently calling Latino countries a shithole, while terming Hispanic migrants as criminals and rapists."
Obviously it's a coin toss.
It's not a hypothetical.
"We've got what, 42 or 43 more days to go."
That would be the equivalent.
"So if he's able to close that gap, which isn't a given, this could end up being just as close of a race in the Senate as it is for president."
"Today is Wednesday, August 7th, 2024, and today we are gonna be talking specifically about the state of Pennsylvania and two new batches of polls that show Kamala Harris in the advantage, according to a Democratic pollster, and tied, according to a Republican pollster, in a massive, massive shift relative to where President Biden was standing against President Trump in this election, in this battleground state."
And I get like being newer to politics and hearing people talk about certain things and not knowing what it means.
"And for me, running for Dearborn, for mayor of Dearborn, was about the opportunity to improve the quality of life for all of our residents."
"I mean, you guys can update me if you want."
"Come on, people."
You can read Mabinti and the rest of our political teams coverage at WashingtonExaminer.com.
But what is not binary is either are the positions that are being taken right now overseas.
Others were examined for possible smoke inhalation.
And I think that also makes a lot of sense.
You can listen to people say it was a triumph.
"So, over there, I was dead shirt."
Where's Kelly at?
We want to be tough on immigration.
"So given that, the society is also divided right from the middle."
What's that go?
"He leads with enthusiastic voters, not so enthusiastic voters, and he leads, period."
It supposedly is looking phenomenal for Republicans.
"The one thing that voters here in Pennsylvania respect is when you show up, you look them in the eye, you tell them the truth and you listen."
And Hamoud tells Michel Martin about the growing voter disaffection in his community and what it would take to restore their trust in the upcoming presidential election.
You can't really get rid of the farmer.
Trump loves America.
"As you may recall, Donald Trump won all the electoral votes in Pennsylvania in the 2016 US presidential election by a margin of 0.72%."
"Right now, he's slated to be the victor in Georgia."
"What are they most concerned about, especially if they have not decided who they're voting for?"
"Probably the rule of law, like Dan said, someone who's going to follow our constitutional process, someone who's going to honor that."
Their average member is in their early 30s.
She was leading in Pennsylvania.
"Many of these voters, particularly in the eastern part of the state, were once part of the Democratic coalition but have shifted to the Republicans in response to Trump's populist economic message."
Messaging plays a crucial role in shaping voter perceptions and engagement.

"According to New York Times report, the campaign now has a legal team of hundreds of staff attorneys and thousands of volunteer attorneys to combat expected challenges from Republicans this election cycle, including possibly the results of the 2024 election."
And you think about what the vice president's doing today.
Who is it?
He was very nice.
"For this reason, the candidate with the most votes in Pennsylvania on election night will take an important step towards the presidency."
She's gonna win in a landslide.
"Truthfully, whatever they're smoking, I'd like to have some of it."
He's a great speaker too.

I'm a data guy.
"In Scranton, Taylor Proppolar's Spectrum News."

And our ABC News Ipsos polling shows a big 17 point gender gap with Trump leading among men with eight points and Harris leading among women with nine points.
Three candidate strategies.
"Because while yes, Harris, if she loses Pennsylvania, it becomes very difficult for her to win."
So that's just where my focus continues to be.
"And so the 0.5% advantage here, while not certainly as impressive as Biden's plus six points in 2020, Hillary Clinton's even seven point advantage after the convention, we are finding that Kamala Harris is rebounding, especially relative to Biden, who again, when he dropped out, was down three points nationally."
"Well, it needs to be about the issues."
So we'll see how that gets resolved in the next coming eight days.
He's listening to it.
It's the economy.

"Today, they're making stops in Michigan and Wisconsin."
"In 2012, it was a single-digit state in 2016."
The series of explosive noises shuttered through this crowd.

 And we also have new polling out of Arizona.
"I can't imagine the American people are dumb enough to vote for Kamala Harris, by and large, number one."
So I'm here helping engage the Amish with Dr. Oz and master Reno.

He injects his character with quiet moments of joy and redemption.
"The latest poll released in Pennsylvania by Insider Advantage has Trump up over Harris by less than a full percentage point, 46.6% to 46% flat."
"Scott, this comes as all eyes were really on this rally because we are just days before the Republican National Convention and at any moment the president, the former president was expected to announce his VP pick."

So he's already about to crack 50%.
"I'm curious, so both were recently in Pennsylvania."
"And usually it's like white men saying that like so, I don't know."

"Okay, I've talked myself back into it."
And I think the messaging was very interesting in terms of Kamala Harris.
Move.
Having a childcare tax credit.

Key swing state for both parties.

And what sounds like he's saying he's going to vote for Trump.
"So what are you seeing, thinking and feeling about the Republicans' ground game?"
The president?
I think that's pretty fair to say different lies.
Our polling has it pretty much even here.
That's called wealth creation.
I think you're going to see probably Atlas Intel drop another poll and Trafalgar and they're all going to show broadly the same kind of thing as me.
"Yeah, it's become much more of a swing state than it used to be in part because the divide between the Blue Philadelphia and the red rural areas Has become much more pronounced number one and the second thing is that the suburban counties around?"
It was close when you poll in each one of those states.
But all of this is super scary.

"They maybe haven't seen a campaign like this because of covid, because of the things that's happening."
"Why do you think both campaigns, they're kind of ignoring Wisconsin, Nevada, but they're throwing everything at Pennsylvania, Georgia, kind of Arizona, but they're targeting Pennsylvania, Georgia the most because if you win just one of these two states of your Trump, your pathway to winning the presidency is all but secured."
The good news is that Trump has managed to convince more Republicans to do this.

"That's just another try, you know, little loophole thing to try and make it so, oh, they can come at the mail-in ballots can come at any time."
What have you been seeing in your area in Pennsylvania just in the last couple of years?
It's sort of like a microcosm of all of America.
The reality is that there are certain things that must be repeated to ensure that I have everyone know what I stand for and the issues that I think are at stake in this election.

"And we're seeing it today as Harris campaigns across the blue wall state, specifically targeting these independent and more moderate Republicans who may not necessarily be sold on the idea of Trump just yet."
"With the singer endorsing Kamala Harris, do these high profile endorsements even matter that much?"
"They probably can't afford it, sir."

"Now, I think he could very well be up by a little bit more and it doesn't take into account potential swings in places like Philadelphia City proper, where it's the largest county in the state."
"But kind of like Georgia and North Carolina, Harris' appeal as a candidate is most strongly suited to Virginia's demographic profile."
"And I'm not big on predictions, but I will say this."
I used to cover the Philly suburbs.
"Now, there is some more credence to the idea that he's the pick because Kamala is launching a battleground state tour in the coming week."
Are we getting out our voter base?

How did he even get in there with a weapon?
Another poll shows the Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are neck and neck in Pennsylvania.
Vice President Kamala Harris is on the verge of announcing her running mate.
And it seems like most of those are coming home to Trump according to the latest poll.
"And that here, you can sense that as well."
"OK, legitimately massive."
It is Pennsylvania.
"I think she's doing really well and she seems to have a lot of momentum and I donated to the campaign and it sounds like she's doing really good with her fundraising, so yeah things look good."

"But nuclear politics, I'm only using as a point of reference because their website is really strong in comparison to some others, and also tells us a lot about where Biden was and where Harris is now, just as a point of reference, as a point of comparison, but I will say, I do not believe Kamala Harris is up by one point, sorry, Donald Trump is up by 1.8% in Pennsylvania right now, because what we have seen is a massive, massive reduction in terms of support from the past for Trump compared to when he was running against Biden."

"The fact that Shapiro brought up the issue of family values, which is a topic that has traditionally been associated with the Republican Party, was a turn of events that was completely unexpected."
"People were waiting, including after the debate, thinking, well, at the debate, we'll get some specifics."

Pennsylvania has a very important influence in determining the next president of the United States.
"It is true that they're tied in the state right now, but that means that Donald Trump is actually winning because he typically underperforms in public opinion polls and does better on election day."

Is there a state you view as the most important?

That's why Pennsylvania is so crucial.
It's everything.
We'll leave it at that.
So I think he needs to be replaced.
" Plation she wouldn't do that over again either Maybe the worst of all and something that a lot of people don't hear about because look at all the papers This was Donald Trump's worst nightmare You see the empty seats there at this auditorium where he gave a speech this evening in Reading, Pennsylvania In addition to the empty seats in this auditorium people were leaving in the middle of Donald Trump's speech as well Let's show you when people were walking out on him something that makes him incredibly embarrassed play this clip How about the natural Gas export ban that is crushing, Pennsylvania right now Most of you don't even know about that in and all but and she will but if she ever won this thing You wouldn't be fracking for 24 hours But how about that and it's crushing, Pennsylvania hurting you it's going on We've got some photos as well of the empty auditorium here You can see the empty seats there in the back Donald Trump then claimed that That there's never people who leave and that this was a packed crowd."

"What about for President Biden, Matt?"
"You're in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state."
That's when members of Congress meet to certify the electoral votes from the 2024 presidential election.
Most people don't realize that they seem to think that there was a bigger margin for Biden in 2020 than there was for Clinton in Philadelphia.

"Yeah, I also think I think economy."
"In the fourth poll, also conducted by Fabrizio Ward, on the exact same dates with a different 400 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 47%."
"Um, what if their life was better do they want to own a ho they want to buy groceries family that serve this co want them to vote?"
That's a big one.
These key democratic vote banks are appearing to gravitate towards Trump.
They are seventh from the bottom.
So all those numbers fall on him to where the jobs don't get added back while he's in office and they can manipulate numbers like this.
"So they kind of have excess cash, where Trump is really pouring his money into Pennsylvania right now, whichever the battleground states is worth the most electoral votes."
It's not just the polling that's very bad for Dems.
"He certainly has endless resources, but understand Kamala Harris is a very important person."
"And while I certainly do not believe it will be enough for an electoral college landslide, it will be enough for an electoral college victory if this momentum maintains itself."
"In his analysis of the next election in 2024, Shapiro described it not only as a contest between two political parties, but more as a referendum on the continuation of democratic values."
And so that's why team Biden is trying to make a pitch to those voters.
Catherine do you have any thoughts on it?
Libertarian candidate.
The big question right now for Harris is will Shapiro help her clinch the Keystone state come November?
He wants them to win this election so badly.

What would a trump Vance administration look like on day one and he basically says that America needs common sense policies economic policies and that they are running this race to make things more affordable for people who can't afford groceries and who can't afford homes who just can't afford.

"Lots of attacks, not much yet on the issues."
"But anyway, I thought to myself, I wonder if she ever told come on, uh, Willie Brown to say it to her face and do that."

Part of that is what people choose to accept.
"If I were Trump, frankly, I would not try for Pennsylvania, but but does this no point to it."

They had a huge lead and it's been cut in half or I think even more than half because 800 K now it's like three 50.
We don't want to see women in tragic situations where they're still carrying a baby that's no longer even viable and being forced to carry that baby until natural labor occurs because women have died that way.
I am making it to talk niggas just to get president just get shot they used to die what's going on bar we lose a recipe.
And let's look at other pollsters.
"That's why they're running this misinformation campaign now against Jill Stein, or a vote for Jill Stein, there's a vote for Trump, a vote for Cornel West, there's a vote for Trump."
"And so she can try to say, well, we didn't try to ban it during the Biden administration."

"Yeah, he helped me through events."
"The rally highlighted the political tension as Democrats prepared for their national convention, with Harris as their nominee, hoping to capitalize on her appeal to younger, liberal voters."

So the one place you could probably expect him to be again and again is in Pennsylvania.
This was the first time we really had heard from Musk in public on behalf of Trump.
There's a lot going on there.
"On the one hand, he said that Trump's populist appeal from 2016 has significantly decreased, while on the other hand, he credited Harris's success to her ability to resonate with a diverse variety of individuals, including moderate Republicans and independents."
But they're showing Trump's in a strong position as well.
"They're all coming here, even Christine Todd Whitman from across the Delaware River right behind me, the former New Jersey governor, sent just Republicans."
I'm still kind of in a shock.
"Long time, long time."

And we're going to be seeing it through different campaign efforts and as well as today in Pennsylvania.
When did that become okay?
"And you can see still from my vantage point on the other side of this camera, people in tears, people hugging each other, people comforting each other."
They've got to do something because black men are not in love with Kamala even though Obama came out and said she's basically your Kamala.
I want to be able to see him.
"And so when you're living this lie, when you're like acting out a part, and by the way, you're not a very good actor, you're going to have fails like what he had at the donut shop."
Trump doesn't have a message.
Never heard it.
Does that mean it's going to trend fifteen points Republican?

Maybe is a better way to say that by the Democratic base this week.
"Oh, Latino and black Democratic leaders met with Harris, officials behind closed doors in separate meetings in Philadelphia late last month, said five people who attended or who were briefed on it."

No Democrats we spoke to here in battleground Pennsylvania.
"You've got polls that show some 34% of Americans, nearly 70% of Republicans who still to this day believe that Joe Biden didn't win the 2020 election."

"Okay, look, an NBC national news poll put Kamala Harris's favorability jumping 16 points since July."
"So I mean, and she does the exact same thing in this and making life more affordable for people."
"And so, sure, if you're winning in North Hampton and Erie County, you're probably doing pretty well."
"So don't say I'm not voting for Republican, but I'm not that behind VP Harris."
"I like Reading, my mom used to live in PA, so I like PA, it's a good state."
And you could probably tell why it's Harris plus one.
"It may not be by 30 points, but I would argue that Trump is right now the favorite in the Commonwealth."
What are one or two specific things you have budget Chris Cuomo?
"About 55% say legal, 40% say illegal."

Let's take a look at it once again on our decision desk HQ forecast map.
And I appreciate y'all coming out the day before homecoming.
We remember them.
You've got to be talking to us.
"Yeah, no, this is nice."
"Sir, I think it's their calling and asking to stop He then addresses Donald Trump giving Covid tests to Vladimir Putin instead of Americans during Covid it's play May God bless you all and may God protect those serving in the eye of this storm on behalf of our nation."
Pennsylvania knew Joe Biden and they knew the old Joe Biden and they were comfortable with the older Joe Biden.
And that's the biggest problem for Harris.
"While Harris's platform addresses the need for comprehensive immigration reform and public health initiatives.as the election approaches, both campaigns will need to tailor their strategies to appeal to Arizona's diverse electorate."
I'm just trying to make the point that there are a whole lot of folks on the side of Harrison walls who have the ability to go out and bring different people into the conversation and be out there stumping for her when she's not able to be there.
So Kamala is trying to take his place.
The third poll was conducted between September 14th and 15 by Insider Advantage among 800 likely voters.
"And so whether you harken back to the Donald Trump future, because he would say that's what he's delivering in the future or to a different vision of the future from Kamala Harris, I think both these candidates will need to tie that into their message this evening."
"A couple of weeks ago, his running mate had the nerve, the hook spot, to say that Donald Trump salvaged the Affordable Care Act."
"John Ribel, you're doing a live video after the VP debate."
"So they decided to stand down and stand by, so to speak."
"And so Kamala went on to Charlemagne the Gods podcast, Breakfast Club Power Hour, 105.1 FM."
We are three months away from election day and tonight the race for the White House is red.
He observes Shabbat.
"Now they're pushing this misinformation campaign that Jill Stein is a Trump agent, and Jill Stein is only running the hurt camel."

He's just bringing up her past statements.
They target young black men.
"The quote is, Pennsylvania is such a mess."
But the Harris campaign cannot get overconfident.
So I'm looking forward to November.
"You guys know the people who have Donald Trump, everything very hard."
"We're businessmen at the same time, though."
The only reason he didn't get a lot more done is because they gave him grief every minute of every day.
"Well, we're told he's going to be crisscrossing the country over the final 27 days of this race, Lana, starting in Pittsburgh, in Pennsylvania on Thursday, the biggest battleground state."
"One of them is she's going to give 25,000 to new homeowners."
"It's always a nail-biter, right?"
And the media just picked it up.
And so that's what we got out of President Trump with three weeks to election day here.
"So again, it's a nail biter."
"Obviously, not a good approval rating for president, part of why Democrats no longer have Joe Biden as their nominee."
"Because as I have been saying for months now, Donald Trump was never hitting 50% in battleground state polls."
I asked him about that.
 Trump's rally underscores the critical role of battleground states like Pennsylvania for both Republicans and Democrats in the upcoming election.
They do not want to specifically talk about any of Trump's legal woes.
Trump wants no part of that because he sees the mainstream.
"Technically, you don't own your steam games."
I think that he wins on a tie.
"Greitens didn't drop out, but Parnell did."
"Trump is doing better in every single poll in the RCP average compared to 2020, not just one of them, not just two of them."
Stierwald highlights how these regions have oscillated between supporting democratic candidates like Obama and republican candidates like Trump.
"And if she doesn't get North Carolina for her, it basically comes down to Pennsylvania."
"I'm excited that he is on Team Humanity, you know?"
"So today we'll be looking at a 0.5 victory for Kamala Harris where it's currently at right now, despite a huge win for Donald Trump."
So that means it was so valuable to them.
I'm just in college Trump is only up by two.
This is the best I can give y'all.
And now there's actually been an update on the overall voter registration edge.
You could find me mostly on Instagram at tatju77.
He's always been a supporter of the channel And you know what's so wild is he left a lot of comments in the yt system with flagging a man.
He's here so much.
"All right, so it seems we're at the point in time right now where every move by every candidate really reveals some strategy after the debate, where's Kamala Harris headed?"
We have to understand that Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet are not looking to end this conflict.
Big picture here.
"A lot of these Gunter voters, they're for sure gonna vote for Trump."
We need these.
So are they doing enough to reach out to those voters?
Biden was able to pick off those working class voters.
"In the show's part two that premiered early this year, Morelos got to display her singing talent for the first time in the series."
"Meanwhile, black support for the Democrats has fallen by 14%."
The last people only got to hear like 10 minutes of him talking.
"But in terms of the electorate, it is true that we just have to keep breaking it down using the swingometer."
Trump did pick JD Vance for his VP pick What do you think of JD?
And you can't count it folded like that?
"Female, it's gonna be tough on abortion."
If the rap on her as I read is correct.
Didn't comment about complaints about Lew.
What don't you like about Trump?
I do feel that people are being pushed to the limit.
"We saw what Florida did, you know, what they've done in 2020 and 2016 has been amazing how quickly they get their vote in."
Don't just shoot other people's ideas down.
"In Wisconsin, there was a lot of it though."
"Yeah, I can imagine there."
They were claiming that Biden actually won Pennsylvania by seven back in 2020.
Kamala Harris received 52% of the vote and Donald Trump 48%.
"With that as a backdrop, the vice president has no choice other than to make that choice today or tomorrow."
I think that's the one to go with.
We have a state director.
Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote to Donald Trump 48%.
"Even if I can financially support it, I will do it as well."
What makes Donald Trump so special?
Will he count the votes for the Democratic candidate that won or will he not?
"Many people didn't think it was appropriate for you to be here today, Scott said."
"And a quick reminder that we were told for weeks now, no, for about a month now that Kamala Harris's best polling was going to happen in August."
I love women Just not her.
"But Kamala Harris, as generally her campaign has been operating, is actually operating in a proactive manner as opposed to a reactive manner."
That has been rejected.
They do this crap every single year.
Yet Republicans still outregistered Democrats in Pennsylvania with new voters.
"I think that for Kamala Harris, her lane is not only being the younger pressure candidate out here, but it's also being able to galvanize voters who in all honesty had stepped outside of politics, who didn't want to hear the bickering, who did not want to see two super seniors running against each other, who wanted to see a path to a future, not a look back to the past."
"Yeah, even if I move this, it's still a Trump win."
 So our monitors take us back to a battleground blitz by Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.
There's nothing happening down in D.C. other than things screwing us.
"And what opened my eyes even more was what happened in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023."
I haven't seen nothing done.
Things are going to change.
They're going to steal the election and they're going to try to say it again because the Democrats are behind it.
He's running for president.
"He attended his rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, just last Sunday when the former president called Kamala Harris mentally impaired."
"We'll see what happens when it comes to that, possibly Democrats threatening a government shutdown."
"But I am going to start reacting to them a lot more, you feel me?"
I want to bring in now Jennifer Barrasso from CBS News Pittsburgh we just heard from Caitlin that the vice presidential running mate was there on the stage talking to the entire crowd but you Jen actually got to pose some questions to Ohio senator J D Vance what did he have to tell you.
"But also, he has relatively high favorability numbers amongst moderates and even Trump voters as well."
"We're living in you know what I'm saying, but when I say that I want to make it clear I'm not saying that that was fake, but you best believe in the blogosphere in this internet era Individuals are most definitely saying that here We go everybody with the Donald Trump staged a shooting just to win the election First of all Donald Trump would definitely stage a shooting with fake blood and all that just to win the election Absolutely, I agree with that But think about it He would have to fake out the CIA the United States government is going to take every resource and asset They're going to make sure that this was real if it was fake they're gonna find out So you'd have to know that I am a fake out the CIA."
"And Donald Trump does have this branding that has worked well for him of this businessman, this successful businessman persona that can run this country like a business."
She has a history.
"So I have to get y else you want to say to t are on the fence that ar on CNN and mainstream mea So when you hear he's a r know all the bad things, and you'll find out the t you so excited?"
"McGarvey said, and again, you've got President Biden talking about hope."

Jay O'Brien joins me live now from Chicago where the DNC is set to take place.
He'll be going to this next event in your hometown.

The article highlights widespread concerns among Pennsylvania Democrats who are using words like worried and anxious about how things are being handled.
"So it's absolutely massive news, even if it's like a small number in terms of the overall numbers, right?"
"OK, do you notice who he's speaking to right now?"
I'm excited that he's here.
He can't help himself.
"Because remember, Biden only beat Trump in Arizona by just 11,000 votes."
What's notable there is it's higher than Biden's current rating.
Watch this 14 million votes and they throw them out of office and you know what?
Voters will decide what the best direction is for the future of the country.
But Donald Trump maintains himself to be in a very solid position.
Do you remember what America was like?
Keep the pin in your hand and it's right here.
Let me open this up to me as you're trying to figure out if you're okay.
"The police are preparing to manage the protests with strategies aimed at preventing violence, while Trump has condemned such demonstrations and hinted at a military response if elected."
Do you guys think this was the right move for Trump?
You click on get or the cloud icon and enjoy it.
What did you think of the interview and why do you think Fox?

"Oh, it's a runaway Trump train."
Watkins says each candidate has their strengths.

"Mabintie, you've written a couple of pieces looking at one of the key battleground states that's going to decide this year's presidential election, and that's Pennsylvania."
"I think he's going to win independence in every single swing state, which is also going to help combat the advantage that the Democrats have in a state like Pennsylvania."
These are known as the swing states or battleground states.
And that is that this election is really about the future.
Any final message you would leave for Donald Trump if you were watching this?
"So in addition to sort of becoming more aggressive in her messaging about the former president, you see her doing media interviews all over the place."
Talked about me on the campaign trail.
"And so very, very different circumstances."
"And once you yield a little bit, that's just the beginning."

I don't I believe the election was stolen So we're out here today in Pennsylvania ahead of this Trump rally.

On the Republican side it's a little more negative.
"I got to tell you, I've heard voters for Trump."
"The Democrats are down 416,000 mail-in ballot requests from where they were four years ago at the same time."
"As inflation and interest rates are coming down and the stock market hitting another all time record high today, the Dow up 200 points closing for the first time above 43,000."

They wounded themselves.
"And I know you could argue that's a different pollster, but the Washington Post was involved with this poll and they found Biden up by seven."

She lost.
"Counties such as Erie and Luzerne have demonstrated a tendency to flip between supporting Democratic and Republican candidates, driven largely by local economic conditions, cultural identity, and the overarching sentiment of their constituents."
So what do you make of that description?
It could be any of those things.
"We need a stern president, somebody that's healthy, somebody that can speak for the people."
And that's why it's very quick in Pennsylvania.
"In another Beacon research poll, Harris edges out Trump with 50% to Trump's 48%, a two point advantage for Harris."
"Congressman Scott Perry, Republican from the state of Pennsylvania."
"For some Pennsylvania elected official Democrats, party leaders and allies, 20 of whom, political spoke to to this article, they're anxious, the in-state operation has set them back."

So I'm not voting for the bully.
"You know, typically a candidate would scale back their travels because they would start to prep for debate."
The Secret Service director told ABC News that there were actually officers inside that building from when they where they opened fire.

He needs them to come home in a big way.
"And I think they're the and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by national guard or if really necessary by the military."
"Number one, he's saying that he has the leverage before he even gets into office to make a deal with foreign leaders."
"But if we go down here, we could see Insider Advantage is one of the worst."
"And I want you to watch what happens over the next few days, just like the last time."
"As you'll see here, we have the New York Times poll from October 7th to 10th that shows the race being Harris 49, Trump 45."
We got to see what happens.

I don't think it paints a whole picture.

"In contrast, Trump's speeches were more about airing personal grievances than offering solutions to the nation's problems."
"However, what we could see from this poll is this Insider Advantage name."
President Trump hit the stage.

Kamala Harris is trying to penetrate that.
"And if after you've gone through that and the folks who are unconvinced say, Yeah, I don't know, I still like them."

That's what I was talking about yesterday on my story I'm batting a thousand with motherfucking predictions.
Pennsylvania's voters can't seem to decide.
"That's pretty big, man."
" Mark, I've been excited to talk to you about this."
"If you don't get those references, just let it go."
"Now, I know these are different elections."
We appreciate it as always.
Like her changing her position on fracking.
Reproductive rights or LGBTQ rights are kind of equally important.
"She has no policies and she's full of word salad If Kamala Harris were elected president, she'd be the first female president You're obviously a woman would send mean anything to you the final so-called glass ceiling."
It only costs us 500 grand.
"Not for fun, but you know, just as a hobby."
"That's a pretty big break, at least symbolically."
"We're going to get number one, your utility."
"You would, right?"
Bring in the Amish and the horse drawn buggies.
That pretty girl.
"If you're a Democrat in Pennsylvania, you don't want this to be just 1.8 million votes or whatever."
It just kept going up after Trump.
"Oh, let's see."
"You know what these people told me to in like Democrat rallies in Democrat rallies, they don't accept these books."
You know I think that Kamala has a lot of good plans for the future and I think that since she wasn't the one that was mainly in charge you know even though she is vice president there is Congress and there is checks and balances so like she can't do everything I think that with her being more empowered president I think that she would be able to do a better job.
"Aaron, tight numbers going into the debate tomorrow."
Opinion polls have shown Harris bringing fresh energy to the Democratic campaign and closing the gap with former President Trump both nationally and in many battleground states.
"Harris continued her campaign blitz, focusing on black male voters, with an interview on the radio show, The Breakfast Club."
"You know, you could have these intentions and then when you get into the presidency, you don't have the ideological foundations or rudder that can make you address questions that come to your desk and personnel decisions."
"From Washington, D.C. today."
"Now, in fairness, his other big economic plan is to slap tariffs on everything from food to TVs."
New York Times had Kamala Harris up four points.
"No, we're not ignoring anything in Pennsylvania."
That's what I want for our country.
"I want to pull on a thought you just mentioned, because this has been something I've been thinking about a lot, too, is when you are echoing dictators, when you're trying to crush the media, when you are trying to silence people out there, make it harder to vote, that's not a sign of strength."
But also he represented a sprawling rural district in southern Minnesota for six terms in the U.S. House.
"But this is really, really huge that he's not going to be on the ballot in Pennsylvania, of course, because that would eat into the numbers for Kamala Harris."
"But attacking this system made up of our neighbors from communities all across Pennsylvania, Republican and Democrat alike, is not the answer."
You can't win on those things.
I think the bigger problem are the people from within.
"So talk to me about the messaging that you are hearing, particularly from your former roommate running for Vice President here, and the extent to which you think that that is resonating with voters."
"Like that's the number one, you know, most generic thing you can say about someone if you're trying to make people vote for them, she's a strong candidate with a great track record."
"And these are the counties that are in southeastern Pennsylvania, right outside of Philadelphia."
"No other country has as low inflation as the United States does right now, and we're expecting rate cuts from the Fed in September later this month."
"And my personal religious beliefs cannot be put on somebody else, even though I may consider what they're doing wrong."
"I mean, clearly, nobody wants to see any of these people hurt."
We really are trying to just get one to three percent of those Republicans to vote for Kamala.
"I have already provided them many times, including quite recently, and they were flawless."
"I don't know how long it was, Libby."
"After taking over the fry cooker at a McDonald's in the suburbs outside Philadelphia, looking to push his unsupported claims, the Vice President Harris lied about working at the fast food chain when she was in college."
"Now, Pennsylvania has been a tricky one for Democrats."
"They can cause people, compel people, persuade people to do things, to act."
Only 32 percent of CNN watchers say protecting our democracy.
And now you look at it.
"You know, we have said all along that this decision was a deeply personal decision that Vice President Harris was going to have to make."
"He's OK, but I'm sure."
He has a lead in Georgia.
It's almost like this echo chamber isn't tight enough to keep these people over here in the MSNBC column contained.
I think that some of these markets are definitely being manipulated by ideological people who do not mind spending money.
Have a wonderful day wherever it is you are.
It's really notable because this is the first time the Trump or Vance Trump has not been to Pittsburgh.
"Robert Costa joins us now from Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania."
Caitlin Huey Burns joins us from there.
And I think it's because people must feel like they're not being heard or represented.
"So I would say the good people of Pennsylvania, yes, we've made a lot of strides."
Does the campaign internally have a sense that that has begun to waver?
"So you go to Pennsylvania House District 139, with just about all of the votes in, and the Republican won 58.3% to 41.7%, a margin of 16.6%."
He voted for Barack Obama once but is now all in on Donald Trump.
"I mean, Time magazine, think of this Time magazine."
And what was that camera?
I ain't got nothing else to say.
So with the latest polls we've seen and the average and the averages that we've seen we've seen a slight downtick in the national picture for Harris International lead since the peak that we've seen back in September.
Catch us up on the messaging today and the approach for Trump in these important suburban counties just north of Philly.
Biden's approval rating is below 40.
"But I was lucky enough to have people around me, a stepfather for a time, my grandparents, teachers, coaches, and most of all, my mom, who taught me the difference between right and wrong, who showed me what it meant to have integrity and to be honest and to be responsible and to work hard and to treat other people the way I wanted them to treat me."
We're really happy they were able to sponsor these polls because otherwise we were not going to be able to do any state polling in September.
"And of course you don't hear them mention inflation at all, but this just goes to show you how much these people manipulate things."
Will I going forward?
"You're probably doing well in the really big counties, too."
"President Biden talking about tangible benefits, whether it's healthcare, whether it's social security, whether it is jobs, jobs, and better paying jobs, whether it's helping unions, being there with workers, whether it's infrastructure, whether it's the chips act bringing important jobs here in the semiconductor industry, investing in America, whether it is protecting veterans, protecting seniors."
"Former President Obama among those lending a helping hand, deploying to Michigan and Wisconsin this week before campaigning with Harris for the first time on Thursday here in Georgia."
And the people of Pennsylvania were better off under President Trump's leadership than they are today.
"And I think as Pennsylvanians get more familiar with the vice president and the governor, they are going to see them as the people who can help move not just our Commonwealth, but our entire country forward."
It was just Trump way overperformed his numbers by 3%.
"The former president actually went on Univision and took some very tough questions, including for one Latino farmer who picked strawberries and said his job is usually done by undocumented workers."
"This marks a substantial shift from previous polling in May, where Trump had a nearly 10-point lead over President Biden in some of these states."
"And I thought something very interesting when you take the same poll, such as Emerson, they found Trump right now up by a point compared to their same poll back in 2020 in Pennsylvania."
"You know what, Megan, I can't speak for Dan here."
And that in many ways looks like her challenge and her task in the remaining weeks of the campaign.
No question about it because the Democrat party of her day is not the Democrat party today.
That's so important.
He knows about it.
"For Donald Trump and his cronies, freedom means that the powerful can do whatever they please."
"It was, and it all started with a disastrous surrender from Afghanistan."
"They don't take us seriously, you know?"
You know the geography of the state very well.
It's really exciting.
"Look, I understand the former president is desperately trying to stop this bill because it's not he's not interested in solving the border problem."
Who's actually buying this sudden change of heart?
"Now, some people, because I'm having conversations around the country with folks as I go campaigning, and I'll hear some people say, you know, well, I remember the economy when those first two years with Trump, they were pretty good."
"So that's a lot of the work and then what we're doing in terms of the tax credits, we know that there's a great return on investment in moving increased homeownership in America."
So double check real fast either way.
I know you're a fan of that a proponent of it Next time you come on we'll get into that a little bit more.
He is beloved.
"My bet is that they definitely will bring it up, especially just because there's been so much attention on Pennsylvania."
I did look at his victory margin or lost margin in 2020.
Lovely.
"Right now, it's Harris plus one."
"So if you're just joining us, former President Donald Trump has been shot in the ear or the back of the head."
But you go up to Erie right now and it feels and the reporting is very similar to what I was experiencing in 2016.
It did.
And you guys did do a great job of keeping them on task and on track.
And how big of an issue is this for voters in Pennsylvania?
Like that's the ego kicking.
She's doing abysmally among union voters.
They're just totally forgetting about the latinx.
It's unfair.
Now a lot of them get on board the ones who don't get on board some have retired some have left some have been primary voted out and what's left is a conference that is much more aligned with the Trump agenda than what we saw in a first term.
"Yeah, maybe Eli will pull up."
"Pennsylvania is a wonderful, wonderful state and an incredibly complex state to win in, and of course, to govern in."
Red Eagle out.

He's never wanted to release his medical records before.
"Harris is pushing hard on this front, but she's facing some challenges too."
What do you think is happening with the average Catholic in Wisconsin and in Pennsylvania?
It's a place that was won by President Biden.
"And, you know, by the time we get to Election Day, it's going to be much more than 22."
"I got a text message from another brother in one of our local churches in a PA conference who an elder who texts me and say, you need to call so and so because they're going to be at the rally."
"Because when they take a look at the lead for Trump over Harris, even according to real politics, when you take a look at where it is, when you're looking at just the 538 averages here, they are far, far, far better."
35 trillion crypto.
We're going to be electing Trump because Trump is looking for a de-escalation of this war.
"I mean, you mentioned Marist, their tide poll from the Hill, and Emerson, that was done between September 15th and September 18th."
The suburbs of Ohio have also been a key battleground in recent elections.
"Whether it's the industrial economy, health care access, or social issues, the concerns of voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio will be at the forefront of the national political conversation."
One of the stories that you wrote had to do with an interesting quirk in Pennsylvania's impact on the Electoral College.
It's always August.
"One, it's underfunded and two, the funding we have wasn't being directed to the school districts that were most in need, the kids that needed it most."
Everything about it.
"And so our team, when we're registering someone to vote, we ask every single person, are you going to be in town on Tuesday, November 5th?"
"I think the energy she's brought to the campaign, the fact that she's a woman and women's rights are, are going to be a big deal here in Pennsylvania."
Trump's strength remains solid in rural Pennsylvania.
"Well, look, she is holding an event in Bucks County, Pennsylvania."
You're going to have much higher turnout.
"Don't forget to like this post, subscribe to our updates, and leave a comment below sharing your thoughts on which campaign resonates with you the most."
The poll taken right before the announcement had Trump up by five.
"But I thought the vice president did a great job, both laying out her vision and also prosecuting the case against Donald Trump, showing the clear contrast, particularly on the issue of abortion and the fundamental freedom for women to be able to make decisions over their own bodies."
And that's why I'm running because I think career politicians like Bob Casey are really hurting our great country.
"Now Arizona, on the other hand, has trended almost 9 points to the left since 2012, when Romney carried it by 10 points over Obama."
But it is a tight race.
So you can give that to Trump as well if you're trying to orchestrate his path to victory here doesn't seem like he's at risk of losing any single state that he won in 2020.
"If they come out with something on Trump in October or around the election, I'm not saying a hundred percent."

"But there is a feeling in some parts of the country that those numbers that they see, that the stock market, for example, doesn't necessarily affect them."
It would kill him.
Now Trump is plus three in Pennsylvania and you do have the Senate very close with Casey only up by two over McCormick.
And David McCormick's is like a double red flag.
"Straight, clean bill of hell."
We got to stop.
" Join us now, Mike Allen, co-founder of Axios."
"It has to be, again, by rule of law."
And I would have to give the edge to McCormick in that just because Casey is the incumbent.
I think there's a lot of work to be done.
"I mean, I'm telling you, you can't make this up."
But for whatever reason it's considered a high-quality poll.
"And when it comes to immigration and the border, what is some of the polling revealing about the tightness in Arizona and other border states?"
"These counties voted for like Al Gore and John Kerry, for crying out loud."
WRL's Laura Levine will have live coverage of Harris' visit later tonight.
He said he's not really sure he doesn't know what President Biden is going to do.
The problem is I just think they're for a lot of Trump voters.

It's definitely a possibility.
"I think it's going to happen because we're just getting out too close for either side to back out, and everybody assumes it's going to happen."
"Obviously, a bunch of ancestral Democrats, they became Republicans."
Did Donald Trump lose?

It's a doppelganger of what we've already seen.
Well the DNC didn't give us enough support.
I just think it speaks to some subtle subtly who we think is going to be an effective communicator for people and who isn't that I don't know if it's necessarily true.

"The New York Post observed that Shapiro has come under fire from the left for his support for school choice in Pennsylvania, but he's lost support from Republicans, too after he reversed his position on a school choice bill, which he previously supported."
"The results are just two counties, the Bellwether counties of Pennsylvania are tossed up."
"What's at stake, the road ahead."
It was a he and comes back a she.
"It's cool, it's my first time here, I've never seen it before."
This is just the popular vote.
Tim's a veteran.
"And he's out there saying, well, you know, everyone wanted it this way."
"Well, he wouldn't be hurting himself, but it sounds like today he kept his focus."
That's a better deficit for Harris than it was with Joe Biden on the issue of the economy.
"She's worked on some big campaigns, right?"
That's a fact.
"And then this wax statue of Zac Efron showed up and said, Thank you, Lertning, never, Sir, it's worse."

"Additionally, Harris is making a strong push to connect with younger voters, emphasizing the importance of education and student loan forgiveness."
"The early turnout is high, with many Pennsylvanians voting ahead of time thanks to increased mail-in ballot access and heightened political engagement."
"The bipartisan deal that Kamala Harris supported, even though it was written by one of the most conservative Republicans in Congress, and Donald Trump deliberately lobbied against it and told Republicans, don't vote for it."
"So it's complicated, you know, in terms of how we look at it, but the inside battle for it and the likelihood of it being the tipping point state is so high."
"Now, back to Pennsylvania's pivotal role."
"He ended up at one point saying, no one wants to hear questions anyway."
Let me start by saying this.
Do you expect that Senator Casey will run a little bit ahead of Vice President Harris?
But the one thing that we do know is that Donald Trump is the favorite in Pennsylvania.
But this is one of them.
"People still feel bad about the economy, even if their own personal economic picture is not horrible."
"However, Pennsylvania stands out, with top strategists from both the Harris and Trump campaigns viewing it as the state most likely to swing the election."
You live in the city?
Their streets are unsafe.
"It's about who we are, how we treat each other."
And Kamala is not the answer.
"So, we're currently 29 days away from the 2024 presidential election."
We're not derogatory.
As you can tell I am not a black man.
"Well, let's be clear."
"Now, with Harris carrying the Democratic torch and Trump eyeing a comeback, Pennsylvania is once again in the spotlight."
Or I should say they don't necessarily have a huge impact on the vote over the last few election cycles.
How did you get into farm to farm to see how m get involved in that?
How did we get here so fast?
"But he thinks that the offshoring of American manufacturing, which was accomplished, essentially by investors over the course of many decades, was a mistake."
"No, no, no."
I don't even know that we've seen that before.
And then all of a sudden there's a weird convergence towards like five points.
"But you know, RFK Jr. made a comment, you know, say we're being poisoned by the air."
"Before we move on to the polls, subscribe to the channel for free right now and like the video."

I think it's working.
"And whenever I go, Hannibal Lecter, you know what I'm talking about."
All the people talk.
And what type of influence is Musk trying to push?
"I'm the biggest trout in the pod, and I'm the biggest trout in me."

The guy had 14 million votes.
"Well, you know, I because he was a sick puppy and we have sick puppies coming into our country."
I'm probably wrong.
He just has to shift the entire state of Pennsylvania into his column.
"That is huge in the state of Pennsylvania, which I think it's fair to say this election is going to come down to Pennsylvania, Michigan Harris is up 50 to 45 and Wisconsin Harris is up one point."
"The current polling data, showing a 50-50 split between Harris and Trump, indicates that Michigan will again be a critical battleground in 2024."

It's a source of bargaining in the world.
The Trump campaign also said that Trump knows Harris's record well from her time as attorney general of California and San Francisco's district attorney and is ready to discuss her policies.
"Well, I mean, that's what people were saying."
You don't really care that there was a secret chord.
Everybody should go to truth immediately.
That's what Kamala Harris will do.
Let's say it one more time.
"On the other hand, Harris is focusing on expanding healthcare access, addressing climate change, and promoting social justice to energize urban voters with younger demographics, and the state's growing minority populations."

My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency.
"So, as you said, Musk offering one million dollars a day here on out until the election to voters in battleground states who signed this petition."

It's about character.
Nobody's leaving.
It'll be weird to see.
"We win, Pennsylvania We win the whole yes in a town hall style event in the western suburbs of Philadelphia The former president stuck to his top issues attacking Vice President Harris over inflation and immigration He pledged to shut the southern border and Russia's war in Ukraine lower prices at the grocery store and bring down interest rates to 2% while providing few details on how he'd accomplish all that people don't think of grocery You know it sounds like not such an important word when you talk about homes and everything else, right?"

 here is showing a narrow two-point lead over former president Donald Trump that is well within the margin of error our political editor Dennis Welch is here now to break down those numbers yeah and when you say within the margin of error what you're basically saying statistically it's a dead heat now Arizona's family commissioned the survey in partnership with the local public affairs firm high ground and it reaffirms what we've been seeing so far that Arizona's 11 electoral college votes which could determine who wins the White House are still very much in play for both candidates here are the top line numbers they reveal Harris leading Trump 47 percent to 45 the results also reveal that 45 percent of those surveyed say they've already made up their mind to vote for Harris while 41 percent say they will definitely be voting for Trump I think one of the biggest takeaways here is that the race is very close and getting closer we've seen some surveys where Trump has a narrow lead we've seen others where Harris has a slight lead all of them have been within the margin of error Paul Bents is the longtime Arizona pollster who conducted the survey commissioned by Arizona's family his data reveals that Harris is doing a better job convincing voters to cross party lines at this point the vice president has convinced more than 12 percent of likely Republican voters to support her on the other hand Trump has only managed to convince 1.7 percent of Democratic voters to back his candidacy the two candidates are also evenly split with voters who are unaffiliated with any party while Trump is leading by double digits with independence what we're really seeing is that the Democrats are much more solidified behind their candidate they very much circled the wagons whereas Republicans are still struggling internally with at least a portion of their party Harris is also doing better than expected with voters 65 years and older the two candidates are evenly split at 48% among this reliably Republican block and like the previous two presidential cycles Trump is doing much better in rural parts of the state than Harris while the VP leads in Arizona's two most populous counties Maricopa and Pima and this survey was conducted at the end of last week another interesting data point here is the gender gap with Harris winning more than 52 percent of female voters to Trump's 40 percent while Trump is winning over 50 percent of male voters to Harris's 42 percent yes we've been saying for a long time it's going to come down to a couple hundred thousand voters in seven swing states of course Arizona very pivotal and the last presidential race was decided by like ten point five thousand here in Arizona yeah and if you look at the data here maybe it's not surprising but 86 percent are pretty much made up there they're locked in so 14 percent out there maybe maybe could be moving movable but you know it's going to be very close we knew that I know the election is a little over a month away but remember early voting starts next week so we're already in the middle of this and Dennis these were a likely voters not just registered voters yeah these were picked by basically on how often they vote these are people who are reliable voters out there they wanted to get a sense of who were they supporting how are they voting what's going to happen with them now that does leave open some room could there be an influx of new voters out there have Republicans identified voters who haven't typically voted in the last election cycle the last couple could Democrats do the same thing there's always a lot of questions to be answered well with these polls there's always things you can look at with a little suspicion just like every poll but as politicians have told me for years decades now the only poll that matters is in November yeah take a good thing they call this a snapshot in time which is what it is we like it it's interesting to see the breakdown Dennis thank you
