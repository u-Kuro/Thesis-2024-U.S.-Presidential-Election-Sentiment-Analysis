"We've seen crime increase in inner cities in Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh."

"And if after you've gone through that and the folks who are unconvinced say, yeah, I don't know, I still like him, then you then I think you have to then say, yeah, but what about character?"
So he's not talking about the people at all.
Great breakdown.
And he had a career of doing that.
"Now Biden is also a moron, but that's been worsened by his declining mental state because of his advanced age."
It's not going to work.
They're so efficient.

So what made you come Trump rally?
Because I found that exchange quite interesting on the debate stage.
"If I'm over there, I'm going to stop it."
That's massive change.
"But he's proven himself time and time again, just incapable of that baseline level of discipline."
So there is a problem in the Kamala Harris campaign with black males.
I think it's I think it's a very uncontroversial statement to say that only 26 percent of CNN viewers think the Republican Party is the biggest enemy facing America.
So I get it.
Candidates are not allowed pre written notes on stage and microphones will be muted when it's not their turn to speak.
"The numbers are in, and we now know 67 million people tuned in for the presidential debate, between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump."
It has packed a lot of conversation guys and these are some of the clips that have gathered on the reaction of what happened during Donald Trump's rally at Pennsylvania.
The damage is so bad and so it's been done.
All play crucial roles in determining the victory of any candidate.
We are so excited about tonight.
Give us a sense of how the state has voted in the past flipping from between red and blue.
He's like having Jeeves change his tire.
It was just so soon.

"And one of the best ways to counter the bad actionsâ€”and let's be clear, the State Election Board is the latest in a line of bad actions perpetrated by Republicans, starting with Governor Brian Kemp and supported, unfortunately, by Secretary of State Rafton Berger that have weakened access to the polls since 2020."
48% voted for Sniffy Joe in 2020.
"And I know you could argue that's a different pollster, but the Washington Post was involved with this poll and they found Biden up by seven."
But it's especially weird when you consider what Trump had to say last week.
I'm recording my video and I'm going back in the house.
It is time to call on God's army that is armed with our voices and our vote.
"But still, it's very likely that Harris, she probably loses, you know, a little bit of ground with black voters, according to most polling."

I'm sitting down with Dick Pullman full-time writer in residence and journalism professor here at Penn He also wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer for 22 years and now writes about politics weekly on his own platform.

There are a lot of legitimate inquiries into whether it exists at all.
"So Arizona, I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard?"
"But this time around, I believe it's a must win state for Trump."
Allow me to explain.
It is such an honor to be here with you all today and I am so grateful to be here with Vice President Kamala Harris.
Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned in Western Pennsylvania yesterday.
Kamala Harris is trying to penetrate that.
" When you watch this clip, I want you to ask yourself, can you ever imagine Donald Trump acting this way towards voters?"
They're covering him.
Biden was up by four.
The old tank.
That is fine for Pennsylvania.
And this is a state that's razor thin.
"So there is no way Biden is going to give an edge to Trump on that in 2024, especially since Biden, you know, he carries himself, he describes himself as the most pro-union president in American history."
So here's the solution.
Same with Trump in the cities.
"I mean, you're the man."
Like I ran or something?
This is about the world.
They are allowed then to focus on other people.
"And while I certainly do not believe it will be enough for an electoral college landslide, it will be enough for an electoral college victory if this momentum maintains itself."

Make sure to subscribe get in the comments You know stay tuned for the updates and everything.
"If that holds, if the Democrats are able to keep up that enthusiasm from here until election day, they're going to be looking pretty good."
Pennsylvania knew Joe Biden and they knew the old Joe Biden and they were comfortable with the older Joe Biden.
We see that Kamala Harris wins in this particular case.
"So if the Harris campaign can't win over Philly, they're in big trouble."
"They can't believe that she just, you know, fell out of a coconut tree, as it were, and has nothing to do with Joe Biden, his policies, his results, because she is his number two."

On nonstop.
"I mean, from my perspective, it seemed like he's hands on with a lot of things."
"The coalitions are not as fixed as it seems, right?"

But what do you think?
"It is Harris plus 8, and it was surveyed between August 14th and 17th."
"Yeah, I wish it never happened."
"He basically was, especially in Bush's first term, he was seen as basically like the co-president."
It's just crazy.
Look at that Trump.
"Harris comes off of a weekend where Donald Trump was in Colorado and California, two states where he is extremely unlikely to win, as we know, Vlad."
"First, the Democratic campaign is very sophisticated here."
He missed on purpose.
"On the other hand, Harris is focusing on expanding healthcare access, addressing climate change, and promoting social justice to energize urban voters with younger demographics, and the state's growing minority populations."
Why would you say her name?
They're all for Trump.
This is an illustration of why Donald Trump is going to win the state of Pennsylvania.
And then I think government set in with whatever it is that they do.
"They are a left-leaning pollster, and they found the race at best tied for Harris."
"Harris left DC today for Pennsylvania, making a stop at a small business in Johnstown before heading to a rally in Wilkes-Barre tonight."
We're going to support this black woman who understands our collective indigenous black organizations.
"Well, now you don't have Joe on the ballot."
What has she done right in the last 90 odd days that she's been in the race?
One of those values that Ruben shares and that's talked a lot about in the campaign is freedom.
Kamala Harris received 46% of the vote and Donald Trump 48%.
Why do they need special protections?
It didn't but there is an EV plant today building batteries there.
Pennsylvania is not a battleground state and you don't have to win the Commonwealth to win the White House.
She wants to limit all immigration.
And that's the only reason why probably I would not vote for him.
"And I mean, it was heartbreaking."
Maybe we should conduct more surveys because this doesn't seem right.
And what a fresh breath air.
It's the only way I can afford to graduate.
"Now, I will tell you how he protected you, quote, unquote."
Mastriano is also another one who has had some comments on abortion saying that it should be banned as early as six weeks until a woman's pregnancy.
Now she's expected to add campaign events but nobody's commenting on it.
It will liberate.
And there's been a lot of movement there recently.
We're going to have to slug it out.
He used to do that.
Donald Trump is your president.

"A red county right next door, by the way, to Lackawanna County."
It's a good living for your family.
She brings her own unique voice and perspective to the race.
This is the best I can give y'all.
Am I saying Trump's going to win it by 21 points?
"It's been purple for years, though."
Because she has none.
Silver's model also predicts that Harris has an 88.8% chance of winning the entire election if she takes Pennsylvania.
It stunts growth.
We're going to run through this pretty quick.
 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris portraying herself as an underdog candidate and a fighter She addressed her party's convention on this closing night here in Chicago right now We're getting reaction to the vice president's speech from some undecided voters in the crucial battleground of Pennsylvania Seeing as Gary Tuchman is in Allentown.
And what we'd love to see now is essential the Democratic Party to move as well.
He understood how to sell it.

"So without wasting much time, let's get right into it."

A panel of judges is requiring a county to give voters a chance to fix problems with mail-in ballots and allow them to vote by provisional ballot if needed.

The Pennsylvania ruling can serve as a strategic talking point in debates and public appearances.
"If she loses Pennsylvania, she can't win."
"The favorability ratings in Pennsylvania, 48 percent of likely voters have a favorable view of Harris, while 43 percent have an unfavorable view of her."
"But when Republicans do it, in Georgia, for example, or they do very well in terms of primary turnout in some key states, oh, no, that doesn't matter."

"That was the George W. Bush era, the Obama era, and then a little bit of the Trump era."

Liberals try and say like they way overestimated conservatives in every single state.

Raise fresh alarms about vote counting delays and chaos in battleground states.

Governor has long been mentioned as a favor to be a potential running mate for Harrison.

No one's special.
Now let's go back to the McDonald's and see Trump in action.

I want the borders closed.
This is actually one of the few places where former President Donald Trump won that is actually represented by a Democrat in Congress.
"However, Harris faces challenges in rural and traditional industrial areas, where her green energy policies may raise concerns about job losses."
And you don't have to take my word for it.
And it just doesn't always fit sometimes short but it just doesn't always fit into those really neat boxes that they try to.
What a crowd.
It says independent presidential candidate Cornell West lost the legal challenge Friday in his bid to get on the ballot in the ballot ground battleground state of Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court judge Renee Cone Jubileerer in a 15 page opinion sided with the Secretary of State's office under Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro in rejecting West candidacy paperwork The Secretary of State's office said West campaign lacked or card affidavits for 14 of the West 19 presidential electors So what I think is kind of going on to I don't know if that's the case here But what it looks like is I guess a lot of the states required maybe in addition to signatures also these electors who are Promising to vote for you But what ended up happening in the state of Arizona?
But of course Latinos con Harris.

"Clearly her campaign is trying to shake stuff up because, you know, I mean, this has been a crazy couple of months and an unprecedented couple of months in terms of American politics."
The state and local officials meanwhile are like what are you talking about?
But first I have to tell you guys about shop dot ready go politics dot com because the 2024 election is around the corner.
"Prosecutors may also explore Biden's overseas business dealings, which have been the focus of Republican investigations."
"So it's, and that's a place because Biden was born in Pennsylvania and so associated with it."
This solid support is a critical part of Trump's Florida strategy.
"Pivot to, yeah."
It's America.
Are you both with Donald Trump to say you are you voted for Donald Trump?
But Trump's solid base in Florida's Hispanic community keeps him firmly in the game.
"Now, he says people should pay attention to something called the National Crime Victimization Survey."
"Now, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken now in a visit aimed at intensifying diplomatic pressure to achieve a Gaza ceasefire deal."
He mocks the person who's having an emergency in the crowd.
"You know, they were the number one, number two, Kamala brags about being the last person in the room when that decision was made."

"Patrick, just keep up all the good you do, Stephen."
"So, Pennsylvania is more than just a battleground state."
"Look, the other thing that's really key in our commonwealth is not just winning the votes of people of your own party, but winning independents and winning people who are like-minded in the other party."
Everything just goes to it.
"I will tell you, if you haven't done it, it's a crazy."
Of course.
I'm presuming it was taken after the debate.
I could be in a beautiful beach.
How long do you expect it will it will take for us to know who actually won Pennsylvania?
"At the heart of this dichotomy is Philadelphia, a major urban center that traditionally leans democratic and the surrounding suburban counties that exhibit a mix of political affiliations."
So you got more people who are eligible.
"We need a president who actually cares about solving problems, making your life better."
But they're showing Trump's in a strong position as well.
What issues matter most to them?
It was Pennsylvania that pushed Joe Biden over the threshold of 270 electoral votes after a grueling four-day wait for the final count.
"So it just doesn't really make sense to me as to why, if she really wanted to help the country out, why would she have the ability to do that right now?"
Something really wild is going on there.
You had somebody who supports gun control that won like an R plus 20 district.
"Well, look, as a former prosecutor, I know an easy mark when I see one."
Then they actually got to implement it.
We'll call them NPR Republicans.
We are looking at the number of early votes already cast in the states that allow early voting.
"So we're seeing that kind of political dynamic play out again here with this standoff, in a sense between the governor of Florida and the administration."
"In fact, I didn't even define what an essential business was because I don't believe that the government has the ability or the authority to tell you that your business isn't essential."

We encourage our audience to engage with the electoral process actively.
"It's 19 votes without it, Democrats will lose the election."

"John Ribel, you're doing a live video after the VP debate."
"Roadshow, part public relations tour, spreading the gospel of election security."
All right Selena Wang thank you for joining us this evening.
We're getting the wall street journal guy.
"And based on these NBC reports, you can see that while there is a shortcoming in terms of finance that the Trump campaign has raised versus the Harris campaign, there is this massive millionaire, billionaire swell that we've seen over the last couple months to close that gap."
He's like we don't want any more debates He's saying I've already done two there's not gonna be a third because he's counting the first one with Biden what changed Now Trump's answer on this is really twofold one He says he already won the debate.
She wants to make it easier to afford stuff like a crib or a car seat or diapers.
And I know it's been a bit of an issue to get you there in time.
"When he launched a media tour recommending not just that Mr. Biden abandoned his reelection bid, but specifically that Harris should be the new nominee."
"And as you correctly stated, I think polls have been a little bit all over the place, but in effect, we have a tide race."
The good news is there's help available.
You cannot lose that scenario.
"He's he's technically not dropped out He's suspended his campaign in swing states is gonna stay on the ballot in blue and red states So that's gonna give her a boost so Cornell not being on these ballots is absolutely huge These margins are gonna be really small like in the state of Michigan, for example, you know, the margin was 0.23% so We can actually take a look here over at the you know polls right now in Pennsylvania So in the polls in Pennsylvania right now Harris is up by 1.8 Which is solid, but I do believe if she wishes to wish to win the state of Pennsylvania She's gonna have to perform better than this."
Trump and two others were also injured in the shooting.
Could you talk about your relationship with Vice President Kamala Harris?
Not just one of them.
And I'm going to show you what this one says.
Trump touting his tariff policies for companies that are going to make their product in the USA.
"She says, I'm not going to ban fracking."
"It sort of depends on like, you know, there was like back in the in the days where like Joe Lieberman was around and, you know, Evan Bayh."
Biden was up by two points with Hispanic Latinos.
"I mean, this is a contentious race here right now, and you know from being here in Philadelphia with the presidential debate with David Muir, this could swing the Senate one way or the other."
Says Pennsylvania is such a mess and it's incredibly frustrating.
 Brand new data suggests that Donald Trump's on pace for a big victory in Pennsylvania.
I would do like a Ben Franklin clothes on each one.
"According to New York Times report, the campaign now has a legal team of hundreds of staff attorneys and thousands of volunteer attorneys to combat expected challenges from Republicans this election cycle, including possibly the results of the 2024 election."
That's who Kamala is.
Maybe the Harris campaign will pick it up in a week or so.
It was basically all that anybody and the old people could do was allow the timber to grow.
"And he's engaged in some really bizarre types of, uh, activities during this campaign."
"The only way it wasn't going to be close is if they kept Biden in and then maybe, I mean, even then I think they try and make it closer."
"We know some of those people will be voting at the polls and just because they're less afraid of a pandemic, but still, you wouldn't expect that to fully carry over."
"OK, so Canada, Kamala Harris will be back in Pennsylvania for the second time this week."
This is a big one.
That's another way of saying that's a lie.
" Yeah, this is the most bizarre Trump event I think I've ever covered."
You should just be more optimistic.
"So this idea that we're somehow not better off under, under Joe Biden."
"So whenever we register someone to vote, Megan, we get their first name, last name, email address, phone number, home address."
You're not going to see a five to 10 point miss.
And that wasn't it.
Donald Trump's campaign also shared aerial footage from Butler showing thousands of attendees.
What what about tonight?
"So if this is definitely leaning Republican oriented for the poll, then Casey would probably be losing, but he's not, and we're gonna show you something else here too."
"According to the US Department of Homeland Security, Russia, Iran and China are using generative AI to disseminate fake or divisive information to influence the 2024 US elections."
"And I know people are going to say, oh, well, he was a congressman."
"One of the reasons you also came to public attention back in February is that there has been a movement to encourage people to vote in the primaries, to vote uncommitted as an expression of their disagreement with the administration over its stance toward Israel and the Gaza war."
"This one in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, you hear him there bragging about the mugshot based on the felonies he was accused of in Georgia."
"So we got a Suffolk poll coming out there, B rated pollster."
Am I do you want to?
I am not saying that.
Is this like your annual checkup?
"According to David Urban, who ran Trump's Pennsylvania operation in 2016, the 2024 election will likely come down to a difference of just 50,000 to 75,000 votes."
And there is the sugar high is coming from the elites.
"And while I agree, this is a great optic situation, especially if they reject this and the government gets shut down because it exposes them even more the fact that they potentially want illegals to vote because otherwise why would you reject it?"
The 44th president known for his calm and cool demeanor expressed a burst of emotions rarely seen as he accused Donald Trump of threatening America's democracy.
The Philly suburbs and the Democrats do well.

"Most of the 50 states, it can be predicted which candidate they're going to vote for."
But who how times have changed.
He was the seventh most bipartisan member of Congress during his time in office.
This is among the reasons I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous.
So Bob Casey will be there in Wilkes-Barre.
"President Biden won the state in 2020 by just over one percentage point, and the swing county of Erie predicted not only Biden's victory last time around, but has also forecast every White House winner since 2008."
We want safety and security for our country.
"After all, she's been vice president, a U.S. senator, a state attorney general, a district attorney."
You live in a toss-up nation where every election brings coin toss close fights to run American government.
Your reaction to yesterday's verdict?
"But that's the whole thing with the October surprise in 2020, they silenced the one major October surprise and it's like, we're just supposed to accept it and not even talk about it."
"You know, you've run what now six or seven statewide elections that you've that you've won."

"Yes, sir."
He gets point one.
I am here to ask you to vote.

Somebody's getting 15 years.
We have nothing to do with this.
"I don't think that it's a lie to say that over the past two weeks, if she had a lead, she's squandering it."
That's a change we've seen the security posture at these Trump events recently where they're actually sometimes sweeping the cars in the vicinity for explosives and things like that.
"In the US right now, I'm pretty sure it's like 100K, but I could be wrong."
They always go to the fake news.
"They want to make, he wants to make the country great again."
Bullsh- We shouldn't use that kind of language.
"I mean, I think we've always known that Pennsylvania was going to be one of the most important states."

The three questioning the former president's character in ethics calling on Republicans to choose country over party and truth over lies.
And so she needs to try to get those January 6th wary Republicans to come along.
But the election for president was unjust.
Even if you had a family member who acted like that you might still love them but you tell them you've got a problem and you wouldn't put them in charge of anything and yet when Donald Trump lies or cheats or shows utter disregard for our Constitution when he calls POWs losers or fellow citizens vermin.
"So you're trying to say that these people don't know, you know, they got a dirty establishment or whatever."
"This time, as you say, he is still under criminal charges here in Fulton County for that."
And now the number is so small.

Kamala Harris received 52 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 48 percent.
A record record amount of votes.
So what is their message?
Instead of saying this is what happened.
"In May of 22, a year after our energy independence moved overseas, one of our fuel receipts totaled $996 for 166 gallons of fuel."
Kamala Harris as a woman of color and the first female vice president has an advantage in attracting voters in these areas.
Harris is being pulled in several different directions when choosing her VP pick.
"I mean, this Marist poll, it's 49-49 Trump and Harris."
Make sure you follow me on x links.
"It's like, well, whatever happens in Somerset, you can multiply that to 57 because there's 57 other small counties all across Pennsylvania that's gonna have the similar kinds of thing."
"But with Pennsylvania and Georgia, you for sure get 270 if you're Trump."
Let's just trust what we can see and hear ourselves.
"During a campaign stop at Erie, Harris slammed Trump for his ominous comments about the enemy within the United States and threat to deploy the military domestically."
You're deep in it.
There's a lot of people coming forth with their opinions and a lot of facts and details and stuff that we just didn't know at the time.
But you cannot tell me with a straight face that every single new Republican is just ancestral Democrats.
"Daniel like another swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, Indian Americans have really been growing in numbers now."
My man coming up to see Trump in the window.
"Pennsylvania, with its crucial 20 electoral votes, has been a political battleground that can make or break a presidential campaign."
They show Biden leading by one.
It's shaved off maybe about a point overall from where we were.
He's got a lead in Michigan.
"In 2016, former President Donald Trump won Pennsylvania by less than 1%."
I want to drain your swamp and take you to the deep state.
"But Lake's vote here is much more spread out, including a lot who say they're because there she's the party nominee and fewer who say because they like the candidate in particular, which again helps explain why Lake is running so much behind Donald Trump right now."
"so literally anything is super important and I think um Trump strategy is to sort of like alienate as many well not strategies Maybe not doing this on purpose But the Trump campaign keeps alienating more and more groups and so a common strategy appears to be to make a bigger and bigger tent So a bigger tent that she or a bigger group that she's opening up the tent to now is moderate Republicans Another group also, you know, like for example Trump is sort of alienating I guess a lot of JD Vance is doing a lot of it to where he was saying that you know Like grandmother's only role was to raise children and you know, childless women cat ladies or whatever He's they're alienating as many groups as humanly possible."
Looks like we might need an EMT right in front here.
"I mean, we've seen it when he was talking about the former senator."
"Here and there, there's a few undecided, but at least for the presidency, people generally are locked in."
I hate to say this because I say it all the time.
"But also 15 years ago, I remember traveling with Representative Ileana Russ-Laitinen to Washington, D.C. with the young dreamers who are now older and very much in the workforce, so people very much know about this subject in Miami."
I feel like you're in St. Louis.
And how would you describe the Republican Party now?
It's a valid concern for sure.
Thanks to you.
We see the Harris campaign focusing on a swing county.
"Yesterday, Trump was in Reading, Pennsylvania, where Nurse Fatschett is going all in on these bogus stories about forced gender swaps."
It's the most important.
One that's close.
There was a bombshell report dropped from Politico.
The man was set up quick and easy no musk no fuss on a building right across the way how does that happen?

They wanted Mike to caucus to pick him an idiot.
"You can't necessarily blame Republicans at large for them not doing so well in terms of running candidates who either a had little ties to the states or B just got ridiculously outspent even in the areas though that didn't really have any spending in Northeastern, Pennsylvania, in the New York media market."
This despite the fact that shootings for literally every reason over the past however many years have been by right-wing people who follow all these right-wing demagogues that are about to be like the leftist what caused this and everything and use this as their opportunity expect to see people pulling comments online of people previously talking about how Trump should get you know.

And boy did I get really nervous.
"And, and listen, this isn't like three or four years ago."
Like they realize they need someone with serious experience to come in and write the ship.
I know that name.
"They put the Rasmussen polls and yeah, if they put in Trafalgar, they're going to put in Rasmussen and that's going to push Trump ahead to you know, and there it is right there."
But so basically the Real Clear Politics polling average is Harris plus two.
"These economic shifts have reshaped the priorities and concerns of the electorate, influencing their political leanings and candidate preferences."
"But they have to go to Wilkes-Barre and Johnstown's and other places like that where they're going to lose, but maybe by a little less."

"I mean, this is a huge shift we're seeing."
I want to play a little bit of what she said at a rally in North Carolina.

Why are they the way they are?

He won in 2016.
"Truthfully, whatever they're smoking, I'd like to have some of it."
How'd Joe Biden do?
"I mean, honestly."
What is clear is that Pennsylvania will continue to play a crucial role in determining the ultimate winner of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
We have to win.

He just did the other day on the Team Trump Facebook page.
So good for walls.
But the law is clear.
So Donald Trump constantly on Fox News doing the birtherism thing.
Pennsylvania is a very important state.
I don't deny that Pennsylvania will be a close state.
The good news is that Trump has managed to convince more Republicans to do this.
"As you said, the E.P."
Totally.
"So tell me, what's it like A, to be home?"
And there's no true test and courage under fire.

Same thing in the Arizona case.

"Alright, thanks for watching."

The president is okay.

"Well, that's really not just a Tim Waltz thing."
"And I understand that politics is a team game here, meaning you've got to have partners in this."
I will sell my car right now.
The poll results are quite surprising.
"If you like what you heard, please comment, rate, share, and subscribe."
They understand that too many folks not just here in Arizona but across the country are still struggling to pay the bills.
CNN's Harris plus one New York Times.
"If you think prices are high now, Donald Trump's message is, you ain't seen nothing yet."
"The problem is even NBC admitted that like over half of Harris's support, they're going to vote before Election Day."
"So even though the voter registration numbers might be lower and the state might be becoming more Republican as far as registration, the actual vote totals are still favoring the Democratic side."

That's just my pontification of the state.
"And no, I'm not gonna mention any names."
Inflation is an issue.
That was very pivotal.
So what we need to do is to evaluate the plans of the respective candidates.
So what you see happening at the gubernatorial level should not be a replication of what could happen at the state level on the presidential election with the presidential election.
This is a tragedy.
More and more people started to dislike Kamala Harris.
That's a good sign for Trump.
Both are trying to get to 270.
What Obama meant was that the Democratic Party is seeing a slump in support for Kamala Harris among black men and that it was a major concern in the upcoming presidential election.
"Looking at Wisconsin, as I felt will be closer and in my opinion, harder to win for Harris and likely win for Trump here, given how close it's been in the past with a large secret Trump vote out there."

Her campaign could benefit from emphasizing the importance of accessible health care and economic opportunities for all Nevadans.
That's huge Absolutely massive.
Surely there's other metrics out there that show Harris having a victory.
"And I think if he articulates his message well, he stays on point."
That's what they're trying to make.
"Manchester, Lebanon."
"You're seeing more Trump polls coming in, which is obviously great."
What metric are you using the stock market?
"If we can redesign the environment so that it's less risky by default, I think people are going to be in much better shape."
"If the final numbers on approval rating in the exit polls are like even, I mean, it's, it's, she's not winning like that."

A riot.
"And then now somebody might think, well, Somerset's very small, that surely shouldn't matter."
I don't think John Fetterman saying he's going to vote for Trump.
"It's a crucial battleground this election, as the race to the White House could come down to its 19 electoral college votes."
And yet here I am talking about the crises that are unfolding thousands of miles away.
"So so if you had to say one thing to people who were undecided to if there was people who were undecided and didn't know who to vote for this election, what would you tell them?"
"We can take a look, for example, at Michigan's race for for Gretchen Whitmer."
And you're seeing enthusiasm right now.
We did much better the second time than we did the first time.
"But listen, whatever you could do, get out there."
"No, there really is only one."
" Senator Bob Casey, welcome to the show."
"But Trump repeatedly refusing Harris, releasing her detailed medical records this weekend and asking Trump who would be the oldest president ever to take the oath of office why he isn't doing the same."

"So like he'll even go to like, oh, Biden was too old."
"He's talking about, oh, she's so attractive."

But Donald Trump maintains himself to be in a very solid position.
"Just last week, I mean, I talked about this."

 Kamala's operation is being poorly run in the nation's biggest battleground.

"And what I would tell you right now is, you know, over 60 percent of Americans support an arms embargo against the Israeli government."
"Yeah, it's not a secret we've been going through a lot as a country and Yeah, Biden always promised promise a lot of politicians always promised through the years, but All of us know the world knows Everybody's experienced it the best president the world's I've seen this country that has ever seen his name is President Trump Now you can tell that he nervous that's what I like seeing though It's it's so many people that it's all crazy."
Let's play this clip.
"And you'll see, I've sent some pictures in where you can see them lined up blocks long standing in line there."
So and Trump is planning to still attend per his advisors.
And so I think he will be safe there.
And can you talk about the fact that we are seeing such a disparity in the actual ground game between the two campaigns?
And I forget the other guy that we're getting back.
" you you I'm joined now by the man, the myth, the legend, Purple Heart extraordinary American warrior Sean Parnell."
But in this final stretch we're seeing a lot of really interesting proposals that came as kind of a surprise to old guard Republicans.
"Donald Trump, who won Pennsylvania in 2016, still enjoys strong support from rural and working-class voters in the state."
"The emphasis on election integrity and security is likely to remain a central theme in the campaign, and the recent ruling in Pennsylvania serves as a reminder of the high stakes involved in this election."

Clinton just outright lost it.
"You have Erie, you have Pittsburgh, you have Harrisburg, you have you have you have Philadelphia, you have Scranton."
So anyways.
"While he's polling ahead in North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia, he still needs to flip at least one of the blue-wall states to secure the presidency."
This is a state that has been known for basic industry and energy.
They already have a bill that they signed off on.
But fine.
"I mean, this was a county Obama won by like close to 30."
They still have the Bloomberg poll on there.
"NBC News reports today that as of right now, it's just short of a million."
But we'll see.
"Again, that doesn't mean it's by some huge margin, but I would argue as of now, he is the favorite to win Pennsylvania."
The cause is unknown.
"Reginald, I'll start with you."
"Barack Marmo, CEO of Deep Well Services bluntly said, quote, I don't believe anybody in the Biden administration."
All candidates were included in this poll.
"Ah, ah, ah, ah."
It's like polls can only capture so much.
One thing that that brings to mind is the fact that Kamala Harris and Tim will also are opening up field offices across the state.
"Obviously, but it's going to be a while."
Vance has been on TV constantly and he does a lot of press conferences as well.
He's not talking about God is on the side of Republicans.
This man was in plain sight for 10 minutes plus and nothing was done about it until it was too late.
Unraveling surprising shifts that could change the course of this historic election.
"That is huge in the state of Pennsylvania, which I think it's fair to say this election is going to come down to Pennsylvania, Michigan Harris is up 50 to 45 and Wisconsin Harris is up one point."
What really troubles me about that is J.D.
"This is the kind of person who's going to help Kamala get stuff done, folks who share our values, and will do whatever they can to move the country forward."
Look for Battleground Live.
"It's like, no, that's not how it works."
"So to bring down the cost of things like groceries, she'll go after corporations that are jacking up prices, just like she went after big banks and for-profit colleges when she was Attorney General in California."
"That's the scene in Butler County, Pennsylvania where there was to be a marathon rally of former President Trump that only got five minutes in before this incident occurred."
It's things like crime.
Is that your strategy here just to have them out and everywhere?
"I'm not a doctor either, but I wasn't perfect, but I got through it."
Like there's this quote from Ryan Boyer.
"They don't want to talk about continuing the tax cuts for the billionaires, the wealthiest people in the world and the biggest corporations in the world, because they know that if they talk about that stuff, they're going to lose a lot of votes."
"Obviously when we're looking at the polls at large, everything is very close."
"I just don't like his politics and do not like his what he would like to see, which is the United States to become a dictatorship."
"And so if you have anything to say to anybody who's undecided, who needs to know who to vote for, what would you tell them?"
It's hope fuel.
The media has asked why are we here.
"Roughly a five, six point lead."
Remember how close that was last time.
"Some attendees worried about the rising cost of living, while others expressed anxieties about border security and the state of America's standing in the world."

I think there's an emerging consensus on that.
But then there's reporting on the ground.
Abortion is turning out to be a pivotal issue for voters.
The candidates are tied in the battleground states.
The vice president's decision is expected to come very soon as democratic delegates wrap up their roll call vote tomorrow.

"You could see like you could see in these polling aggregate in August, you know, she's up 13, 11 in September and early October 12, 11."
It's only continuing to rise.
And that's basically where we are.
But then we also had a Trump rally in Arizona.
Harris has established many field offices throughout the state.
I'm expecting hopefully answers.

So that one essentially a coin flip right there.
Will you be there?
"So whatever you can do it, I'm gonna really that I could push anything is to get Governor Walsh."
Let me show you this.
That's why it's good news across the board when it comes to voter registration.
"Well, for starters, if you get rid of one poll, either the Bloomberg poll or the Quinnipiac poll, just one of the two, it would go from Harris plus point five to probably Trump plus one, because both of these polls are clear outliers."
"In fairness, she did Fox News."
That is brutal.
I'm now you're deep.
"All right, Lieutenant Governor Austin Davis, thank you so much."
"And you know, there may be an event and Kamala Harris gets a bump and another assassination attempt, Donald Trump gets a bump."
So Harris absolutely can take the state too.

"Essentially all Biden needs to do is keep the blue wall, which is Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and then if Trump can flip Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada, I mean, we can move into the unprecedented electoral tie."

Senator Casey said he wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade.
He's going to spend a lot of money here and his chances of winning are very slight.

"Look, Wolf, this election could very well be decided by which candidate better articulates an economic message."
This sound check is one to remember.
And it's an area that I think is up for grabs right now.
"All I heard from Donald Trump was more angry vilification of immigrants, more goofy conspiracy theories about nine-month abortions and eating your neighbor's cat and those aren't policy proposals and I really was looking for something like that."
Hopefully that doesn't bother you too much.
"And obviously my wife, Michelle, was one of those people."

"Well, thank you."
Something's wrong.
"Sentencing for Hunter Biden's own conviction in Delaware is set for November 13, where he could face up to 25 years in prison, though a lighter sentence is likely for the first-time offender."

You might even say Northampton County could even be like a bellwether of the entire country.
He very well can crack 20% of the vote in Philadelphia.
"Since Harris became the presumptive nominee, another campaign official said more than 20,000 new volunteers have signed up."
"So again, that's a state where you're gonna see the Harris campaign put a lot of effort into playing defense."
Kisses.

"If I was charged in the way Jenna Ellis was, I'd probably be the very first one to roll in on a proper agreement and cut a deal because professionals, lawyers like Jenna Ellis have more to lose than say a hardened criminal who's looking at his third conviction."

"So that's coming either way, even if it's not a great time in the news cycle for it."

"A recent Emerson College poll from October 1, 2024, had both candidates at 48 percent, while a Bloomberg-Sawanar Morning Consult poll found Harris ahead by 5 points."

And that's why you gotta vote.

"And this source, it really emphasizes how much economic concerns are on voters' minds these days."
"Shifting our focus to Arizona, another pivotal state, we observe similar competitive dynamics."
"So with each passing day just like North Carolina, it's trending Republican."

What they find is that Bob Casey's up double digits.
"Well, against Biden, Trump led by 2.9%."
I got you sir.

"Look, this is still super close."
"What do you think of Russell Wilson, by the way?"
There are snipers on the tops of roofs.

Now these counties here will report in earlier than Philadelphia because there are fewer people here than there are in Philadelphia and the thing to note is of all of these votes here in Allegheny in 2020 almost 65% of them went for Biden in this whole section here including Philadelphia it was about 66% of all the votes from this area went for Biden but in Philadelphia which is included in this number of the 66% but if you take this out and just look at Philadelphia 80% of the votes coming out of Philadelphia went to Biden and so when you look at 43% of all of the votes cast in Pennsylvania are coming from these two areas and that roughly 65% of all of those votes went to Biden it means that the state goes to the Democrat it's just the way that the numbers work out especially if there is a significant increase in the number of people voting in this area especially in Philadelphia and also over here in Allegheny which we expect to have happened in this election so come November when you're watching the election returns you are going to relax take a deep breath get out your popcorn and whatever adult beverages you might be consuming that night and you will just sit and watch the returns coming in from Pennsylvania and you will not care what is happening for the whole state of Pennsylvania until the Philadelphia metropolitan area starts reporting in and Allegheny County because between those two areas that is 40 it's going to be 43% of the vote and in fact I would say with the increase in voter participation for this particular election it could be anywhere from 45 46 48 percent of the entire vote coming out of those two areas and because the majority of the voters are voting for the Democrat this is why I predict Kamala Harris is taking Pennsylvania in this election it's just about the math
Pretty important this debate tonight.
A Pennsylvania Democratic strategist said that Liu empowers a culture in the campaign that has left officials feeling unengaged and disrespected.

Janelle Stelson is an awesome candidate.
There's no way he wins Pennsylvania by two to three.
I don't even know this Oliver person is.

"And get this, their data right now showing a slight lean toward Republicans."
We're using the Democrat strategy of mailing with the Amish.
"But Ruben and I were talking to a remarkable group of men right before we came out, and we were talking about this, and somebody said, I'm just so tired of everybody being divided and mean and nasty."
So Republicans have to decide who do they serve Donald Trump with American people.
"And that is a fascinating point you just made, this nervousness about turnout, because when Kamala Harris, the vice president, became the nominee to be, then became the nominee officially at the Democratic National Convention, all through that period of time, July, August, early September, one of the biggest words you heard associated with that campaign was enthusiasm."
Are you going to vote Republican?
While Trump was on stage at a rally in Pennsylvania a sniper from some distance attempted to assassinate him.

Was he wounded?
"Now, some people, because I'm having conversations around the country with folks as I go campaigning, and I'll hear some people say, well, I remember the economy when those first two years with Trump, they were pretty good."
Getting shot almost shot at twice.
"Well, on that question in particular, and you're right, I think Americans want pragmatic solutions to real problems."
"I mean, this is a state that back in 2016 and 2020, the polls were garbage."
She has tied.
It's gone.
In this economy.
"And I say, yeah, yeah, it was good, because it was my economy that I gave to them."

Are you seeing across the country some of the Republicans who are supportive of abortion rights being a little bit wary of Trump who nominated people to the Supreme Court who overturned Roe v. Wade?

"Now, she is from California."
"You got a convention in about 10 days, debate September 10th."
"Frankly, I'm going to say this in all sincerity."
I love Philly and Pittsburgh and they're an incredibly important part of our Commonwealth.
My name is Kimberly Clark-Baskin and I am the City Clerk for the City Council of the City of Pittsburgh and I am also a proud resident of the Homewood community.
"She silently inspires so many black and brown children, young adults, and adults to keep pushing and pursuing their goals by showing her strength and consistency to break all glass ceilings placed above her."
Take a listen.
But I don't want to settle for a grifter.
And I certainly think they should.
Love that dude.
And I think my polling that we put out the Trump tied in Pennsylvania is to left because of the sample and the internal demographics.
"So for that being said, let's get it."
"Charlotte Morgan â€“ $5 million Charlotte Morgan, a writer, has been working a retail magnate, has contributed $5 million to Kamala Harris' campaign."
Biden navigated to the center of the Democratic Party.
Why not cop a red wave t-shirt from readygopolitics.com?
"Because this entire thing around the Veebs stakes and Josh Shapiro being the VP nominee, was that Democrats were worried that they couldn't win Pennsylvania in 2024 without Josh Shapiro."
Amisha Kamala Harris will follow Trump to North Carolina on Friday.
The former president has been shocked.
"Now, I think it's true that there's a lot of hardening of the lines in support of Donald Trump or Kamala Harris."
"And the more informed we are, the better choices we can make."
"It was the first time I'm like, I'm happy I don't live in a swing state, because I don't think I could handle this, because even if you don't want to engage with it and you don't watch terrestrial TV, it's on the radio, the yard signs are everywhere."
 Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are each holding their first big events today since Tuesday night's fiery debate.
"We had a meeting this morning, very productive meeting."
That's right.
But it's a tough thing to do.
"So if it wasn't for a single pollster, which Bloomberg has done this like five times the cycle, every time there's a stretch of bad polling out of the blue, Bloomberg releases a Harris plus five in Pennsylvania, Harris plus 12 in Michigan, it's a pile of crap."
" So Governor, appropriately, the Spilly suburbs and city of Philadelphia gets a lot of attention and a lot of people talk about the T, which is, let's just call it, for lack of a better term, we know what it is, but it's not a center in northern part of the state."
"But Trump's support base is still strong in Pennsylvania's rural counties, and it's this electorate that will likely make the difference come election day."
It's political poison.
"You know, I'm still the same person I was before I put that information out."
The Harris team is calling this the New Way Forward Tour.
So we're not sure if any of these things are gonna move the metric really.
"Between now and election day, the narrative is going to be that she's loser on top of the strikes on top of now, the federal emergency management efforts in North Carolina."
"As Barack Obama put on a stern fatherly act, he asked black men to learn from black women, whom the former President claims are against Donald Trump."
He spoke fast.
So you kind of can't compete.
And are you going to have to say the vice president asked me to deliver this message?
" Former President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail with a fiery rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, reigniting his base with his signature rhetoric and promises."
Nothing else comes close.
A little tiny shift in Philadelphia in terms of raw vote percentages and turnout is more than enough to flip the state.
"But instead, you see new Republicans and these new registrations."
What we say and the messages we send have an impact in the real world.
You confessed.
Nnedi Cavazos for us reporting from Washington this morning.
"Underway, as we speak right now in Pennsylvania, you're taking a live look at Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer."
"He was up 4% on this day, September 19th in 2020, and Hillary Clinton was up 6.6 points in 2016."
The credit belongs to them.
"Which seems like, doesn't seem like a great strategy."
We know exactly what he represents and what he would bring in the second term.
"So again, quite a difference."
The reason they did that was because that's the purest form of propaganda.
So it has made it ground zero For these two candidates and it's like they say that no matter who loses Pennsylvania that candidate has much less of a chance of prevailing nationally Wow In 2016 you wrote that quote Trump's dissing of democracy will live in infamy and that he was a clear and present Danger to our Democratic values What specifically did you observe about Trump eight years ago that led you to make his claim far before January 6th?
"Trump can win the election without even knowing if he won Pennsylvania, if he wins some other important states."
"You don't want to be up by three and on top of that insider advantage, which is a good pollster."
One thing Republicans have to stop.
"It's not just, you know, oh, he's down by a point."
"If you deport to these people, who would do that job and what price would we pay for food?"
This is not just a hanging out at the county fairgrounds.
We're an energy producing state.
"But former President Trump has his own issues in Pennsylvania, the suburbs."
He's stumbling over his words.
"But there's got to be, there's got to be culture built by us that can still be creative, can still espouse values of freedom without encouraging kids to do drugs or be worse versions of themselves."
"Yeah, I think that's going to be a central question of this election because we've seen across the country since the overturning of Roe every time an abortion measure was on the ballot it has passed."
I can't even get it out.
The Pennsylvania ruling reinforces Trump's campaign's argument that there are vulnerabilities in the electoral system that need to be addressed.
"This election, Kamala Harris and Erie, Pennsylvania at this hour, making her case on the economy, arguing her policies will help middle class families reaching out to black voters."
We'll go with that.
"Yeah, you know, it's hard to say."
You could say that some of these polls here have registered these two polls that showed Kamala Harris out of the margin of error for her victory.
"Lieutenant Governor Davis, thank you for welcoming us to this great state of Pennsylvania."
"John Fetterman, if you remember at that time, barely even put a code in his sentence."
So that gap closing.
This narrative can be used to challenge the Democratic position and appeal to voters who are worried about potential vulnerabilities in the voting system.
And so that also continues to reaffirm that Kamala Harris is in fact in the lead in Pennsylvania.
"So it's important, but it hasn't really moved at all."
I don't want to hear made up stories.
I've seen you skateboard.
"Now, I want to go over why this is a big deal that Harris is potentially in deep trouble in Pennsylvania."
Obama is a Muslim.
"Remember, Jesse Jackson was the second highest vote getter in 88."
"And so you go in Allentown, Bethlehem, Easton, the Northeast part of the state."
And we're live with the one and only Tim Poole.
And that's not exactly something that's all that solid.
We've seen a lot of support from the Republican party for our cookies.
"All right, guys, back to the video."
What do you chalk it up to?
"As you all know, Vice President Kamala Harris has been a huge advocate for the communities across the country to have clean and lead-free drinking water, getting lead pipes removed and replaced, and the remediation of lead paint that still exists in so many homes and nationwide."
Trump you better you better keep your head low you better keep your head low that was probably the first war.
"This is about as significant because ever since the debate, President Biden has sharply declining in Pennsylvania and Donald Trump has been inclining."
"And in terms of turnout, Donald Trump, you got to get that turnout operation going."
"No, I don't think surprised would be a word I would use for that."
"Let's find out what stories our North America bureau is pursuing right now from our bureau chief, TJ Manotok."
They're signing shells to bomb Russia from the United States made in America.
"Yeah, that's malignant narcissism right there."
"Winning by like kind of resetting the narrative around these particular this particular set of, you know, issue sets."
Trumpy Trout understands.
I consider myself to be a productive member of society.
"And it's causing, you know, these extreme actions."
" Alright everyone, we have to talk about some political polling right now."
So this could be a down ballot situation.
Seventh grade geography.
This is a purple state.
"So, Lindsay, anyone from Pennsylvania will tell you that the eastern part of the state is more east coast, more mid-Atlantic."
You may remember debated Harris back during 2019 Democratic primary season.
"And let me ask you one last question, Libby."
The impression that I get is my Song of the Day.
And this is the first time that I've ever seen a Trump surrogates.
"Look, you're the national political reporter for the Washington Post."
"They gained roughly 5,000 on net this week, which is huge."
"I said, let's calm down."
Do you think inflation maybe has a little bit to do with the record high stock market?
I approve my governor.
But of course here a lot of support among Pennsylvania Democrats for Harris to choose Shapiro.
"And it makes sense if you're supporting the interests of the health insurance industry, right?"
"He's a whole human being, but if you believe that Joe Biden hates Kamala Harris comment, yes, or well, you remember like, no, we, we reported this like before the official switch, there were reports that like Kamala and him and their, their administrations were just at each other's throats."
So what does it tell us?
And I think that's going to be on full display on Tuesday.
So I'm here helping engage the Amish with Dr. Oz and master Reno.
This can help reinforce his campaign's message and create a favorable contrast with Democratic positions on election integrity.
They went for Donald Trump in 2016.
"30, 30%."
Yes!
"However, the real contest is in the battleground states where Harris and Trump are in a tight contest."
But they add up.
"We've gotten new data over the past few days in terms of the recent two polls, but the recent Bloomberg poll trumps up by six."
And that's going to do it for the morning agenda.
"And after that, he never ended up taking questions again to the former president."
"If you're Harris, you want to be up by two to three points on average, not up by point five, because you are one point away from losing Pennsylvania and more than likely losing the presidency."
More hands for those of you who thought this debate could be determinative How many of you have made up your minds based on what you saw tonight on stage in Philadelphia raise your hands All right.
So shout out to the song.
"And I cannot also ignore the fact that Tim Walz being added onto the ticket has done phenomenally, found a phenomenal thanks for Kamala Harris's campaign."
"And just recently, Republicans have edged out Democrats by two hundred and seventy seven voters."
"Not just because of one pollster having Harris plus four because if you're up by only one, hell, you're not even up by a point, you're still tied."
That's the picture.
"Yeah, so I mean, after 2016, Trump really starts to lose the suburban vote, especially the suburban women vote."
"In swing Northampton County, Pennsylvania, Democratic volunteers meet weekly to strategize, before hitting the streets and pushing every way they can for Harris."
But just him as a person.
So it's not just about having the right people.
It depends on us.
And the name calling and the nastiness does not help Donald Trump.
"Thank you so much for joining us, Congressman."
"I mean, you guys can update me if you want."
And that is what I think you're seeing throughout this country.
Of course he did.
"And I found that that for the most part, if you're not talking to Hannity, if you're not talking to, again, Ingraham, in some cases, it's going to be fair."
"These urban areas have traditionally been Democratic strongholds, but the state's rural and small-town voters have increasingly turned to the Republican party in recent years' point one of the key factors driving Ohio's shift toward the Republicans has been the realignment of working-class white voters."
"In contrast to what he considers to be the failure of the Republican Party to protect basic freedoms in their current form, he highlighted marriage equality, religious freedom, and union rights and public safety as areas in which Democrats have been defending fundamental liberties."
"And the reason for that, sure, can be fair."
I had friends who disagreed with me on every issue.
"So I can understand, you know, maybe you want the right person to do that."
"Social media is playing a huge role in this election, with both campaigns using it to reach a broader audience."
Have a great rest of your day.
"If you're a Republican, there would have to be a crazy deviation that we haven't seen in over two decades for it to signal a Harris victory because if she wins the popular vote by a point, she's not winning the electoral college even with the recent shifts we're going to that we've seen in New York and possibly Illinois and California and Florida and all of those states are getting more conservative."
This is horrible.
I am not sure why it isn't.
All of them girls from the V.O.
So you heard so you heard his words.
"So in store, they are pleasant."
So let's dive into this Trump endorsed Dr. Oz in the Senate race.
"First, the size of the state."
But what's the excuse for Quinnipiac or even The New York Times?
They wouldn't save anything because you would think that'd be the last time Trump would run.
They're saying those policies helped their families.
"I said, he's a pretty strong guy, right?"
This is the Doug Tenapl Channel.
It is nonstop.
"You know, Senator, I thought when you were talking about what most people are concerned about, I thought you were going to say whether or not it was a sketch artist that drew Vice President Kamala Harris on the front page of the Time magazine cover, because that seems to be the Republicans biggest."
"I should make sure to note here though that both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden led Trump in the final polling averages headed into the 2016 and 2020 elections, before ultimately losing the state to Trump on both occasions."
"Next, we have a poll from Muhlenberg College conducted between September 16th and 19th."
"Kids don't want to work, you know?"
"This is just fantastic, no other way around that."
The results that they're saying that you can't there you can't put any more people in.
They're evil.
And we're not necessarily favoring his policies or his personality per se.
He's doing great in early voting.
"So my guess is, and it's an educated guess, this will be the one place you will see him on the ground for Kamala Harris."
"The results were astounding, and we began to get answers to some unanswered health issues."
"The governor, former governor of New Mexico."
"He's pissing off a lot of his fellow liberals, but he's not with 538, didn't really make that forecast."
So this is really big stuff and it's good.
Do you think that it's time for her to sit down for an interview and explain that decision to change course on some of these issues and take some tough questions from members of the media?
"And I think what people will end up remembering about Joe Biden is the fact that his family, his staff, every Democrat in Congress, most of the people up here on this stage, of course, not you, but they covered for his what was very great cognitive decline."
"If you warn your own MAGA audience, then you're not doing it right."
I may vote with third party.
This was after an abysmal debate performance.
I really don't care.
The state's voters know their ballots carry immense weight.
"And in part, that's why you've seen Vice President Harris here in downtown Pittsburgh since last Thursday preparing for the debate."
"To the point of the third parties that you mentioned, a recent Reuters poll showed that 40 percent of Arab and Muslim voters in Michigan are now backing the Green Party candidate Jill Stein."
So that's good.
" Hello everyone, today I'm back with some surprising poll results that show just how tight the presidential race between the two candidates is."
"The Harris Biden administration, let's be honest, befuddled old Joe hasn't been in charge of anything for quite some time now, has been as hostile to the energy sector more than any presidential administration since, well, Barack Obama."
Any any recommendations for for me as I head to fantasy draft this weekend?
"I guess that's a majority, but do you really think that every new voter Republicans are gaining?"
It could be could be completely wrong.
Kamala Harris received 50% of the vote and Donald Trump 44%.
Don't just quote what the news tells you man.
And she herself has been out knocking on every door.
You could not make this stuff up.
Fracking is a big industry in a number of states.
It's like it's like a whole mindset thing.
I really do.
One last question before we go.
"Well, it is a very polarized society right now."
And then we saw what happened when pushback from McConnell McCarthy and other so-called Republican leaders came in.
"But look though, I mean, Kamala or Biden is the same thing."
"I didn't feel we had any good choices, and I'm still not sure we do."
You look weird doing that.
The former president has been moved off-site.
And I feel like that's important.
We won Pennsylvania twice.
So thank you for joining my channel.
This is how we change the world.
"Now, some people, because I'm having conversations around the country with folks as I go campaigning, and I'll hear some people say, you know, well, I remember the economy when those first two years with Trump, they were pretty good."
And it worked.
"Now I should mention, Donald Trump recently posted on Truth Social."
"I generally just do not think that Mr. Trump could, uh, could lead the country at all."
"And isn't it, I don't know what the right word is, but like the two guys that shot at Trump was what?"
"But you cannot tell me with a straight face that Republicans have been gaining so many new voters in PA that all of them, not just a few of them, but every single voter they've gained, they're just ancestral Democrats."
"And sure, it recovered to something more reasonable."
"Well, Harris is certainly using this issue."
And so that's what we got to look at.
"He has worked to prevent women from making their own health care decisions and threaten your fundamental freedoms and rights like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride."
"Listen, when the Republican Party decided to move away from the party of Reagan and Bush and Romney, by the way, people I had major differences with and instead adopt Trumpism, they gave up on any claim toward family values."
"But first, CBS News political reporter, Aaron Navarro streams with us from Pittsburgh."
" And Please welcome Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Michael Regan."
"When they hear him make those promises again, they kind of know their BS and they kind of know that it's empty."
"Wisconsin for one, I mentioned Harris will be there this week visiting her supporters."
"It was very contentious, but it was a state that Republicans had focused on."
If I can get in just to see Trump.
"Tucson, we do not need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails."
"But beyond that point, there wasn't much else that Donald Trump could really uplift."
Alvarez captures the haunted house in space vibe from Alien and the action-packed sci-fi adventure of Aliens.
"Can't do that yet, even though they're trying hard to do that."
His eclipse glasses will have a little chain on them.
"She's worked on some big campaigns, right?"
"And so when we look at this race, it's just it's it's just incredibly close."
"I think that if there's a tie in Pennsylvania, like in the statistical polling, I think that Trump will win."
"They're off by three points, which is very possible, considering you have garbage pollsters like Bloomberg finding Harris plus five."
So there's a lot to really look forward to in regards to this election.
Donald Trump created all of these voters.
"His brother this week, we're not good when he says John Deere, we're going to tariff you 200 percent just because it's 75 percent of manufacturing in America."
"Okay, Lindsay, you're in sales You're the person who wasn't sure she was gonna vote for anybody because you don't like either these two candidates I'll ask you more about that in a minute."
We've got a rally coming up with Doug Bastiano and that's going to be with the Amish in the midnight.
What is up with?
He's not with the status quo.
I'm talking about if I were trying to advise her and let's go talk about abortion more.
"Let's say Wisconsin goes to Kamala Harris, then you take away Pennsylvania."
And what's the issue with her?
Didn't we have a Rafa red line at one point?
A Pennsylvania Democratic strategist said that Lew empowers a culture in the campaign that has left officials feeling unengaged and disrespected.
It was a moment of solidarity and shared purpose.
"Demanding and saying look it does not require a scientist or a doctor to understand the impacts of lead pipes on the health of our children and the voices of the community must be heard and let us also acknowledge that while lead pipes were once standard in all communities today not all communities are impacted in the same way because of course the folks who have extra resources maybe they have equity in their home and they're a homeowner right maybe they have money in the bank account maybe some savings well then they can pay to replace the lead pipes in their home but people in low-income communities or people who rent often cannot and the president and I understand that this is yes it is an infrastructure matter but it is also a public health matter it is also a public health matter and one of the essential functions of government is to concern itself with the public health which is why President Biden and I decided that we need to address this issue understanding the public health crisis it can create and then making sure that all people have access to what they need to be healthy regardless of how much money they have in their back pocket so we have invested billions of dollars to remove every lead pipe in our nation including right here in Pittsburgh and today I am proud to announce that President Biden and I are dedicating 5.8 billion in federal dollars to help remove lead pipes and to fund clean water projects across our country which includes more than 200 million dollars for Pennsylvania and I will tell you yes and as you heard I was in Pittsburgh not very long ago and when I was last year to speak with members of this community impacted by lead pipes since that has happened or since that meeting we have now made investments that have resulted in this city being able to replace more than three thousand lead pipes to the benefit of more than 10,000 people and you are well on your way to replacing every lead pipe here in the next 24 months so today's additional investment will help accelerate that work and it will also help upgrade other water infrastructure so here's the deal in Pennsylvania many water mains that deliver water to a street or a neighborhood are over 100 years old so old water mains are more likely to break or bust especially when the temperatures drop just a few weeks ago in the hill district a water main burst and hundreds of people lost water for a full day the 200 million dollars now coming to pennsylvania can be used to replace old water mains across the state and also could be used to upgrade storm drains and prevent floods during the heavy rains like the floods that you saw in downtown Pittsburgh just a few weeks ago so when president Biden and I talk about why we do what we do it is to deliver in a way that is about real results for real people it's about understanding the constraints and the burdens that families face that working people face for some basic things like having access to clean water and what we know we can do together to actually fix these long-standing problems and in addition part of the beauty of what we have all done together is these investments will create jobs good paying union jobs jobs for plumbers and pipe fitters and laborers jobs for the workers of plumbers local 27 here in Pittsburgh and it comes down to this in the United States of America every person should be able to have clean water I shouldn't have to say that but it does come down to that every person should have a right and the ability to have access to clean water and it should not matter where you live or how much money you earn or how much money you got in your back pocket and with the help of all of the leaders here we are building a future then where clean water will be a reality for all and I thank you all for the work you do every day may God bless you and may God bless the United States of America thank you"
"If you talk about it, oh, it's a conspiracy."
And our ABC News Ipsos polling shows a big 17 point gender gap with Trump leading among men with eight points and Harris leading among women with nine points.
"Kind of everybody just kind of say what you want to hear, so to me it's just really hard because it's what they really do when they're elected."
The 90 minute debate will have no studio audience.
"Recent polling data suggests that Trump is currently favored in several key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Georgia."
And I think it's obviously just a larger problem with the way the media just expects the worst from him.
Some of these House races you name it and they were able to kind of make Mike Braun underperform and make Donald Trump underperform as well.
"Joining me now is Stacey Abrams, voting rights activist and former Democratic leader of the Georgia House, who I know is watching that rally as well."
"The farmers are doing very badly right now, very, very badly under this administration."
The polls ended up being nearly entirely accurate.
But I really do believe that there are people who are not wedded to one candidate or the other firmly here in Pennsylvania.
I mean the only thing that he didn't do is steal the election for Trump.
So this is where we should wrap it because that's it is a good point about as you're interpreting and we'll be interpreting primary results over the course of the cycle.
"And while a four point lead in Pennsylvania was absolutely phenomenal news for the Democratic Party, it had to be substantiated and pretty much reaffirmed by some consistency in data points."
"There's a lot of good things happening, but a lot more work to do."
Trump is on track.
"Like, have they recalibrated polls?"
We don't let anybody just walk through our homes.
"We could do another question or two if you'd like, but probably do you want to do one?"
That is the fact of the matter.
And yet they feel as though they have had a strong recovery.
"This particular case was used by Shapiro to draw attention to a more general problem, which is the disparity between collecting endorsements from an organization and engaging with individual members in a genuine manner."
"So yeah, they're saying that Trump looks forward to attend the Republican convention that they're having."
That's why Trump's got to keep bringing it up.
New York Times back then they had Joe Biden leading by six percentage points.
This is something only Henson can offer because of their precision manufacturing shop that also makes aerospace parts.
The inquiry is reporting that Republican VP nominee J.
"What can you tell us about the debate, what we should expect to be watching most closely when he debates tonight?"
"I was like no, we like Shapiro, we really want him here."
Let me ask you about a specific issue that I know is important to your voters in Western Pennsylvania.
It is.
"To your point, yes, I am running to be a president for all American."
"We do not want to hand him the keys back to the White House where he can continue to try and divide us, offend people, and spew more hatred and bigotry in our society."
"Absolutely, of course."
"And yet in this case, Trump is still tied."
" Ladies and gentlemen, American German Bulldog Nation, welcome to the Eric Dieter Show."
I did think I thought Kate Gallego was kind of a standout in those intros.
Because I watched the votes at the end.
"Once you get into there outside of these big cities, they add up pretty quickly."
Markets that call for Democrats to take the presidency and at least one house of Congress have all seen gains.
It's a very important state for him in November.
Beanies.
"Like I'm not saying by 10 points, but compared to like 2020 and 2016, he might win it by two to three points."
"After Democrats and journalists have spent the entire election cycle claiming that crime is down, the FBI, three weeks before an election, revises the crime statistics, showing the crime increased by 4.5% in 2022 instead of dropping by 2%."
It didn't happen.
"So given that, the society is also divided right from the middle."
"Our top story tonight involves a tense exchange at the White House earlier today, where White House correspondent Peter Ducey questioned press secretary Kareen Jean-Pierre about Vice President Kamala Harris's shifting policy positions."
So she's been in Pennsylvania for a couple of years at least.
"We know, you know, one thing I was just reading that the Latino vote, which I'm always following so closely, is really favoring Ron DeSantis."
"The first question came from ABC's Scott, who asked about Trump's past incendiary rhetoric towards women of color."
"And then something that doesn't get a lot of attention is the fact that the federal government is spending America into bankruptcy, which is crazy."
Donald Trump would break 50% in Pennsylvania.
We'll continue that trip planning ahead of the presidential election.
There's no way around it.
"In a place like this, they have lost jobs."
But it will be interesting to see if that generates any chatter in the coming days and weeks.
Where are we in 10 million as of a few weeks ago?
I don't think shooting is okay.
"This morning, the Cook Political Report moved three battleground states that are key, Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada, from lean Republican to toss-up, citing increased Democratic energy and unity around Kamala Harris."
It's a whole different story for Pennsylvania.
She's tough.
Carol.
In 2020.
"Because when you own a home, that's when if your child says, daddy, I wanna go to college, you can say, sweetheart, don't have to take out a loan, I'll take some equity out of the house."
 It's a sprint to the finish line for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump.
"And one of them, and this is where the vice president is going on her way right now, is Luzerne County."
But do you understand that that's detached from goddamn reality?
"And to help stave off a shortage of blood at the height of summer heat and travel, the American Red Cross is imploring people to donate."
And so you have folks that are business owners and are more attracted to Trump.
"It's of course not about me, but I do grow up here."
"However, Trump's having difficulty sticking to that message."
"â€”On the other side, you have someone who has consistently shown disregard, not just for the communities, but for you as a person."
"Yeah, John, that's the way to phrase it to the American people."
So with the latest polls we've seen and the average and the averages that we've seen we've seen a slight downtick in the national picture for Harris International lead since the peak that we've seen back in September.
Explain that to our viewers.
How is President Trump going to deliver?
"More fundraising ever, more money ever, more resources at the disposal of the Democratic ticket and a honed in electoral strategy that is far narrower than the 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020 campaigns of what was 10 plus swing states have now been reduced down to seven."
"And Sagar, I know you spent some time in the state."
"Like, maybe this is just misinformation, whatever."
"Probably another right in this November, but the 2016 result still stinks."
We'll leave no doubt about who we are and what America stands for.
"Whatever you do, you have to vote and make sure your ballot counts."
There's a Trump sign.
How is the Harris campaign kind of working to close the gap on some of these key issues?

What role does Pennsylvania play in Kamala Harris' presidential campaign?

"And it's not because I love the man, but I like his policies a lot better."
"To your point today, her campaign rolled out a brand new policy plan that really focuses on this voting bloc, announcing 1 million forgivable small loans, announcing an effort to try to legalize marijuana, they say, to boost that industry, which would create more jobs and a health initiative to focus on things that disproportionately affect black men like sickle cell disease."

He is.
But I've had a great partnership with the Biden-Harris administration that's allowed me to do so much of this work.
And we saw it with your own eyes.
The next few months will be crucial for Harris as she works to build momentum and gain the trust of undecided voters.
"I mean, if we all collectively had a dollar for every time we talk to someone that said, you know, I don't like the way he speaks, but you know, I'm not voting for him because I think he's a great person."

What do you think is happening in Wisconsin with Catholic voters if if Notre Dame shifted this Republican in just four years?

The dynamics are very different on the ground than they were then.
She touched on a fe abortion a little bit on about uplifting Native Am That's something that Ste governor of the Gila Riv spoken support of and thr behind Harris.
So I think you'd see a second Trump term without as much chaos and without as much groping for what America first policy really means.
The focus on Pennsylvania isn't just about rallies.
It's just trash for your pleasure.
Harris finished 5 points ahead of Trump in this poll.
So this is a key state for Donald Trump to win.

"No other country has as low inflation as the United States does right now, and we're expecting rate cuts from the Fed in September later this month."
"If I'm Trump, I'm in Pennsylvania every freaking, I mean, I can't be there every day."

I mean there are a lot of women out there who are who are you know put off by Trump's personality or are concerned about abortion.
U I'm still tired.
"So to all the other leaders who are also here – the parents, the grandparents, the advocates, the teachers, the community leaders – I thank you for the work you have done over so many years to make sure that this community, and by extension as a role model – many communities around our country – that they have access to, as Michael Regan said, one of the most basic and essential resources, which is clean water."
"Nate Silver calling out Alan Lichtman, actually."
To see Trump would fill you with joy.
"Dave, I've been in your your great Commonwealth now two weeks in a row."
"Yeah, the president is going to be in Pennsylvania for three days."
There was a lot of weird things happening.
He loves this country.
Now we have a new poll from the New York Times with Sienna College this is an A plus rated pollster apparently the best the best even though their polls are all over the place that this election season but they show Kamala Harris with a four point lead when you don't round out the results over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania when you round these are the numbers that they give us it is 50% for Kamala Harris 47% for Donald Trump a three point lead when rounded when you unround Trump falls down to 46% which gives her a very impressive four point lead in Pennsylvania and you will look at why this four point lead is so important not to mention Arizona of course while we have this poll up Donald Trump really expanding his lead in Arizona to now a 6% margin very impressive for him but we you know we really have had this common consensus now for quite a while now for months now that Donald Trump will carry the state of Arizona as well as other Sun Belt states but Pennsylvania is the important one here Arizona only has 11 electoral votes Pennsylvania has 19 in such a close race like this that eight more from Pennsylvania sorry yeah eight more on that really does matter a lot so that four point lead is important because we always talk about you know how much are the polls overestimated Joe Biden in the 2020 election right because when you look at 2020 he was expected to win by only four point seven percent and I say only because take that with with a state like Wisconsin in 2020 where Joe Biden was expected to win in the polls on election day by eight point four percent he only won it by point six so he was overestimated basically eight percent almost in the state of Wisconsin while you head over to Pennsylvania again he was expected to win by four point seven he won it by one point two so he was only over estimated here by some three and a half percent so to see Kamala Harris with the four point lead on rounded in Pennsylvania that's big because I do want to preface this with saying that I don't think that Kamala Harris will be overestimated in the polls at all I currently think that she will be underestimated in the polling so even if she is overestimated as much as Joe Biden was in the 2020 election in Pennsylvania she still wins again Biden was overestimated by three and a half percent in Pennsylvania when you do the math Harris has a four point lead currently she would still win the state by a very narrow margin so Pennsylvania is hugely important right you know so that was just to show you know how important this single poll is considering that it isn't a plus pollster but now we have to talk about Pennsylvania because the fact that the fact the matter is she is running away with Pennsylvania it's a very narrow lead um in in of court like the average I'm in the aggregate of polls um which is expected and again I don't I do think that Harris will outpace what polls are expecting I really do because poll stars are pollsters are worried about underestimating the Trump factor once again and everything like that so they are really boosting Trump's are they're giving an emphasis on Trump areas because they're you know the polling industry is you know going down right now in the dumps um so again they're really trying to get it accurate this time not underestimate Trump ultimately I think that Harris is being underestimated now just like 2022 the Democrats were but when it comes to the average you can see Harris has never let up once in the state of Pennsylvania that's insane that is absolutely insane Harris has kept a lead in Pennsylvania this entire race now let's compare that to a state like North Carolina for a moment we see we see um in the beginning of the race Trump had a pretty steady lead then Harris took the lead for a moment there for literally like two days then he was even then Trump took the back the lead then it was even again Trump took the lead Harris took the lead by point to Trump took the lead Harris took the lead Trump took the lead again Harris took the lead Trump took the lead and he still has the lead less than 1% this is the case and this is the most extreme case but this is a case that's going that's happening with many many many battleground states Michigan not Michigan sorry Wisconsin Nevada especially Arizona Georgia for sure but what you notice is that it's not happening in Pennsylvania and that's important the fact that there is a common consensus in the polling numbers is important fact that common layers is a clear leader is a clear favorite to win in Pennsylvania that's important let's just take a look at at the 538 forecast here let's I don't know what they are currently projected to be honest um they say that the presidential race is extremely narrow but I assume they say of course that Harris is favored to win in Pennsylvania you can see there she has a 52 to 48 percent chance of winning the state but looking at Pennsylvania specifically again it is so incredibly important that Kamala Harris does have a lock on Pennsylvania that's what I've been saying for a while when you look at the electoral map Pennsylvania proves to be extremely important this is my forecast that's the map these are all the numbers this is how I think that the election will go if it were held today or tomorrow or whatever so Pennsylvania is critical obviously to Kamala Harris on now if Trump does win Pennsylvania Kamala Harris actually still wins the election however she then has literally zero wiggle room the only place that she could lose is Nebraska second district resulting in her still winning the election even if she loses just Nevada on top of that you know just two slight changes in my forecast then she loses the election 267 to 271 however however North Carolina is basically toss-up I have a Harris plus 0.1 percent because I don't know it's too hard to tell there are too many factors Mark Robinson being on the ballot the state shifting left rapidly right now there are so many factors to consider North Carolina it's virtually toss-up I think that Harris wins by honestly a few thousand votes so look I would not be surprised in the slightest if Trump wins North Carolina because the odds really are 50-50 in my forecast right now considering that margin of Harris plus 0.1 so if North Carolina does go red which you say I'm on a chance that it goes red as it goes blue then she can't lose Pennsylvania then she has to hold Pennsylvania so the fact that she as I outlined she is you know she has this sort of lock on Pennsylvania right now as she has had throughout this race that's important because it is critical to her path to victory then if she holds Pennsylvania she could even lose Nevada Nevada could even go to Donald Trump and it could still result in a 270 win for Harrison walls 270 is the minimum you need to win the presidency that is just two electoral votes up against Trump and Vance so North Carolina and Nevada could easily go Republican but as long as she has Pennsylvania she wins the election and she holds the other blue wall states now what if Trump wins Pennsylvania it's you know obviously it's important to Harris's victory but if Trump is going to win the election of course I really think that you know he might need Pennsylvania however that he doesn't need it he could he could simply just run the Sun Belt North Carolina Georgia Arizona Nevada and then flip Wisconsin I think that Wisconsin will be closer than Pennsylvania so that of course can absolutely happen but if Pennsylvania does go red it really opens the door for Donald Trump if he wins the Sun Belt plus Pennsylvania he's at 287 17 more than he needs then he could even lose North Carolina and he still wins the election or he could actually lose he could even lose Nevada and Arizona and he still wins the election 270 to 268 so you know Pennsylvania everything weighs on Pennsylvania almost Donald Trump and Kamala Harris still paths to victory especially Trump Trump still has a path to victory without Pennsylvania however Pennsylvania is one of the most likely states to go to either candidate because of how split it is right now so it's very good for Kamala Harris when she gets polls like this which shows her from an A plus pollster with a pretty steady lead in the most critical battleground state Pennsylvania and again I think that she will win it Joe Biden won it by 1.2% in 2020 and what we have seen is a massive left-word trend in the suburbs the suburbs that dominate Pennsylvania elections and we are seeing massive left-ward trends across suburbs or in suburbs across the nation so if Pennsylvania can continue to trend to the left then the Democrats are in for a really good result in Pennsylvania so look at this Chester County Pennsylvania vote for Mitt Romney in 2012 by 0.2% he lost the state Obama won the state by 5% fast forward four years later Chester County went from 0.2 for Romney to 10 for Hillary Clinton now Donald Trump won the state so while the state as a whole trended seven points or six points I should say towards the Republicans Chester County became ten points more Democratic that you never see furthermore he went from ten points in 2016 to a stunning 17 points for Biden in 2020 suburbs eight Donald Trump and I believe that now more than ever with someone like Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket for the Democrats she will be able to really continue this trend possibly you know trend it more these at least Chester County trend it more towards the Democrats than we have seen in past elections in 2016 and 2020 so that's the state of the race right now in Pennsylvania hugely important state Kamala Harris definitely favored to win so thank you all

Not not over Israel but mostly just over the same thing that hit Nina Turner over which is that she's not a good enough Democrat.
And this is their makeshift jobs.
"In 2016, he only got 45.9% of the popular voters, somewhere in that range."
Where was Scott Perry?
"I mean, elections should be not something to dread."
"And when he was presented even with bipartisan legislation to try to stop the proliferation of guns, he did nothing."
"I mean, they threw him off the back of the train."
"Well, look, it is a campaign season, so every statement is going to be questioned for sincerity."
I wanted to mention this because I Pennsylvania is going to matter so much.
I don't think Democrats were happy at this interview either.
I am playing it as if Trump might win and I should be more optimistic.
They're saying Donald Trump's weird.
They've been called fickle because they're not a reliable age group to actually show up to the polls.
Let's play this for you.
Now she's backing off on them a little bit like she's doing with fracking because she wants to get elected.
He was alienated by the Democratic party.
Trump has virtually no chance in the Commonwealth.
The irony being of course AIPAC has funded and is supporting more than 100 Republicans who voted to not certify the election.
Break out of that bubble.
I'm Mary Season.
It's a dedication to all the ideals of what America stands for.
"If you have to rely on Kamala Harris for white working class appeal, you're screwed."
"I said, I said, are you voting for Donald Trump?"
"There's also just the question of are the people who are turning out to vote for Haley after she's already left the primary aren't these people who are probably not going to vote for Trump in the general election anyway, whereas maybe some of these uncommitted voters are still gettable."
Why is she honing in on this particular area of the state?
"I think the story, if Trump is also elected, as we saw in early 2017, folks from the RNC staffers come in and we're that first wave of staffers."
"But I also think she probably got the vibe from the skies like he's not a team player, he's not a team player."
"But yeah, I'd be happy to see you in Shapiro."
"Thank you, guys."
This is communist.
"And that's why I'm out here doing the work that I'm doing about talking with folks, listening with folks, because I'm running for President of the United States."
"In his 10th trip to the region since the war began in October, the top US diplomat will meet with senior Israeli leaders including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu."
You can download them on an external drive and you can play them whenever you want.
"Shapiro for his part says he's grateful to have had the opportunity to speak with Harris about her vision for the campaign ahead, but is excited to continue working to deliver results for Pennsylvanians as governor."
"Yeah, again, I think 2020, the polls were a lot closer than 2016."
"But the reason here is because while this is a group that still heavily supports Democratic candidates, they tend to lean Democratic."
Do you remember what America was like?
I'm not talking about how this is nonsense.
"The suburban surge, Harris's key to victory?"
"And Trump does want to negotiate with Russia, which for some reason is controversial here."
"Everybody knows that if we don't inspire the younger generation to be involved, then you're going to get communist policy because the left is going to go to the kids and tell them this is what you got to be, what you got to do."
Is there any policies or anything that she would change?
Pennsylvania is the most likely candidate.
"This is the Suffolk University poll, which again, number one rated in all of the 2021, 2022 polling."
And it's not necessarily in such a vital state.
And Democrats strategists dismiss it away.
That's H-I-M-S dot com slash M-E-I-D-A-S for your personalized ED treatment options.
I did So decision made there.
So she's already down by two to three points and this is when she should be pulling her best.
There were new polls that dropped out of the state of Michigan and he's leading in every single swing state.
She's not intelligent.
You see what happened yesterday?
"I say that because as a point of fact, it would require me, it did require me to receive votes not just from Democrats, but Republicans and independents as well."
Where are the cuts associated with that?
You just slap an extra cost on it.
"So I have one ask for everyone in the audience, everyone who watches this video, everyone in the live stream."
Joe D. Hope you got some money for those ads.
You made it possible for ordinary people like us.
"So yeah, y'all got it."
"And Donald Trump told ABC six, he was bragging about terminating Roe v Wade."
"A key county, Luzerne County, has more registered Republicans, I think, for the first time ever in their build up to the election here."
So there's a coordinated attack happening on specific polling markets.
It actually went the other direction.
"And that message is going to be, get out the vote and get out the vote early."
It doesn't make sense to.
It was there.
"It's all there publicly, but Donald Trump's gonna, Donald Trump, meaning he's just gonna go out there and lie."
Former president Obama called out black male voters last week.
I never thought I'd say it again.
"He has a track record that is unlike a VP pick we have seen in a very, very, very long time."
"And so I don't even venture a prediction, but I suspect we'll be at equilibrium for a while."
That's a county that voted for President Obama twice.
"Now, for those that don't know, back in 2020, the state of Pennsylvania, at least the electorate, was roughly 27 percent Catholic and Trump won Catholics in Pennsylvania by around 11 points."
The sun would be beaming down.
"Andrew, Ryan, both of you know who you're voting for, but a lot of your fellow students are still undecided."
He is beloved.
We have to talk about the 2024 presidential election because Donald Trump has great news out of Pennsylvania.
There's no place for you here.
It's part of it.
But she's worse than him.
"Now there's two key points after that, though."
She was asked very a very simple question.
"This is not only leading, but expanding the lead in a way that we haven't seen for Joe Biden in a really long time."
"We do know that when Trump was president, he worked to try to overturn temporary protective status, those sort of visas for Haitian immigrants."
Will Joe Biden manage to find his way to the podium or will he be wandering around at the wrong podium or looking for the door out the back or whatever?
We are all part of the divine nine.
Vearing off is bad.
We should use mail-in voting.
Maybe they think orange man bad.
"So where Trump has to be, Kamala Harris should not have to be."
James was asking kind of that differential there.
It's like trying to nail jelly to a wall.
Pennsylvania is arguably the largest swing state at play right now.
"Yeah, I mean, so definitely it's shifted around."
"A lot of it, right?"
"You know, I think as Democrats, we have a job to do to get out all across Pennsylvania to talk about our vision for this country, how we're going to create an economy that works for everyone, how we are going to make our community safer and how we're going to create ladders of opportunity for everyone."
President Trump.
The challenge though is that you know Pennsylvania on the issues lines up significantly more favorably for Donald Trump than it does for Kamala Harris.
What's critical for both campaigns is turnout.
"Which is interesting, right?"
"To your point, however, there's a brand new poll that just came out yesterday conducted by you go for CBS News and found that Harris has similar support for black voters as Joe Biden did in 2020."
"And if you look at, let's just look at Michigan, for example."
There's these marginal voters who may or may not show up.
He was turned looking at the jumbo screen when shots were fired.
They have no evidence of that at all.
"And I'm like, hey, you gotta bring Joe Biden to Erie and to pieces like Cambria and Bucks County."
"Every legal scholar felt and felt for a long time for 53 years, they've been trying to do it."
Do you think Democrats can hide the real Kamala Harris from America for 100 days?
"And it also means that just like last time around, remember we talked about that quote unquote red mirage because a lot of the Republican in-person votes on that day and in smaller counties where they're able to count things more quickly, those came in first."
"I'm focused every day on one thing and one thing only, and that is being the best governor I can be for the good people of Pennsylvania."
"Reporting from Atlanta Georgia, Iris Tao and Hyli News."
Anyone who will not bend to his will.
"Yeah, the fracking and the natural gas industry really does speak to the industrial heritage of Pennsylvania, steel, coal, cement."
"And if you look, Trump is close in Michigan and it's close in Pennsylvania, but he's farther ahead in other swing states."
"We've called on those refiner, refiners to operate safely, but quickly come back online."
And she constantly harangs former President Trump and voters still don't know who she is or what she is.
"If he's really winning Pennsylvania by two to three points, which, by the way, he's up in Arizona, Georgia, but we'll just say he doesn't win either of those states."
Because they know that those candidates are going to hurt their candidate camel.
"Since Biden has no longer been on the ticket, that question has gone away, even though we have one of the oldest candidates running for president still on the ballot."
And what could happen and this is something to always remember with primaries.
"And once you yield a little bit, that's just the beginning."
He expressed his disapproval of this decision.
He couldn't answer that question.
This is what we're up against.
"I mean, we see that on the five thirty eight numbers here, she's ahead by two point eight percent."
That's bull crap.
"Although as you point out, Nnedi, 80 percent of black men do support the vice presidents."
Because time is running out.
He ran important campaigns there.
"A month and two weeks ago, CNN was hosting the first presidential debate in Atlanta a month and two weeks ago."
Are you excited to be at a Trump rally right now?
We're just going to scrub it.
"Are you, that's sort of a bribe, but I think a prize by fuckers."
"Addressing the buzzing crowds in Pittsburgh, Barack Obama delivered some of his most personal and furious criticisms of Donald Trump."
And Scott Jennings said Trump does hold an advantage over Kamala Harris on the issue of the economy.
I mean that meant lots of people.
Come out there.
 Brand new polling is showing that Donald Trump is surging in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.
Where's Kelly at?
"Look, I want to see Kamala Harris deliver her vision for a future for all Americans, particularly for young Americans."
"The justice needs to be served on them, but not not in the form of a shooter."
"Tim, my man."
"And you have this administration that pretends like the economy is all fine, everything is going well, not really the best look."
"So we can see here with these poll numbers here in Pennsylvania, you know, it says who's ahead in Pennsylvania and you have this 1.2 margin."
"However, Pennsylvania stands out, with top strategists from both the Harris and Trump campaigns viewing it as the state most likely to swing the election."
Now these guys are not going to die.
"And in states like Georgia and Arizona, Biden way overperformed his numbers by 0.9 and 0.7 respectively."
"And not just that, but with the leaners, he's at 51%."
And it does seem as if Harris is in a much weaker position than these individuals.
I'll put it right here.
Delgado says this strategy reduced phone use by about 21 percent.
Pennsylvania put President Joe Biden over the top in 2020 and is expected to play a big role in this year's election.
"You're in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state."
It's why everyone ought to be watching CBS and watching the debate and see what see what transpires.
without Latinos and you do not win the presidency without P.A.
"He had that bronzer on thick and before our eyes, we someone who's truly in cognitive decline right there."
"Gallego with a much more sizable lead here, the largest of the two, he's running ahead of Kamala Harris, right?"
Doesn't have a picture of her.
"Latino voters here that I spoke with telling me, which means at a vote in the Senate, which means at a very important election and a very important vote, they know that in this battle for the state and the presidency, their vote can make a difference."
So good paying jobs for black men.
"Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, which has been trending Democrat in recent elections is looking good for him."
"I know they're lowering student loan debt I'm happy about that it benefits me first My sister got her loans forgiven I was really excited about that thank you Mr. Biden But what did the Democrats have planned for us especially as black folks Besides putting somebody who's one eighth African in the office and claiming that we have a black president again Who's married to a white man a Jewish white man Which is also in the middle of this Palestine Gaza versus Israel conflict Having a Jewish person in the White House with one heartbeat from the presidency or even a spouse I don't think we should criticize it but some are going to look at it as choosing a side And I know Donald Trump has Jewish family so maybe that's a negative but Right now I just want to beat Donald Trump I don't ever want to live under that clown again And I have the fear that should he take office he will never leave office again That's my fear so I've asked I begged and I encourage you all to go pursue an open and honest process for this de facto democratic primary If no one steps up and challenges her Hey, the Democrats have made their bed."
"Pennsylvania, obviously, is where he's from."
I figured that's a lot.
" Good evening everyone, I'm Lindsay Davis."
Our biggest fear is I don't know where though.
47% voted for Donald Trump.
"They're all coming here, even Christine Todd Whitman from across the Delaware River right behind me, the former New Jersey governor, sent just Republicans."
So I'm going to have to ask you for a really quick answer on this one.
And so they've been talking about us and we decided to talk about them as well.
Several shots were heard.
They're going to vote on their gut and their heart.
I was at those events.
A rally in the same fairgrounds where there was an assassination attempt in July.
We saw him here in Pittsburgh just last week as he kicked off a battleground blitz.
"So it really is a true battleground, a true toss-up here."
"There are reports suggesting Trump worked at him at Donald's, but that's not quite right because there's differences between work and stage theatrics."
"Trump at dogs and cats, the Democrats are the cats."
Tomorrow we're going to wake up we're going to go to Butler Pennsylvania get a little different view of Trump in Pennsylvania.
"You know, those flyover people, those middle class flyover folks."
So this is really remarkable stuff.
"So when Trump said the word black jobs, remember they lambasted him for that."
You have in-state pollsters like Mitchell Research.
"That's kind of what's going on here, but let's keep on going."
Vance type when it comes to trade policy farm policy and populist economics.
We're dead.
Pennsylvania I just talked about it was around 81 K votes.
Thank you a little bit more about why decided to come out.
You said that this is county who's been trending blue over the years.
She was a prosecutor.
"A lot of them not going to vote or they're going to vote third party, or maybe some of them might even cross over vote for Trump."
"Their poll before the election didn't have that many undecideds and it was actually very accurate, which is very telling because you need Pennsylvania."
"You know, it's interesting you mentioned that strategy of them going into a lot of red Pennsylvania rural areas, maybe places Democrats haven't always gone because for a long time the playback book for Democrats in Pennsylvania is just run up the score big time in the cities and just don't get clobbered in the places."
President Obama had the model in 2008 when he first ran.
"Historically, the state leaned Democratic in presidential elections from 1992 to 2012, consistently voting for Democratic candidates."
And those two people that went down are patriots and we love them.
"But you know, in the South Bronx, we had 25,000 people."
You are?
"It's like, what do you think about fracking?"
Talk to us a little bit more about what Biden had to say and what type of impact do you think it had?
But there's a process that this requires.
He needs to ge to what it was.
"So anyway, the secret service said that the UDA was fired multiple shots from a elevated position outside of the rally before he was on a live by agents."
"Obviously, Kamala Harris has managed to get under his skin and she's on his mind."
That is not good for Harris one bit.
Nevada has 6.
You were just there in the debate room and now with us.
"Let's, let's rate this on a scale from one to 10."
"Yes, Democrats are dominating early voting in Pennsylvania, but Republicans often make up ground on election day itself."
She wants to confiscate your guns.
I think you will.
"For parts of two centuries, scores of black men and women put their lives on the line for the right to vote, and that's what keeps voter engagement as a top priority for the National Panhellenic Council, the governing body for nine of the country's oldest and most prominent black sororities and fraternities."
"And so roughly a four point swing nationwide, well, what are we seeing in Pennsylvania?"
"Somebody else has got Oh, you know who it probably is."
The party in power is less motivated to vote.
"You can check out more content from my channel here, and as always, thank you so much for watching."
This is being recorded at 5.26 a.m.
No one knew that I sang before.
And so I think that is the thing that we are trying to course correct for.
And that's why you've got to vote.
There is truly a heartbeat.
"And she also, I thought, made a really important point for all of Donald Trump's bluster about energy."
Really really interesting.
These are some of the things I hear most often.
"If you think prices are high now, Donald Trump's message is, you ain't seen nothing here."
"So not completely worthless, but still good."
"This compares to a Quinnipiac poll of likely voters in Pennsylvania on August 14th, when Harris received 48 percent of support and Trump received 45 percent support."
"Well, this was the great question when Kamala Harris was making her VP selection, who should she select?"
And he like just kind of bobs.
"I'm sorry gentlemen, I've noticed this especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down is a sign of strength."
"Go back to 2016, 2020, 2004."
"But again, if Pennsylvania stays blue for Harris with 19 electoral votes, she has other options."
It's called the Morning Agenda Song of the Day August 2024.
You'll want to see that.
They be getting juicy though.
"We got to look at the bigger picture, not just those top line numbers."
And it is incumbent on me to earn the support.
So a lot of people think that Rasmussen is this right leaning pollster and it does have a right lean.
Trump did win the state in 2016.
But it is a response to concerns that have been raised largely over an issue in Alabama that has subsequently been resolved there too.
"But Ruben and I were talking to a remarkable group of men right before we came out and we were talking about this and somebody said, Man, I'm just so tired of everybody being divided and mean and nasty."

"But I think the other thing that people often should remember, you know, they're different people."

She's against fracking.
"Pennsylvania, often referred to as the Keystone State, holds a pivotal position in American politics."
"The perception among voters, among a slight majority of voters that were Donald Trump to win, he would leave abortion up to the states."

I don't think that it was.
"And when choosing the venue for her first rally featuring former President Barack Obama on October 10th, she once again returned to Pittsburgh."
"Nyle Scanage, White House columnist at The Hill, among a number of other titles at our sister publication."
"Dollars, they want to call them up and they want to deal with her."

"That will help, because raising kids is hard."
"And that's extended not only to on immigration, but also he said twice over the weekend that there is an enemy from within."
"Well, look, we're going to be out crisscrossing Pennsylvania."
That's why it was a warning sign when they had Trump up in battleground states in older maps.
Kamala Harris doesn't exactly have that point of strength.
"This is Pennsylvania netted them 5,000 new voters."
"So when we're looking through the details here, some things that jump out is one, 90% of likely voters that Marist polled with a candidate preference are strongly support their candidate."
"And this is despite the Republican frequently calling Latino countries a shithole, while terming Hispanic migrants as criminals and rapists."
I couldn't tell.
"Again, you've got in Kamala Harris, a candidate who can compete, not just in the suburban and urban areas, but in the rural areas as well and make some inroads."
But she does need to have a better answer.
Vote early if you can if you especially if you're in a swing state because you might not be able to on election day.
And then here's Trump.
He could be out there picking up litter trash.
"We have to go all the way back to late July for a head-to-head survey here, and it has Harris up 10 points, 50% to 40%, among 656 likely voters surveyed by SurveyUSA and a local news station in Minneapolis."
I just love teachers.
As Newsom did.
It's sad.
You cannot tell me that that's just a fluke.
He talked the talk of raising the minimum wage and keeping jobs and manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania and in America.
The economy was higher inflation was lower things were better overall and now with Kamala's Administration things haven't been so fantastic and she's saying she can fix the problems that her administration has caused But I just don't know if I can afford to take that risk Were you leaning towards the former president coming in tonight?
"And just that's the John Peterman's unit man, Charlie Moly."
Did the especially women what we w the right to vote.
The intricacies of Pennsylvania's electoral landscape necessitate that candidates adopt sophisticated approaches tailored to regional differences.
They're raising a lot more money now.
See you later.
"It's like a constant, like down by three, three, three, four."
"They maybe haven't seen a campaign like this because of covid, because of the things that's happening."
It's very hard to say.
"So if Harris is winning Pennsylvania, there's a good chance of the bare minimum she's up in Michigan, where at that point, yeah, she just needs one more state."
And the polling data shows that people are less certain about what she is or what her intentions are or what her sort of foundational principles are.
We've got folks in rural communities in Pennsylvania who are now getting the high speed Internet turned on for the first time because of our partnership with the Biden-Harris administration.
"Again, some areas where perhaps Donald Trump has shown some weakness with traditional voters as Republican voters rather, as sort of that Republican coalition is being reimagined and repurposed by the Trump campaign."

"Maybe it gets a little bit tighter, but they were trying to get Biden out and that's when those polls came out and they had Trump up by five or six and basically all the Rust Belt states."
Kamala Harris has fought at every turn to move America forward.
"So I think it's going to be similar to the 2016 Hillary election, where they declare Trump the winner by about two a.m. Eastern Standard Time, or maybe it was later than that."
I do think it's important that we remember that the map looks really different from 2008.
"Chereeka, it's a great question."
"She is a San Francisco Democrat that is again further left than the average Democrat in, in my home state."
Give me a freaking break.
He's not energizing turnout and he's been spending tens of millions of dollars.
The fourth poll was conducted between September 18th and 20th by RMG Research among 783 likely voters.
So I was recently on the campaign trail with Bernie Marino who's the GOP Senate nominee in Ohio.

"Some weird stuff, Senator, what do you when you see that?"
"In just a week, the Republicans gained 12000 new voters."
The first is a town hall.

He ran in and won it.
The Trump in Dorsey campaigning with Oz.
That's not going to happen.
He's got states like Wisconsin locked down.
How how the hell is this a high-quality poll?
"There were threats early on that were pretty generic in nature, but as days went on, they became a lot more specific, providing my address, graphic descriptions of what they would do to my family."
What can you tell us about the event today that's going to be held in Pennsylvania?
800 likely voters were sampled here between August 18th and 19th.
I think J.D.
I found it to be quite bizarre.
Harris or Trump.
Do you understand why that is?
That makes me feel really good.
Chester might move left a little bit.
And there's other one.
His donation reflects his confidence in Harris' ability to guide the country toward a future where technology plays a central role in driving economic growth and ensuring national security.
They're just ancestral Democrats?
Younger people don't answer their phones for a poll.
"Well Anderson we do come to you from Allentown in the heart of the beautiful Lehigh Valley in eastern, Pennsylvania And we are with eight residents of the Lehigh Valley Who've been watching television with us tonight and watching Kamala Harris's speech?"
I'm not going to go super long.
"Who are people of color who are sold on their message, you know, just do your own research Try not to be so biased try not to trust and everything that you hear on TV do your own research And once you start doing your own research and going down that rabbit hole You can make an honest opinion based off of that, you know And I feel like everybody deserves a fair chance, but Trump definitely has my attention when it comes to certain things that he talks about and I just like how direct he is and how you know, you know not so He doesn't just bow down to the media and I like that if Kamala Harris were to be elected She'd be the first black female president."
And we have to talk about some polling that came out of some Bellwether counties in Pennsylvania.
"Now, this product is not an official."
"But you've got to listen now when she explains to you why, as Erie goes, so goes the country."
"Oh, Benny, you're just using one video to make a point, or this is just a video that went viral."
"Listen, I have served as governor under Joe Biden and under President Donald Trump."
"And two weeks later, right here in the great state of Pennsylvania, Pow!"
"But it really does seem to be kind of coming into full view now that that's going to be the state, ultimately, that could well decide the election."
"If a non-citizen tried to cast a ballot, would you be able to catch it?"
I think the guy is worse than Pat Toomey.
We are surrounded by thousands and thousands and thousands of our fellow Americans who are looking forward to November the 5th and returning America to our American citizens.
And that is that this election is really about the future.
"This is and by the way, I work well with Republicans."
"I mean, Scott Perry, literally after the mob was cleared from the state Capitol on January 6th, he went to the well of the House of Representatives, rose to his feet, sought recognition from the chair of the House of Representatives at the time, and proceeded to say that the votes of the good people of Pennsylvania should be thrown out because Donald Trump told him to say that."
It's yet and it really just comes down to turn out at the end of the day.
"And I think one of the reasons for that is just what I spoke about, the concentrated effort by very powerful forces, the wealthiest people on the planet Earth, descending upon Pennsylvania to hit both of us pretty hard."
Most people don't realize that they seem to think that there was a bigger margin for Biden in 2020 than there was for Clinton in Philadelphia.
But clearly issue number one for voters is still an advantage category for Donald Trump.
A woke military.
"Okay, I've talked myself back into it."
Everyone let's thank President Trump.
You can't kill me.
You might wonder what they had in common.
You only need one more.
New polls were shared after the last polls in which Harris achieved great success.
Why has it been so hard for Democrats to get over the hump in North Carolina?
"Rod Edwards, a family friend of the Walz family, confirmed to the Examiner that the photo is indeed authentic."
They did everything they could.
You want to win the champion.
For a good while.
"If you look at polls Trump is leading men by I think in the in an August Wall Street Journal poll he's leading men by about 10 points, Harris is leading women by about 13."
No rest for the weary today.
The consequences of failing to engage effectively with both urban and rural constituents could prove dire for Harris.
"This shift could prove critical in the election, especially in areas where labor unions still hold significant influence."
A lot of the people who are uncertain at this time are not going to vote based on intricate policy issues.
"So aside from her answer, which I do believe she needs to be much more clear on, at this stage, she should be very specific."
Sometimes families are getting divided.
"You mean those voters who maybe don't want to say who they're voting for out loud, but then when they're in that voting booth?"
So so creative.
It's not the same as Nevada.
"Hello, my name is Vanessa and I'm a volunteer with the Harris campaign."
Whatever that means.
Or I would honestly argue are more progressive when it comes to Israel and Gaza than others on the ticket.
"But his campaign wants him to say, get out the vote early here in Georgia, as early voting is underway behind me three weeks to go until the election is left."
I'm not doing this for myself.
And then he talks about the lowest unemployment rate.
That's something I'm trying to do as well.
This is not good for Harris at all because if Republicans are now picking up steam and early voting and now this drops.
She's a communist.
"Guardian, Chris Riddell's latest cartoon humorously captures the Democrats' current advantage over the Republicans, highlighted by a bizarre conversation between Donald Trump and Elon Musk."
The back to back errors in 2016 and 2020.
"Now, crowd size alone does not predict who's going to win."
And Harris does count with the same level of support among this voting group as Biden did in 2020.
My part two video will be about do I think Trump getting shot at will change public opinion.
"Now, if you take Fayette County, which I mentioned earlier, talking in comparison to Philadelphia County, you actually have a 10% decrease in the amount of voters voting there, yet the numbers have gone up 13% for Donald Trump during this time."
He wants to send the military after American citizens.
"Competing with the crowd and the music around her, we did doing a gamely, as always."
Could you imagine after 40 hours you get time and a half and no tax on that time and a half money?
But now the surveys seem to indicate that Kamala Harris is now pulling ahead of Donald Trump.
"See, this is like a secret weapon era."
"Whereas the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to my knowledge, I don't think anybody suffered other than they've, you know, they've worked hard and they've done great things."
Do you believe it?
"Today is Wednesday, not Wednesday, Thursday, August 15th."
" Shifting focus former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris campaign in Pennsylvania, one of the seven key US swing states."
Donald Trump's back ahead.
And in doing that he got shot in the face.
And people are very committed and strunk.
"She's probably going to bleed around 5% support, one could say, conventionally, just based on the current state of affairs in the country."
"A lot of people on the right have been very critical of Dr. Oz, including myself, and I will continue to be critical of Dr. Oz."
"And if it did, please share it with your friends and on your socials because you can play a big part in spreading the word about us while helping the morning agenda reach more people like you."
"How political talks is so, so, uh-huh."
We're seeing Trump doing it and we're seeing the Harris-Wallis campaign doing this work.
"And yet when Donald Trump lies or cheats or bullies or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls service members like John McCain losers because they died in battle or were captured, when he calls fellow citizens vermin or the enemy within, people make excuses for it."
Look at this guy.
And now there's actually been an update on the overall voter registration edge.
And it's an issue for him that is very strong.
"And all he did with it was give a tax cut to people who did not need one, and drove up the deficit in the process."
What do you think about this?
But there's various reasons for that.
"It is Tuesday, August 6th, and this is being recorded at 5.26 a.m."
Do your job.
She has been asked these questions before.
"Make no mistake, Donald Trump in the 2020 election, he didn't even get 47% nationally."
We do.
"Marist, it was D plus nine."
A recent poll conducted by Fabrizio Lee and associates and ML associates between October 6 and 9 surveyed 800 likely voters.
"The culinary workers union, massive popular labor union in that state."
"So it could potentially happen where, you know, they both get 49s and that's what it ends up coming down to until like Georgia type ish, right, where it gets that close."
"Like all these Buddha judge, all the people that were in consideration, they got over it, but not Mr. Shapiro."
So you really want Donald Trump to win?
Presidential talks.
"Look, I don't know what the hell Donald Trump's doing with his money."
Are you doing?
"This is not going to win him any votes and in fact could potentially cost him some votes in some of these swing states where they say, look, why should we be spending money on, more state and local tax deductions for people who live on the coast when I'm living in Nevada or Pennsylvania or Michigan and I need to see my household budget get more relief."
That was the state that decided the 2020 election.
This is an outlier.
"We believe that true freedom gives each of us the right to make decisions about our own lives, how we worship, who we marry, what our family looks like."
What do you expect to come out of this interview and will it ultimately help her?
She just basically repeated everything that Biden has said in the past.
"And then today, the Franklin and Marshall College poll, which is an entirely in-state poll, they don't do anything nationally."
That's consistent with another poll that was in the field from AARP and basically the average of polls in Pennsylvania.
University of Pennsylvania professor Matt Levendusky says the state's urban-rural divide rolls into campaign strategy.
And the article really highlights that.
Harris leads this poll by four points.
The upcoming debates between Harris and Trump are highly anticipated and could be pivotal in swaying undecided voters.
"I love you, John."
Will they have to spend more money there?
So it's great to see you.
 Let's pivot now to Libby Cathy.
I want you guys to pay attention to how media and publishers are treating image-based content from today.
Peace
"Conversely, a decrease in turnout compared to the 2020 election could tilt the scales in favor of Trump, enabling him to reclaim previously democratic strongholds."
"Everybody bend your knees real quick, because sometimes when you stand too long, you get a little faint."
"You can also make that up, but still now that it's not to 160 K now that we're seeing counties flipping to Trump, you can see updated another county flips to Trump in Pennsylvania."
Bring them in now.
"And that's the challenge she has that that really lies ahead and that Donald Trump still gets to drive home regardless of what he says, regardless of who he offends."
"And I say that in the most ironic way possible, Quinnipiac."
Both Harris and Trump are receiving an unprecedented level of security.
"And he has quite a, you know, he's a veteran on Capitol Hill."
"It was it was a great experience, honestly."
I'm kind of recovering from my cold and we have to talk about some new developments in the 2024 election.
His overseas tax cut pledge contrasts with the policies that would raise the taxes for businesses manufacturing offshore with tax reforms estimated to exceed $10 trillion over the next decade.
He would not vote for Trump a third time.
South Korea.
You want to do.
"That's a big question, because another poll, this ABC Ipsos poll, who looked across the high contenders for the Veep stakes here, none of them really have national name recognition."
"And he's always been unintelligent, etc."
The Biden-Harris administration has fought a war on American energy production since day one.
It's no big deal.
"Here, it's going to go down a little bit."
"But other than that, I mean the guy's in great shape and Trump has lost a couple pounds since the election ended."
It was by the thinnest of margins.
You have got to send him back to the United States Senate for the time that I was in the United States Senate and worked with Bob.
"The New York times as Trump served up McDonald's fries, vitriol boiled outside."
"However in their poll just after the debate they got the same result, showing no gains for either candidate."
The administration is a new generation.
"And meanwhile, Donald Trump and his running mate were making up stories, circulating stories about how the Biden administration was withholding aid and not giving it to Republican areas and giving it to undocumented immigrants, just making stuff up."
Was it that decisive of an evening Scott?
"So who wins, who loses?"
This election cycle has been all about Donald Trump maintaining and building momentum.
No matter how many lawsuits or court cases when something is proven.
Or is this a sign of larger problems within the campaign?
"So she's preparing prior to that as opposed to reacting, right?"
"And as a result, we're losing our country."
This is Marist slash NPR.
"Now, it was also an extremely pro-union town Big time pro-union One of the more impressive things in my childhood was my father going on strike When I was about 9 or 10 years old, my little 411 mother took her but to the still mill if you can believe it or not To support our family While my dad struck for three or four months with the electric company and got his money up with the union So these are the basis of my politics I'm a hardcore Democrat Not a Democrat, rather A hardcore leftist liberal politician type of person Here comes politics I left the Democratic Party Depending on what they do, I may rejoin the Democratic Party But those are my roots Conservatism to me means something completely different Understanding where I come from, it is now Trump country It is now completely red After everything I just told you Jack Mirtha, I went to college with his grandson So it's not like the Mirthas weren't in the area They were in the area, right?"
"Yeah, it's really, really well said."
Trafalgar Whitmer plus one.
Just huge.
"And with that being said, seeing Donald Trump's willingness to come back to a place where he nearly died, I'm getting off the podcast chair and I'm coming out for the first time in a few years to one of these rallies."
You want to know the truth?
"Well, she has a whole post dedicated to that one, which is, whoa, no one should go to jail for smoking weed, which is hilarious, because Kamala Harris prosecuted and put people in jail for smoking weed, which is just wild."
"Remember back in 2016 when Jill Stein got 1% of the vote in Michigan, Trump won it by 0.3%."
"Ergo, she's tough on crime."
"And in Pennsylvania, it was called a red mirage, because it looked like Trump had all these more votes because they didn't count the absentee votes until that day."
This is good in Pennsylvania.
"I agree, but it's a little bit more complicated."
So it's not just ancestral Democrats.
 That decision yesterday didn't do a damn thing to prevent abortions.
It was a drawing.
She's ready.
So they don't think for themselves.
Kamala Harris received 51% of the vote and Donald Trump 46%.
"And they've urged Harris in private meetings to do more to turn out voters of color, which is strange because Kamala is a person of color."
At a two percentage point clip.
"And that was, and you tell me you had this on your bingo card."
We'll be back soon to explore another topic shaping the 2024 election.
We would expect Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to go to Trump.
And it's also controversial because it extracts fossil fuels.
Our Pennsylvania's Electoral College votes the ones that are actually going to decide the outcome.
You can't exactly do that.
"Congressman, part of the surge in Democratic enthusiasm once President Biden dropped out of this race was this idea that the race would become less a referendum on Biden, more of a referendum on Trump."
We're a fucking union.
A sitting president on a union picket line.
"Of Pennsylvania's close to one million foreign-born residents, more than half are naturalized citizens and are able to vote in the upcoming election."
Same thing with Suffolk.
"But in my opinion, the biggest disaster for Harris comes from a voter block that I don't think is getting enough attention this cycle."
"And now, and so like it was all this fear mongering, but like this is a perfect example of just how absurd it actually is."
"But the argument that was made by the GOP was that, sure, Kamala Harris could re-inspire the Democratic base, but Trump would re-inspire the Republican base even more against Harris than Trump."
They're going around Butler.
" Now with three weeks to go until the US presidential election, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have held rival campaign events in the battleground state of Pennsylvania."
Every poll in the RCP average has shifted at least three points towards Trump.
"I mean, in the month of August, Republicans gained 21000 voters."
You're part of the fracking process.
I want to start with this new polling that continues to show an even tighter presidential race than what we were seeing even just a week ago.
"He's going to cut the business tax rate to 15 percent, but only for companies that make their product in America and hire American workers is going to make America competitive again and bring jobs back here at home."
I just thought that was funny.
"Yes, we do."
But 45% of people said the economy was good.
"But what I do think is interesting, both North Carolina and Arizona are similar in that they're battlegrounds where the Republican is favored, but they have unpopular candidates on the ticket."
They're both.
We told you.
"With the singer endorsing Kamala Harris, do these high profile endorsements even matter that much?"
"One of the biggest issues driving voter behavior in Pennsylvania is the economy, particularly as it relates to the state's energy sector."
"When push comes to shove, when it's election day, it really is going to come down to individual state considerations, you know, whether whether they think their vote will count."
They're implying their opinion.
I want to see civility.
"In the context of his statements, Shapiro emphasized that the outcome of the election in Pennsylvania might ultimately determine whether or not the current president is re-elected."
Three months.
"And that is the problem for Donald Trump, because it would be one thing at the New York Times in a college poll was a fluke and he tried to write it off as such."
We need more art.
Absolutely It's funny because the Democrats and Kamala Harris have been calling Donald Trump a threat to democracy Have you heard this stuff and what do you make of that when you hear that?
So talking about all you Trump supporters are being negative and violent.
"I mean, are we at a billion yet?"
All right everybody saw the Trump rally where he was potentially you know tried to be taken and one or two things could be true.
"It's brave, but it's historic."
"Historically, democratic-leaning, these suburbs have seen an influx of educated voters who may be more inclined to engage with issues like health care, education reform, and social justice."
"And it's like he said in the middle of the pandemic, when he said, I do not take any responsibility at all."
That's the first one.
"My gosh, this would be horrifying."
"Trump plans a rally in Wilkes-Barre, while Harris will tour western Pennsylvania starting in Pittsburgh."
Take a look at one example.
He cared more about winning an election than he did to actually solve the problem.
"As we mentioned earlier, former President Trump is heading to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania tonight for his first rally in that state since his assassination attempt this month in Butler."
What do you think is really going on in the country right now?
"So, yeah, later in the debate, they did agree that they could agree on some things around gun safety, but not much."
"I don't know, it could be one reason."
Philadelphia City is probably going to move right.
Patriot polling is here also.
"Now, so those are his intentions."
"And they're very, very happy."
He built it all.
"Yesterday, Donald Trump's town hall event just outside of Philadelphia was seemingly cut short when members of the crowd fainted."
"Therefore, he's probably the favorite to win the presidency."
"Okay, Detroit."
The bipartisan border deal supported by the border patrol union.
"So that third party vote shares really capped them, which also makes sense why RFK Jr. backed out of the race and endorsed him because he kind of got his support gutted with this switch up on the Democratic side."
"I know this is going to seem sort of subtle to people, but this is a market change from where we were 10, 15 years ago when the best way to get a Democrat to stop talking about policies that would support people would be to pretend like there was some type of like deficit hockery and that they needed to justify these things, which was all just garbage."
I gave her a B plus B B plus a B plus a a C C so mostly A's and B's with one C I'm gonna ask you why you made the decision you made first I'll be start with Scott who is the president of the UAW local here in the Lehigh Valley Scott What what grade did you give it again?
And that becomes the center and the just the normal and the average.
Russell's donation is not only a reflection of her wealth but also of her belief in Harris' vision for a more just and equitable America.
"Guantanamo is going to be a well-oiled machine in the next 30 days because all enemies, foreign and domestic, everybody's pointing fingers at this point."
Did yesterday's verdict surprise anyone you talked to?
Donald Trump has returned to the place where someone nearly took his life.
The race did narrow here in the middle of September and again at the end of October.
"It's, it's, I mean, he won North Carolina in 2020 and 2016."
I found this part super interesting about the Quinnipiac poll and basically the questions they asked so on the issues.
I wouldn't want to do business here.
"Yeah, what is a tape?"
It's not just policies are on the ballot.
We saw previously that we played here on the show about how the poor areas of Philadelphia are actually swinging at Trump.
"Pivotal, pivotal, pivotal."
I love how it goes into full bot mode.
It's hard to know who has that disposition until they have the opportunity to be that person.
"So while you hear what these job gains and the Biden administration and they are very much real, they don't hit every single county in this country equally."
"So what would a the question is, I'm going to bring it up again."
We're going to have to sit back and watch how everyone responds to this and see if everything I just said plays out which I know it fucking will but until then something in my stomach is telling me we're cooked we're so cooked.
All that you see behind me is all shipping ready to leave on Tuesday.

The drug problem's a little bit of a red herring.
"They'll be counted regardless of this, you know, irrelevant sort of, you know, useless just error that they're trying to use to try to throw them out."

"The success of Harris's campaign hinges on her ability to bridge this significant divide, ensuring that her messaging resonates with urban voters who prioritize social justice, equality, and health care, while simultaneously addressing the concerns of rural voters who are more focused on economic recovery, job creation, and the revitalization of their communities."
And now Donald Trump has a lead.

So what do you think about art in terms of freedom of speech and where art in freedom of speech lies right now in the current state of America?

Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 47 percent each.
"We got the Make Cats Safe Again merch, which is a best seller in the Trump iconic design."
So this is the place where Democrats have a big anchor with their votes.
Will Pennsylvania go red or blue this time?
"NBC's Peter Alexander has that, plus a new controversy swirling around Trump."
Just look at the visits from the candidates and the money being spent.
Kamala.
It is a majority of the electorate in the state of Pennsylvania.
"I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within, not even the people that have come in and destroying our country, by the way, totally destroying our country, the towns, the villages that are being inundated."
"When you have Kamala Harris going out there and basically saying, no, we need to not end the war in Ukraine, that's not going to appeal to these people, even these Polish Americans who don't like Putin, because they despise war even more."
"Yeah, without question."
"And when you say tight, just to put it into perspective for you, 2016, it was what, 1800 votes?"
 I know you are in Georgia right now.
The rural areas of Pennsylvania add another layer of complexity to the electoral calculus.
It's the same thing playing a margins game in a place they know they won't win margins matter.
"Okay, for those of you just joining in Butler, Pennsylvania at a rally of about 50,000 patriotic Trump loving Americans gathered together on a Saturday to hear about the president's agenda."
"Terry Moran live from that Trump event in Johnstown, Pennsylvania."
That's when Democrats had their initial surge in voter registration.
But here is Harris with a decidedly different rhetorical approach to this age old question that we get from the Beltway Press.
"Vance, as weird."
Their argument now is that Donald Trump lost all of these jobs.
And that was brutal because we could have got a really massive upgrade there.
"And we know home ownership is, black families are 40% less likely to be homeowners than others."
I heard today that it was an espionage case.
And a decision handed down is the state is being hotly contested in the presidential contest.
This shouldn't even be a question.
She needs to be showing that she takes these issues seriously.
"But to see Harris basically, I'm not going to take the bait."
And 43 percent of the nation has a favorable view of Kamala Harris that is the highest it has been since July 20th of 2021.
We'll never get one like Trump again.
"But I'm not sure that solves the problem because part of the problem here is these big steel mills, these big really costly steel mills are just outdated and cost inefficient."
I want to travel to work in one.
Her first responsibility in the job title is to these families.
Donald Trump spent his entire presidency trying to dismantle it.
"And I know you're a busy man, so let's go back to work and I'll see you up there."
Let's let's look at this together.
"If you're a Democratic voter, you're in a lot of the same places."
Oh my gosh I'm so excited.
And we're really optimistic in Philly.
"Well, Donald Trump and the debate coming up this week."
But two thirds of Trump voters say that it is not.
We'll get right into it like we always do when we talk about the latest in national polling.
"Even if it's Dems plus one, it's still good for Republicans because of the way the electoral math works."
And I think what she's doing so effectively is connecting the dots between his rhetoric and the real policies that he's put in place and that he will put in place.
"And last, I want to make it clear, if President Trump does a rally during a weekday, we are going to be busing people from whatever county he's doing a rally in to a board of elections to vote early."
"And here she says to him, do you want to, you want us to play your songs?"
"In recent elections, Pennsylvania has been decided by razor-thin margins."
"It's influencing their choices in the polls, and both candidates know it."

"Dick Cheney was pretty much seen as this side of Henry Kissinger, the worst war criminal."
" Meanwhile, Pennsylvania bakery is dipping into politics and voters are eating it right up."
They felt like he had six people.
Here's the thing.
And I'm all for that.
What do you say to that kind of voter?
Decisions is being letting you.
"Governor Shapiro two years after that, he won by 62,000 in Bucks County, PA. Every election, I spent a lot of time covering elections in Bucks County the last few cycles."
Chuck Schumer has become a Palestinian.
I just took a picture with that handsome guy.
"It's all about what happened here at Butler, Pennsylvania on J13."
"I mean, you do."
Democrats talk about challenging in Florida.
Cheney also had a specific message about abortion for those women in the audience so back in 2022 Cheney had said that she supported the overturning of Roe versus Wade but her message today is that even if these voters support if they've even if these voters are anti-abortion rights her message is that they should still vote for Harris because those abortion bans have now gone too far and are putting women's lives at risk.
His surrogates and even Hamlet Truth Social have gone after many pollsters over the past three weeks that have shown Kamala Harris in the advantage point in Pennsylvania.
They believe now in a campaign that's that's floundering and will say anything.
That's the way it goes.
"And whether Governor Shapiro gets the not or not, what is clear is he has the support from voters we spoke with Josh Sanders, CBS News Philadelphia."
"And the production has come from private land, not government land, largely vast majority."
But it turned out to be a hefty house cat.

"Join me today as the Center Squares Pennsylvania editor, Kristen Smith."
"So Donald Trump said, I want to thank the United States Secret Service and all of the law enforcement for their rapid response to the UDA that took place in Butler, Pennsylvania."

"In the seventh poll, from August 6th to 9th, which was also conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, with different with 693 registered voters, Harris received 45% of the vote, while Trump received 43%."
Right now I don't see much with Senator Casey.
And what's the president doing?
But I'm sayi happened last time.
We'll be watching that this week as well.
It finds that right now the race for the White House is close with Kamala Harris having a one point edge over former President Trump nationally.
So here we are.
What's important to voters there and is it comparative at all to Wisconsin?
She believes in entrepreneurship.
But is this an opportunity for the Biden campaign in that region?
A couple of different things here.
Trump's argument is that Dr. Oz is who can win the general election.
"And we should have a leader of this nation, a leader of the free world who at least meets those standards that most parents try and hold their children to."
And I think both campaigns realize that.
"But he comes off as the Chuck's guy next door, you know, football coach."
"Now, in fairness, his other big economic plan is to slap tariffs on everything from food to TVs."
I think it's a pretty interesting strategy She supports miss Harris's plan to continue backing Ukraine's military efforts to repel Russia Even as mr. Trump has suggested that a deal could be brokered to avert more suffering if Ukraine goes to Putin It is the beginning of a domino effect.
No one can predict the future.
"I mean, obviously that debate was the number one trending topic on earth, on the freaking planet, because we're not a big channel."
"So, we have a new poll that came out today from Harvard Harris."
Maybe it was July or and then Kennedy died on the other end.
But what's different now like especially looking at the House is that the the makeup of the Republican Conference is far more Trump aligned and Trump comfortable now compared to in 2017 when you have a lot of House Republicans who had been there and even newer House Republicans who are rejecting kind of Trump's economic message.
Or is this based on what you're just recently saying that it really doesn't matter for Donald Trump?
The legal victory in Pennsylvania can also help consolidate support among Republicans.
So a lot of stuff growing in Pennsylvania Her Hispanic numbers generally going up and I actually think Pennsylvania is more likely to go blue than Wisconsin Which is actually better because Pennsylvania is 19 electoral votes Pennsylvania under or Pennsylvania is 19 Wisconsin is just 10 so much much better to win Pennsylvania than Wisconsin
America has never.
"People who are likely going to vote for Joe Biden are now not only voting for Kamala Harris, but they're also taking lawn signs, putting them on their lawn."
That's a seven point swing and 44% of likely voters had a favorable view of opinion of Donald Trump while 53% have an unfavorable opinion.
"What we do know, and I thought Kamala Harris prosecuted this case effectively, is that Trump would just give Putin and give Russia exactly what they want and would make that entire region less stable, would put NATO at extraordinary risk, NATO countries and our allies at extraordinary risk."
"First up, Donald Trump zigzagged between economic remarks and personal insults at a rally in critical Pennsylvania."
Former President Trump appeared in two televised town halls.
Will I get to the next charging station?

"You have to win Arizona, Nevada, and then Michigan."
"They also got nervous, too, when she failed to get some of the key endorsements from some of the organized unions that Joe Biden got before."

"Marcus Conte reporting live from the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Trump rally."
"On the pathway to 270, Harris is 226."

Never did I think that lead could cause so many health issues for my family.
I gave her an A and how come an A because she hit all the points That I wanted to know about I wanted to know more about her her economic Policies her foreign policy.
"If he gets over 15% of black votes, she's done."
"All right, so we got 40, what's that?"
"Terry, let's unpack there."
"If you want to see it in full without my commentary, but without further ado, let's go ahead and roll it."
"I'm not exactly sure how he stacks up as a candidate now, compared to then he was much stronger in 2020 than he was in 2016."
"One is that Vice President Harris has been very intentional from the start of this campaign to treat every single voting cohort with the respect they are due, meaning she does not take anyone for granted and she has worked hard to cultivate and curate policies that speak to their needs."
And then this iconic picture of the staff leaving when Trump won hilarious.
"But when you look at the early vote numbers, it looks like a disaster."
That's in the corner down by Ohio and West Virginia.
"All right, Brandon, thank you so much for weighing in."
"But just him as a person, um, I think he would compliment her."

"And in the United States Senate, many of you know when I was a senator, for the time I was there, I had the great joy and pleasure of working with Senator Bob Casey."
And now the most recent surveys from September and October indicate that Harris leads Trump at forty seven to forty one percent among the suburban voters.
 Welcome back everyone.
I know what it's like to come from a working class family.
And one of the things you had to do was go into court and basically preserve the kind of integrity of the state's election system underneath the sort of fuselage of lawsuits from the Trump campaign and others.
Ever.
"Now, our sponsor, Henson Shaving, solves both problems with the plastic disposable razors."
But the airwaves right now are completely inundated with political ads.
"I said, there's something about this guy we need to be mindful of because he connects with people in a way that our candidate at the time was not, even though our candidate was touting the pro-life agenda and all of that."
"But President Trump conducting diplomacy with our enemies, I think was very was very important for for our country to maintain our status as the world's number one superpower."
They're the only ones right now that found Trump losing Pennsylvania.
"But now not only is he not doing any harm, he's doing a lot of good for the Kamala Harris campaign."
I know Kamala Harris can be that president for the entire nation and certainly for the good people of Pennsylvania.
"In addition to some live streams down at Mar-a-Lago, including one person who brought a Cybertruck with that infamous fight, fight, fight picture on it from the Butler assassination attempt, this is just one angle that the Trump campaign has done to get Donald Trump out there to younger voters who they believe can turn out for them."
And you could argue that's the reason he won Pennsylvania.
He won every county in Michigan.
This is the story of this person.
"They're considered either red, meaning they'll vote for a Republican, or blue."
We'll be checking up on that later.
"Again, thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you all later today."
"What about the Taylor Swift effect, right?"
"So geographically, demographically, and with a Republican at the top of the ticket for governor that they think they can sort of demonize, they think they have a chance here to make North Carolina competitive."

"Moving forward to the sixth poll, also conducted by Spry Strategies on the same dates with a different 600 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 45%."

"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision is critical because it mandates that all mail-in ballots must be signed and dated by voters, and they must be returned within a specified timeframe."
"Yes, So we're here live in But PA at the Trump rally, his an appearance here in But it very easy for you."
And I watch his campaign rallies.
"Well, look, I think if you look at the people lining up to be surrogates for Kamala Harris, it's far more plentiful."
We heard Trump talk about many of the themes that he's touched on over the years.
Otherwise we'd be flooded with Chinese cars and and all of our factories would close would have no jobs at all in the auto industry.
"But it is a good indicator, especially if it's like every single update, it's more and more Republican."
And there are lots of union workers in my region who rely on that industry.
"President Biden talking about tangible benefits, whether it's healthcare, whether it's social security, whether it is jobs, jobs, and better paying jobs, whether it's helping unions, being there with workers, whether it's infrastructure, whether it's the chips act bringing important jobs here in the semiconductor industry, investing in America, whether it is protecting veterans, protecting seniors."
That's how kind of crazy this is.
"By focusing on these issues, Trump hopes to strengthen support from rural voters and attract more middle-class suburban voters."
"No, I don't."
"Last question, Selena."
"So at this point what she is looking to do is get that crossover appeal to some Republicans or some moderate, some people who may be on the fence, some moderate Republicans, folks that may be on the fence, about what is it that could potentially give them an appeal to Kamala Harris, what could potentially get them over to her side."
"Here, I'll go to Real Clear Politics, which I have not, I have not cited Real Clear Politics yet today."
That was a political liability for Republicans and particularly for Donald Trump.
The voter registration numbers look good.
Scranton's a place that climbs into your heart and it never leaves.
"And that contributed to a shortfall of more than 19,000 blood donations."
Erie.
"To basically flip this inflation, which what a year a couple years ago, they said that inflation was not going to be long term."
Vice President Harris is running mate Governor Tim Walz announced new plans from the team for America's rural areas.
"Every Sabbath, every Sunday, if you go to church, you go to church, you break bread, in remembrance of him, this is my body which I have given up for you."
He has supplemental social security.
"In terms of former President Trump, he is I mean, he's going all around the country holding tons of rallies and he's sticking to this message that, you know, Kamala Harris will destroy this nation if she's elected."
This is pretty highly unlikely.
"Meanwhile, Rasmussen also called the race and PA within their margin of error and only missed it by two points overestimating the Democrats."
And they're recent enough that that's fair game if he wants to talk about when she was a proponent of ending fracking.
"If it goes heavily margin in favor of Democrats, this could legitimately decide the election."
Senator Pat Toomey.
Now Trump is plus three in Pennsylvania and you do have the Senate very close with Casey only up by two over McCormick.
He's in a steel town.
But he's not backing down from backing Kamala Harris in this race.
"The results reveal that Kamala Harris is polling at 46 percent, while Donald Trump leads with 49 percent, granting him a three-point advantage in this battleground state."
"Uh, there's so many situations out there, right?"
It's 5050.
"Yeah, you can get."
In the studio.
"Now, you mentioned that this poll doesn't bring a lot of clarity."
That's why I believe he was able to win Pennsylvania.
Jill Stein is a huge issue.
"It's unclear, Chanel."
"But he's making the same argument to them that their lives would improve, same as any of these battleground states, on things like immigration and the economy, if Donald Trump gets reelected."
Two voters and voter group analysis.
So I've actually been canceled pretty much from the visionary culture.
"And I think at this point she can only go upwards by being herself, being moderate and being strong."
And he responds to every attack line.
"You know, and all this stuff, it's not going to happen, but that would be awesome."
There's a handful of them.
"That said, sexism is, of course, still part of our American politics."
"So maybe you can criticize Donald Trump for that and say he's dumb, but there's a big difference between someone who's willing to sacrifice and someone who is stupid."
A 16 point advantage enough so that Pennsylvania went from being likely red to lean red to tilt red to toss up and now lean blue.
Never touches the human hand.
Now some people don't agree with me.
Do they not smell the looze already?
They have those industrial steel towns.
I Liked how she spoke from her heart.
John Zogby from John Zogby Strategy.
I'm a young time.
We tend to have a lot of problems with Republicans on labor rights and how they don't really support workers.
This type of behavior should not be tolerated ever.
They look delicious.
Playing clips of Donald Trump during her rally last night to drive her message in a new way that she believes that she calls him dangerous and unstable.
"And now, with former President Donald Trump found guilty of 34 felony counts, how will his unprecedented criminal conviction affect the upcoming election?"
"I just think sometimes we make assumptions about like communicating who's you know, a lot of times it's portrayed as like this person's the best communicator for this."

"Shit was fucked, bro."
"And like every new president that comes in to office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas."

"And that's why President Trump is trying to talk about it as Kamala Harris flip-flopping and that she can't be trusted on the issue, but also looking at how the Biden-Harris administration has treated the energy industry over the past three and a half years, you know, explicitly moving to end fossil fuels, which of course we know is going to play a huge role in the natural gas industry in the United States."
"That's what we're going to see today, and as well as black voters."
"So that was indicative of how Joe Biden won Pennsylvania, which he must win in order to be president."
"The accident took place at the Highland Festival, one of the biggest rock music festivals in the region, with up to 25,000 attendees."
"Again, Trump lost this poll by one point."
"That same Dick Cheney, you want to align yourself with him."
America doesn't want to go back.
"But yeah, both sides are really just coming in hot with the personal attacks and policy seems to be a distant second here."
"That would get her over 270, 276, she would win."
I'll be an old.
Harris would enforce the law.
"They're struggling industrial towns where Trump needs to maximize his vote, smaller cities that are actually booming with Latino immigrants where Harris wants to make gains."
I'll get your reaction on the other side.
"The states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio will be central to determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election."
"Governor as a prosecutor yourself, the former attorney general, how would you describe the strategy that the vice president employed when asked a question?"
You can't just order a donut?

"Even though we've got the letter admitting that that big tech manipulated the election through face through the FBI and the CIA preemptively, preemptively warning them that there was going to be disinformation that turned out to be real."
You want to take a look at Erie County.
She spoke directly to the people.
"Autocrats begin by vilifying the press, demonizing their and dehumanizing their opponents and co-opting the judiciary."
And that is resonating with voters.
And Donald Trump's influence in many ways is actually growing.
Yeah a little bit There's a lot of black voters a lot of black people going for Trump.
There should be a double digit amount for Trump.
"Her journey from California senator to the second highest office in the land is an inspiration to many, particularly women and minorities who see themselves reflected in her accomplishments."
"No, bro."
"You've seen Republicans in Minnesota go after Democrats for how the, you know, everything that after George Floyd's murder was handled, the rioting and the response, but also attitudes towards police and law enforcement."
They are now separated here by less than a point.
Their concern voters still don't see how she's different than President Biden.
"On the other hand, Harris's supporters emphasize the importance of progressive policies, particularly those aimed at healthcare reform and social equity."
"And look at this in our poll, a 48 percent retrospective approval rating for Trump."

"He will eliminate access to capital for small businesses, especially those owned by minorities."
"These states are crucial to the path to victory for any presidential candidate, and Trump's favorable position in these polls could significantly enhance his chances of winning the presidency."
I highly doubt that's the case.
The companies will dissolve.
It looks like it's going to be closer to 80%.
"But when you look at this, it's a very good sign for Trump."
"I know that people don't like Trump, but I don't have any hatred for him at all."
And the acknowledgement that the Harris-Walls ticket is that forward path is what's really moving people.
I was great.
"And only 16 percent of them want more legal immigration, even though they want 20 plus million people to become citizens with the snap of a finger."
"So when the Democrat candidate starts professing support for Trump, what does that say?"
"What's your betting line here, Mike?"
You can lose everything else.
So maybe I'll take a chance with a guy who's out there.
"For this Suffolk poll here, they're literally rated number one."
"There were some medical incidents, two people for one and then another collapse were being treated."
But look at polls that have come out over the last week or so and what do we see?

"We saw the Secret Service rush the podium when the noises began, move President Trump, former President Trump off the stage, and when he emerged he appeared to have some blood somewhere near one of his ears."

Can I have a little?
"And so I think what she did there was really, really effective."
"Trump flags are visible throughout the county, and in downtown Lancaster, Natasha Collins told us she's no fan of Biden."
You don't need me to tell you we live in what I believe are prophesied times.
"Counties like Luzerne and Erie serve as bellwethers, reflecting broader trends in voter sentiment that can shift dramatically between elections."
"But look, I think as as people go forward and begin to really deliberate about this election, I think they're seeing that difference."
That would be my stance is I'm against it.
I think the woman would.

" I have some breaking news coming out of Butler, Pennsylvania at the Donald Trump presidential election rally in Butler, Pennsylvania."
"I think he'd potentially be better in action because he's somebody who's more malleable, even if he is a grifter."

The second poll was conducted between September 4th and 15th by the Franklin and Marshall College Center for Opinion Research among 890 registered voters.
So I want to share them with you right now.
She's got a problem.
How could you possibly do that now?
Harris plus three.
"Kamala Harris received 48% of the vote and Donald Trump, 51%."
Harris's momentum in Pennsylvania's suburbs and among younger voters provides her with a path to victory.
It's killed cylinder.
"Access to capital is one of the strongest barriers to starting your own small business, and he will eliminate that."
Listen right in the middle.
She should be up by four to five points.
Let's get an idea of how big a crowd is.
And then Trump undercut his lawyer because his lawyer that would also be incriminating him.
She did that at the rally today.
"A quote, the sediment around the whole region is nobody believes that she will not be banned."

What do you ask Vice President Harris?
"So to be anti fracking is kind of like being anti farmer, right?"
And he can keep doing that.
"According to many of the new polls, Harris' lead over Trump has narrowed or vanished completely."
How will this differ from a typical event?
I actually smile when they do it because it's so funny.
They're not going to crack.
"Because here in Erie, they've asked him for a $35,000 payment for the previous rally, which he has ignored."
"By the way, the 9-11 victims are not happy."
But isn't that message getting through to undecided voters concerned about the economy?
Subscribe to the channel.
Very little in return.
"New York Times, Biden plus six."
Not a lot of people saw it.
"And just in general, if we think about it, like that will be the main one to watch on election night."
And so it's going to help Donald Trump in the end and pretty much everything I've seen says that Trump probably is going to sweep all the swing States right now.
It was a joke.
According to this poll 48 47 in Wisconsin.
And I believe that and whether anyone else wants to believe that that's fine.
Well what is swatting?
"Made you stop the traditional reporting in a nonpartisan manner and sort of turned towards opinion Oh, yeah, that's a good question."
That's two right there.
Vance had in that VP debate a few weeks ago.
This consistent result underscores Trump's growing support and positions him as a serious contender in the state.

You know last week there was a bunch of coverage of president former president Barack Obama kind of chiding black men and saying that you know maybe some of you just don't want to see a woman as president.
I question Trump's support at 46 percent.
And so they're getting nervous.
Did they really deviate that much to now overcorrect and now over favor Trump?
Everybody.
And our polling also gives us a read on where voters are on the issues.
"Oh, bless you."
The make cat safe again design.
"Walkers to what that, the significance of that, because I think a lot of people from, from the, from that perspective, don't realize how much of a fail that was, not only for JD Vance, who, who was able to fail onto himself, just a virtue of opening his mouth and existing, but also the campaign to walk into a shop that was, that was not only neutral on him, but kind of openly hostile to the, to the thought of him being there."
This we're looking realistic here.
"For a lot of those Americans, messaging as the, uh, like democratic presidential nominee and messaging for the middle, the middle class and being like, I'm here to help the middle class."
"Either way, my YouTube channel is officially the place to be."
So you are really losing people and leaving them behind at the wayside.
"And you can see still from my vantage point on the other side of this camera, people in tears, people hugging each other, people comforting each other."
They tried to legally persecute the man.
And sometimes I didn't live up to those values and I made mistakes.
"Massive improvements relative to where Biden was, marginal improvements relative to where Kamala Harris was, but all, all, all, all in the right direction."
"So we have to, it would be a significant victory if we can push those Martins down into the sixties."
We don't know.
You're going to hear about the economy.
Trump is going to mention this event in every single fucking appearance moving forward the right is going to make t-shirts and mugs and merchandise out of it he apparently mouthed the word fight so expect to see that picture with some filters on it with the fight thing or some tiktok edits expect for the right to get even more radical because of this event and as more information comes out about whatever happened if this was a shooting and that shooter has any left-wing beliefs at any point I'm talking if they liked AOC's tweak at one point in their life it's fucked because anything that you say against Trump will now be painted as oh they're too radical and look this rhetoric caused yeah.
"I mean, I heard them as some of her strongest remarks, rebuke of what is at stake here, of the threat of Trump to date."
That's an incredible thing.
"But first, I want to play something that former President Obama said thisâ€”last week, I should sayâ€”about this and see what you think of it."
The tallies just did not don't make sense.
He's mad at Howard Stern.
"So when you're playing, it's illegal in most cases under under Trump presidency, it's pre split."
"But if Shapiro is on the ticket, what do you think this means nationally?"
"I know a lot of people, I seen some, I didn't understand."
Polls are showing a dead heat between Harris and Trump nationally.
Let's get down.
Pen emergency physician Dr.
"And in the primary, it was essentially good enough for Republicans there to go through the same exact process without any changes to the law."
They're the generic ballot in the House.
"While reports of anxiety and all-out panic are beginning, and it could have Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign spun up just a few days out from the election as time is running out."
Thank you for watching this video.
She has a history.
"And that is a huge thing for her electability and her odds, because I think this is exactly why you're starting to see Kamala Harris do quite well in these battleground states, do quite well on the national level as well, because the national polls have also shifted."
"And what has happened since the 2020 election when Donald Trump narrowly lost against Joe Biden, lost the state of Pennsylvania, okay?"
No Democrats we spoke to here in battleground Pennsylvania.
"My man Sean Parnell, also a bestselling author and a combat veteran of Afghanistan."
"And I think any politician would be crazy to dismiss the fact that Trump won in 2016, because for one reason he won anyway, was he appealed to those blue collar workers in Midwestern states who feel like their way of life has been eroding and nobody has been doing anything about it."
"And so Latinos down here, they look at that."
"And again, this poll is an exact tie."
"People who were likely going to vote for Joe Biden are now not only voting for Kamala Harris, but they're also taking lawn signs, putting them on their lawn."
So we're just a couple of weeks out from the Democratic National Convention.
"Harris led in five out of the eight polls, with points ranging from one to four."
They have House members who really support aid to Israel.

You can download your games.
And that's something that we couldn't have said a month and a half ago.
Where do I start?
So he has to drag her down.
"No, but Chester County is a good example."
"Even Trump Republicans, as Laura mentioned, are responding quickly."
We're not reading the articles here.
Because together we've got a chance to choose a new generation of leadership in this country and start building a better and stronger and fairer and more hopeful America.
"Demographically speaking, this is a state that should go for Trump by like five points at the bare minimum."
"And when you have Democrats coming out with anxiety, leaking to publications on the state, Pennsylvania Democrats, national Democrats, it usually is a sign that there's some nerve-wracking appetites happening in the campaign."
"And he's, you know, more popular in terms of net favorables."
"Thank you, Congressman Jolly."
"If Donald Trump or JD Vance really says something so outrageously offensive, that could drive me to vote for vice president Harris, but it's, it's highly unlikely."
"I agree a lot with what Chip was saying about, you know, these questions."
"And by the way, we did it on a bipartisan basis."
"Hey, man, I hope this is the tide turns."
The problem is if Pennsylvania goes Democrat.
What happened there was they had a law in Pennsylvania where they couldn't count the mail in an absentee votes until election day.
"Which is the whole point of what's going on here because as politically, a political analyst would say, it is the undecided people who will decide the direction Pennsylvania goes."
"I'm not saying he's, but I say that I am much better looking than her."
"Senator Bob Casey, of course, is running for reelection in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
What is middle class like 75K?
And take a guess who these polls are.
"But look, we will see I'm optimistic."
Then he'll stop saying these things.
"But if you look at the legislature, it's the only state in the country where Democrats have one chamber and Republicans have the other."

33 million.
Here with us is bakery owner Kathleen Loshall.
Really appreciate it.
We'll leave no doubt about who we are and what America stands for and together we'll keep building a country that's more fair and more equal and more just and more free.
Kamala Harris is doing two points at least worse than Hillary Clinton was eight years ago.
Who says that?
Pennsylvania has quite a few of them.
Democrats have something to do with assassination attempts.
"They offered her the best deal of all, which is dropping the charges again, incredibly rare."
He did very very well in Macomb County and I think that's a very good sign for things to come in Michigan and it shows that Biden doesn't have a lot of support in the key places that he needs to go out there and win in order to win this election.
"And then this guy, this Ryan Routh or Ruth, however you pronounce it, this guy was all over Ukraine."
The October 15th deadline is fast approaching and time is running out.
They tried to kidnap her Okay She's a good-looking woman None of us are gonna mind looking at her for eight years at all.
"You may as well, you might as well just don't, don't even vote."
Let's pause here for a second.
So Donald Trump will be in a Philly suburb later today.
"With Florida now no longer considered a true swing state, Pennsylvania has become the largest electoral prize among 2024's battlegrounds, which also makes it the most likely tipping point state in this election."
It's things like the economy.
He's just not right.
He's over the top.
"OK, then Asian."
"The VPs visit here, leaving a lasting impact."
"What do you wish, based on what you've heard tonight, that Carson and Faith understood about you, your side?"
Like she like I she could win.
"Well, we're running out of time here."
It looks like John Wick is also a pollster.
"Read stuff from different news outlets, even ones you think you might disagree with."
 Total running time for each presidential candidate after tonight's heated Harris Trump debate wrapped up a little while ago from President Trump Speaking just under 43 minutes Vice President Harris speaking just over 37 and a half minutes Plus we just got the first results from our incident poll a debate watchers stand by for that.
"I'm the biggest trout in the pod, and I'm the biggest trout in me."
And what sounds like he's saying he's going to vote for Trump.
"Olivia Jung â€“ $2,500,000 Olivia Jung, a pharmaceutical tycoon, has contributed $2.5 million to Harris' campaign."
"They they they just Disappeared into the abyss gone, you know, and he says I'll post this here because all the comments are hidden On your most recent video and I want to make that clear to people out there as well There's been times in the past like shout out brendan."
And that's the kind of in your face politics that is identified with the Trump movement that I think also alienates people.
"And at that point, you can win anything."
"Again, God bless him and his family."
We have a lot of topics we want to get to.
"In fact, she's doing a media blitz like we've been talking about this week, focused on black media to try to pull in those voters, Major, because again, it is that enthusiasm that could make or break this election when you're talking about who wakes up and goes to the polls."
"Oh, my God, dude."
"And for those that are saying, well, Democrats going to vote more on Election Day."
"The private polling, basically the same thing, actually a bit more friendly to Trump."
"Energy workers say nobody believes what she said, and rightfully so."
"OK, now it's starting to look."
"I mean, in the sense that given the way our electoral college is structured, Kamala Harris needs to be at least three and a half to four percentage points ahead of Donald Trump because of the popular vote, she gets a lot of extra votes, popular votes in California and Illinois and New York, large states."
Put down your phone and vote.
We'll cross that bridge when we get there.
"And yeah, I guess I have a few years on me covering elections over the last three decades, one way or the other."
But this is not what the polls the polls are saying right now.
"And that's critical because, let's face it, whoever wins Pennsylvania more than likely is gonna win the presidency."
I want him to finish here.
I'm excited for Kamala.
Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged.
"The fire started on one gondola, which then spread to a second one."
"I mean, it's not just shaping the conversation."
The focus groups after the debate were we still didn't hear anything.
"Immigration is second or third, I should say."
That will do it for today's video.
What are people yelling behind you?
"So we sat down with three of his staunchest supporters in Allentown, Pennsylvania, this week, to see what drives their devotion to the former president."
"Here in Harrisburg, Harrisburg, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where Trump is about to take the stage 6pm."
But it's also about what happened down at his golf course on September 15th.
"He uses Latinos poor Trump, right?"
"By the way, we got millions of more votes in 20 that we did 16."
"Yes, come here."
"Time and time again, the state polling misses incredibly to the left."
"That poor cat was watching the local news like, This is mortified."
"Clearly, they don't share those concerns today."
And so we will start to see more and more money go into that.
And I don't play around with the constitution.
"We delayed, I think, one weapons shipment to them because we were mad."
"My husband is, Doug, you are doing so much and you've been traveling all over our country and I want to thank you."
You try and share my screen here.
There were four pollsters that dropped Harris leads.
"It means that you're already at a majority and that people just moving over narrowly between now and the election can put you over that majority denying any chance that Donald Trump would win by a plurality, vote splitting, whatever it might be."
That was some some weird stuff in the Trump event.
That's where my wife grew up.
He wants everybody to dislike each other.
"Hillary Clinton won it by just 2,700 votes in 2016."
How can that be?
"He's very much about governing and less about idealistic, that ideological politics."
"Now, Pennsylvania has been a tricky one for Democrats."
Some of these counties feeling left behind?
Or you expected to be about the same?
But here's the deal.
Are they even worth paying attention to or are they just going to make us more anxious?
And it just seems that the appearance looks like he's abandoning his voters to go after these Republican voters.
"And if I'm savin 50 a gallon, that's groci what I'm looking at what ago."
And I'm not entirely sure Dr. Oz does that and the guy's got a lot of controversial statements in his past surrounding a wide variety of things.
"But no, he came back."
Twice Donald Trump was asked a simple answer in the words of the moderator.
"I don't exactly know what the issue was there, but still looking at the big picture when it comes down to it, Trump is leading in Pennsylvania."
"That's what stood out to me, Sean, was it felt like incompetence to try and make this an issue after the way we withdrew from Afghanistan."
"OK, now it's oh yeah, this is a Harris point five already."
Didn't comment about complaints about Liu.
It's over for Harris.
"In addition, the governor discussed the legislative achievements that Democrats had achieved over the course of the previous five years and contrasted them with what he referred to as Trump's broken promises."
They've got internal polling data now that says they might even be tied.
He's voted for a series of things that have made our Commonwealth much worse.
It's all over the place.
"No, I just said Joe left the first day of the DNC and then the Obama showed up the next day."
"Meanwhile, Harris and her future running mate will travel together across the country next week, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News."
We also know she ran against Madeline Dean a Democratic member of Congress in suburban Philadelphia lost by 30 which that's what you're going to do in 2018 against was was it 2018 or 2020.
A Biden supporter has broken in to the Trump rally.
"Alright, that's all for today's update."
"If the trajectory of the race though remains roughly stable, I would expect Trump to win Pennsylvania."
Harris receives 51% among the likely voters.
"Like in Easton, where Jackie Kroll today is watching her grandson."
"And our legislature should pass legislation that would require that to happen, as many states do."
"Next, an Emerson College poll conducted from September 27 to 28 with a sample of 1,000 likely voters shows Harris leading Trump by one point, with both candidates polling at 49%."
Pennsylvania's voters can't seem to decide.
He's got the Trump Bible.
This requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges their struggles while promoting a forward-looking agenda that addresses economic and social issues in a meaningful way.
So viewed as a must win swing state in the path to the White House.
"We fought together, we have endured together, we have pushed onward together and right here in Pennsylvania we have bled together."
I'm gonna show that in a little bit when it comes to her.
"And again, this is the most radical climate agenda we've ever seen that no one's talking about."
And MSNBC viewers by far say that abortion is their number one issue when presented with this massive list.
Joe Biden delivered funding for that.
"And that is just a bad phrasing, right?"
"Now, what the electoral votes are, what is going to decide this election?"
"But again, CNN is done with her garbage."
"And, yeah, it was just it was awesome to meet a former president and especially Donald Trump."
And also this came out in statistics.
"Then you then I think you have to then say, Yeah, but what about character?"
"Well, they don't show up in polls, but they show up and they are generally trending against Donald Trump."
"Kamala already worked with Joe Biden to take on the drug companies, bring down the cost of insulin, hearing aids, more than 50 prescription drugs."
"Still, 49-49, it's a nail biter here, and it's not quite clear what's happening."
"So you know, that's the work I did at AG."
This most iconic rally to come to.
"She was anti fracking in twenty nineteen and we all know that's still her stance, no matter what she says now."
The state court is halting enforcement of a requirement that voters include accurate handwritten dates on envelopes used to submit mail-in ballots.
"It also provides a strong talking point for Trump and his allies as they campaign across the country, emphasizing their focus on securing the electoral process."
That really have sent them into a tailspin.
"I think what we've seen from 2016 and his experience over the last eight years as president and also as non-president now, I think the one thing they're looking for more than anything else is loyalty."
Harris is riding a big wave of momentum to the Democratic DNC there.
You're not going to come over here.
"It's like 1.7 Harris lead in terms of the net average, according to real clear politics."
" all right so Kamala Harris had a sit-down interview with a local station and they asked her about her economic plan and she basically repeated the same thing that she always says the interviewer wanted to get some details on her economic plan so she says that well I'm from the middle class and blah blah blah blah opportunity economy blah blah blah blah I was gonna actually react to it right here but I'm just so sick of her saying the exact same thing it's ridiculous it's pretty pathetic at this point she's gonna give $25,000 new homeowner home buyers which makes those first of all where's this tax credit gonna come from where are they gonna find the money for all this and even if they do okay let's say you give away $25,000 to somebody who's looking to buy a home or whatever okay well then if you're selling a home if you're selling a home naturally you're gonna raise the price of the home by $25,000 because you now know that this person has access to $25,000 from the government anyway she says she wants to build 3,000 new homes or apartments or whatever okay yeah how are you actually gonna do that you know it's just really embarrassing at this point she can only perform on a really controlled environments which made the debate really frustrating obviously the moderators supported her as much as they could attack Trump as much as they could Trump's still fail to just expose her but I'm not gonna dwell on that we still have a little more time to go in this campaign and it's pretty obvious that she has nothing new to offer as far as a plan she just repeats what she's been coached to say and that's all we're really dealing with here so she gets into the White House who's actually gonna be running the show seriously but she have any ability to actually do this job she talked about her economic plan she has no experience whatsoever running large organizations companies corporations or anything governments even she was an attorney attorney general of California prosecutor in San Francisco she became a US senator but I mean where's a real practical experience actually running large organizations the answer is she doesn't have any and she doesn't really need any because she's not gonna be running this show so there you go thanks for watching thanks for listening and don't forget the future belongs those who bear for today and speaking of the election there has been some good news as far as the election is not all gloom and doom as far as World War three and all this other stuff there are has been a ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and it's really good news for Trump essentially they're saying that mail-in ballots without correct dates will not be counted so you can't be submitting mail-in ballots without the right dates so some good news right there they have to have some type of standards put in place and let me say this one more time about elections you cannot have a situation where it takes three days to count the damn votes the system loses all credibility system loses all credibility when that happens and going back to the world situation with Ukraine the problem with the Ukraine using long range missiles given to them by the US and UK is that they need satellite satellite technology they don't have the technology and expertise actually utilize these long range missiles without direct involvement from NATO that means the United States means to UK and if they're in a situation where they're they get to okay from the United States and UK NATO to actually use these long range missiles in Russia Russia's there Putin is saying that it means that Russia is gonna be a war with NATO now what does that really mean does that mean they're gonna the Russian Navy is gonna take on the US Navy the US has the best Navy I say that much it doesn't mean nuclear weapons is I mean tactical weapon tactical tactical nukes been used throughout Europe what does that really mean that's the question I do know this Putin has set red lines before and they don't has crossed them over and over again so at this point does anybody in London and Washington really take Russia seriously do they take Putin seriously now right now the Washington is sort of pulling back with this idea we've seen this in the past where somebody in Europe or suggest a let's do cross this red line and Washington says well I don't know about that but then later on it come around say well okay go ahead and do it we've seen this pattern play out over and over and now Putin is saying that a if you cross this red line we know we will consider NATO to be directly involved in this conflict what is it what what what exactly will be the consequences what is Russia gonna do I mean that's the big question there's talk that maybe Russia can do a demonstration of a nuclear test they haven't done that since 1990 I don't think that's gonna be effective in deterring NATO because at this point a lot of people in NATO believe that a Russia is gonna do anything all right this is to say the world we have a presidential election where it's pretty obvious that we're in big trouble we're in very big trouble that's if we don't end up in World War three before then so do your best to take care of yourself take care of your family I wanted to range today enjoy that and I'll forget the future belongs to those who prepare for today"
"He's brain damaged, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"And now all of a sudden Trump has endorsed Dr. Oz and you've got somebody who's taking the birtherism and the and the and Obama's a Muslim and all this crazy stuff, which YouTube monitors."
Just to go back to the election there.
And it's not like they don't have strong allies in Pennsylvania.
So it's like OK.
Kamala doesn't give a frack about you.
"Danny, good morning."
"But if we go down here, we could see Insider Advantage is one of the worst."
"And while he was trying to make inroads with women, he is getting some pushback for comments that he made during that town hall where he said that I am the father of IVF."
Joel?
You deserve an explanation.
This is just footage of them.
"Now, while the Democrats do have their work cut out for them, I think they are in the position of advantage."
"Yes, abortion is in there somewhere, but it's not as important of an issue as it was in 2022, which again, you had a lot of gubernatorial races."
Watch and listen.
But she wants just factual information.
They're showing Trump up.
We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.
61% were graduates.
But it's all about the margins in Trump countries.
" Alright man, so we got some absolutely huge news here for the Kamala Harris campaign."
"If you say, Well, I'm mad about higher prices."
And to the right you have more division and then to the left you have reconciliation.
"Kamala Harris currently holds a razor-thin lead over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, leading by just 0.8 points in 538's polling average."
"They kept saying, when are you going to McDonald's?"
Love you all.
"I mean, what you're seeing is the enthusiasm for the vice president in Kamala Harris."
"He says, Kamala's face."
And some of them may be discouraged from getting the help they need.
It felt as though personal excellence was under attack.
"As we consider it, what Joe was talking about, this notion that we're seeing changes in the way voters feel about the economy or how the economy would fare under these candidates and Harris more favorably."
There is going to be a gender gap.
You have certainly heard people who do not like Donald Trump.
"I mean, since we've seen the debate, which was actually just less than two months ago, a month and a half ago, even prior to that, we saw that Joe Biden was starting to drop in the polls, starting to drop in support, the uncommitted vote started to get higher, the amount of democratic sentiment that was pushing away from the party was getting higher."
That's over 40 years ago.
Everyone's voting.
"So I don't know if Gallup updated their overall party identification, because remember they had it Republicans plus three."
Thank you so much.
"It's a key battleground, but it's becoming increasingly Republican."
"I mean, it used to be we'd have arguments about tax policy or foreign policy."
And IVF you had mentioned before IVF.
" Sloth, you're gonna live with me now."
You don't see that everywhere.
And you look at where the numbers stand in those races right now.
"Right now we have 16 million jobs added, 16 million jobs added."
Why is that important to you?
Now he appears to have earned a lot of national political capital in the last few weeks as well.
So I'm happy happy story.
And that's the difference.
They've moved right.
Think back to Super Storm Sandy in 2012 and the closing days of that presidential election.
Couple of things here that really strike you.
"Harris' campaign is calling for another debate, but Trump, who previously insisted on multiple debates, is now noncommittal."
"So I think it's gonna come down to the wire, come down to that, get out the vote and come down to the exhausting last few weeks of the campaign."
"Then when Hurricane Helene came to visit, they all signed a letter asking President Biden for federal funding."
We had about 34 percent left in the car.
That's what people think that this is just a real person and he wasn't really trying to be mean or nothing like that because he gave her a compliment right afterward.
No.
"She had a really sort of burst of momentum, you know, through her coalescing that support through the DNC, the Democratic National Convention, where she officially took officially became the nominee through the debate."
Now I don't know if you're there.
This is the first batch presidential fries.
Harris finished 2 points ahead of Trump in this poll.
"He was talking about radical liberal people here in this country that set off a lot of alarm bells, not only on the left, but throughout the political world, hearing him talking about using the military potentially on American citizens."
Are you happy with that answer?
They don't like the Medicaid program.
"Of course, they're fighting back."
Let's take a listen to what what was said there.
And they very rarely agree with each other.
"It seems like basic, conservative, common sense to me."
"I'm Claude McDaniel, and this is Streaming News Network."
He's flipping all these counties.
"In fact, Hillary Clinton had like a nine-point lead in October in the state."
I've been very critical of him.
What are you going to do if you're president?
I also asked the press secretary about Trump vowing to name Elon Musk the head of a new government efficiency commission at a time when some experts have been raising concerns that this could be a conflict of interest because Elon Musk's companies have a lot of government contracts with these government agencies and that role could actually give them the power to regulate those very agencies that hold sway over his companies.
One of Donald Trump's top surrogates also posted the following.
Their poll was Biden plus seven.
We're a big staple.
"Advocates say that it could prevent the US citizenship pronunciation, which occurs partly due to this complex tax regulation."
I'm not defending.
But nine out of ten Harris voters say that they are.
"Yeah, true."
I've heard it many different ways at this point.
"If Joe Biden stepped aside and they had a free for all, do you think she would be the nominee when talking to grassroots Democrats across the state?"
Maybe even the credit card tips.
I'm sure for it's over.
Democrats take them for granted.
We were fighting with Trump.
"Plus one even, Redfield and Emerson."
So we're going to talk about it.
"CBS News election survey executive director Anthony Salvanto explained earlier today, there is one factor contributing to how close this race is."
"And of course, folks like myself thought that she should take Josh Shapiro, of course as the governor of the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
Now he is here in Pennsylvania over the weekend.
He's always been a supporter of the channel And you know what's so wild is he left a lot of comments in the yt system with flagging a man.
It's true for most voters in Pennsylvania.
So she was brought on to help win over those voters.
There's a lot of focus on your state.
"Nancy Cook and Sabrina Rodriguez, that's not your problem."
I think they're every six minutes.
"And I think that's exactly what these polls are revealing, that the true margin right now is somewhere around Kamala Harris being up by one to two points in the state."
"Now, let's pause for a moment and talk about our testosterone."
This was the first time we really had heard from Musk in public on behalf of Trump.
Important role.
He has failed the test as commander in chief before.
They say Hannibal Lecter.
The race is still too close to call and the Harris campaign is deploying its big guns to help seal the deal.
Hmm.
Explain it to the folks in Atlanta driving to work.
You're fucked.
"So whether if you have children or not, you know, like..."
That's a what is that a seven-point shift from 2016 compared to the polling average.
"And that is substantial because Kamala Harris being ahead in Pennsylvania goes to show that her level of electability really boils down to the Sunbelt and the Rust Belt, the exact two regions that Kamala Harris was needed the most."
If the polling on real clear politics shows Kamala Harris is losing.
Where's the you know where people just repeating what happened and putting it on on?
"And you know, those are the two front runners."
 What's your name?
"Called on election night, no consideration in these battleground states, Trump was in it to win it."
"Well, let's be clear."
The significance of this poll lies not only in the close numbers but also in the broader context of voter sentiment in Pennsylvania.
I have to.
I don't think the Phillies are going to win.
And what we do know is that Donald Trump leads in these two counties by 1%.
"Both campaigns will likely pour significant resources into the state, knowing that its 20 electoral votes could be the deciding factor in the race to 270."
Because we shouldn't ban fracking.
They just don't want to go back to the chaos of the Trump years.
But I just want to start with the vice president's remarks.
We have to understand that Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet are not looking to end this conflict.
"Yep, that's absolutely right."
Let's talk about what that creator said about the polls and let's talk a little bit about what Trump getting shot at is going to do.

"I think once again, it's safe to say that in 2024, Pennsylvania will determine this election."
"And then after that, switched and voted to form President Trump in 2016 before going back to President Biden in 2020."
It was a packed weekend for Donald Trump.
The variation in polling data across different areas reflects the state's diverse political landscape.
I blame his failed policies.
There's too much money and momentum behind fracking as an industry.
That's why We are supporting him.
"In the Redfield and Wilton strategies poll also conducted between September 16th and 19th, we see another tie with Harris and Trump each securing 47%."
"Zach, what can you tell us about the particular stops the campaigns are making today and what it reveals about their strategies?"
"The vast majority of people in Georgia said no, even though statistically it's somewhat close, not that wages have overstripped and compensated in all respects for inflation, but it's much closer than people perceive."
Now we have some new polling data out of Michigan.
But it was confused for some reason where we were.
So you got a home in the Philly suburbs and you got a home on the Eastern shore.
It's perfect.

Don't worry.
"Pennsylvania is seen as pivotal for both sides, $500 million in TV ads."
"Today, we spoke with voters who are mostly in favor of a Harris-Shapiro ticket, while others just want the governor to finish out leading the Commonwealth."
And so I'm here today to announce some of the work that we have all been doing together over many years that is righting this wrong because I think we all believe that every person in America has a right to clean water and yet today across our nation for far too many Americans that right is under threat for a variety of reasons.
Libertarian candidate.
Making sure their voices are heard.

 President Biden and former President Trump won their respective primaries in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday.
"He, of course, grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania."

That's the job.
"The contrast is clear and I'll tell you what, I would much rather be us than them."
"I don't know how much effect it would actually have among Catholic voters but It is interesting to look at this so America's second Catholic president was visiting his child and neighbor in April and He's like, I'm Joe Biden."
Democrats had their best polling on average in August.
The relationship between personal liberty and family values is one in which the roles are reversed.
"You got Romney, Liz Cheney."
Rally's over.
"And in North Carolina last night, Vice President Harris took aim at Trump's debate performance, highlighting his promise to get rid of the Affordable Care Act."
Trump will conduct diplomacy.

"So if she was to nominate him to be the VP, that would probably hurt her more nationally, even if it would give her a bit of a boost in Pennsylvania, which is probably why they selected the Kami teacher, quote unquote, from Minnesota by way of Nebraska and Tim Walts."

"Ryan Bowyer, who as the first blackhead of the city's building trades council, one of the most powerful labor leaders in the state, this guy says, I have concerns about Nikki Liu."
He hardly played at all on three seasons.

President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution.
"No, that's certainly a lesson that we keep teaching ourselves and America every cycle."
"Harris, in her bid to win over white voters, has worked tirelessly to reshape her image and bridge the gap on key issues, particularly fracking."
"The Trump campaign said its goal is to quote prosecute Kamala Harris, dangerously liberal record."
"I think that for Kamala Harris, her lane is not only being the younger pressure candidate out here, but it's also being able to galvanize voters who in all honesty had stepped outside of politics, who didn't want to hear the bickering, who did not want to see two super seniors running against each other, who wanted to see a path to a future, not a look back to the past."
"So Bill Clinton is coming out and endorsing Trump, basically."
"The question is, is it going to be by enough to win?"
I've decided.
What exactly do we have to show for those wars?
That's part of it.
I think we have to get control of the media.
The thing that I've always given Trump credit for is I felt that he understood marketing.
"The less Biden there is, the better off she's going to be."
And hard to see president being reelected if he can't win all three of those states.
"And first and foremost, Republicans are blaming Biden for this."
So here's the first question for you.
59% said employment would be lower.
And that should tell you everything you need to know about the Senate race.

It was not a toss up when Joe Biden was still in it.
A historically Republican leaning group.
The Detroit economic one.
This is critical when it comes to midterm elections but also presidential elections.
"Now, he's obviously been in Pennsylvania a lot and Trump is somewhat kind of omnipresent and he's never off your TV."
We also know these different kinds of things about what's going on with Kamala Harris being proactive as opposed to reactive.
What are the most important issues for you?
So the target here today is on those voters.
" Well, the focus today is on the state of Pennsylvania."
"So Jake, let me begin with you, the Trump campaign this morning."
"In a recent Guardian interview, Moore predicted that Trump could falter under pressure, possibly resulting in unpredictable behavior on live TV."
"I mean, he was supposed to be the door campaign."
So basically the debate was what?
I've had conversations with some individuals who feel that not voting at all because of the apathy that they feel and the demonstration that all the work that's happened over the last 11 months has led to nothing.
"Oh, I don't know."
He'd have a sizable lead in Pennsylvania.
"You would, right?"
"It's not only her agenda, I think, it's who she is, who her values are, and whether they are comfortable with her as president."
"All right, well, we will see how it all plays out in three weeks, Rachel Baidar."
"Terry, forgive me, we have a little bit of breaking news that I just want to get in here, which is that before he took that stage behind you, former President Trump did an interview with Fox News and he gave his clearest answer yet on how he would vote on his home state's ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights into that state constitution and essentially repeal a current Florida state law that bans abortions after six weeks, which is before most women know that they are pregnant."
"She dropped out in 2019 December, well before primaries and everything got kicked off."
The back and forth over medical records is ramping up again.
"Yeah, this is Pennsylvania, not a deep red or deep blue state."
We have the motivation and the grassroots passion for a ground game.
"But there's a lot of doom and gloom from a lot of people, even on the right, about this election."
U.S. Steel should remain American owned and American operated.

"I mean, it's going to be too expensive for number one, for somebody to buy a house."
The final Pennsylvania Senate debate between Democrat Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick happens live tonight on 6 ABC.
"And so the 0.5% advantage here, while not certainly as impressive as Biden's plus six points in 2020, Hillary Clinton's even seven point advantage after the convention, we are finding that Kamala Harris is rebounding, especially relative to Biden, who again, when he dropped out, was down three points nationally."
I'm curious how that strikes your ears.
"I mean, I think that the results of this next election will probably sway that scale, but I really like what you said about choosing to have hope."
And not just any votes.
You know what the problem is?
"If you look at the product of the work of Democrats in recent years, they're speaking to those folks in a way that I think, you know, frankly, we maybe weren't doing a few years ago, but we are doing now."
"Mr. Pittsburgh, how are you?"
"Crime also usually pops up, but these have been fairly crime abortion as well."
Make sure you stay up to date on the latest breaking news and all things Midas by signing up to the Midas Touch newsletter at MidasTouch.com slash newsletter.
"Yeah, it's great."
Trump then talks about how he's been accused of throwing hamburgers on the wall.
I couldn't.
"Asma, let's switch gears here."
"You know, it's hard to know the lasting effects on that town, on this country, when it comes to Trump's words, the ways that he often dehumanizes, demonizes immigrants."
It's not like he's leading it just in Trafalgar or Rasmussen or like insider advantage with some right leading pollster that ended up being wrong in 2022.
"I told my buddy, he said, I'll never vote for Donald Trump."
"In fact, there are seven key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada."
"Yes, it is possible that a state like Minnesota could flip the Trump at the end of the day or a state like Maine at large."
And we're expected to say these issues that are fall secondary.
"Around Pittsburgh, those efforts include debate watch parties and voter registration events, and distributing candidate information to high school and college campuses."
They will take a topic and then they will compare coverage of the topic across different biased sources.
And they've installed something into her just like they do with the liberal people with the chip.
"And I'm not sure how this question got here, but are you enjoying your momentary rain as the best team in the NFC East while the Giants regain their footing?"
And he'll never support the Protecting the Right to Organize Act to protect working men and women so you can organize the union.
What do you think we're going to see?
Will there be a five point miss?
We've reached the point of the campaign where her emails are making me feel like I'm going through a breakup.
George Stephanopoulos here.
Trump t shirt.
I think there's gonna be a big turnout every place.
Kind of can't blame her actually when you think about it.
"And after he was rushed off the stage with blood in his face, a spokesperson said Trump is fine and this is a heinous act."
"And if Trump's in a good position here, for starters, he's probably up in other swing states, but he's probably gonna win the presidency if he's winning Pennsylvania."
But here's where things get interesting.
Okay it's cooked as of like an hour ago what appeared to be gunshots rang out at a Trump rally he went down he got back up his ear and his face appeared to be bloody and he's doing a fist pump in the air.
And it certainly is.
Probably and did you have forum in 2016 or 2020?
The Trump led by five.
Okay so this is the state of Pennsylvania and these are all of their counties and congressional districts so what you see with all of these little kind of jaggedy lines and everything these are the boundaries around each of the counties so here's here here here here here here here here and so forth.
"One guy says, I think that it makes you feel upset."
"In a related context, Donald Trump, during an interview with Musk, reiterated his belief that the Ukraine invasion would not have occurred under his presidency, while simultaneously calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky honorable despite past controversies."
"Stay home, bum."
"However, the Pennsylvania or the Wisconsin polls happen getting closer."
"Because they know the public is complete fatigue from hearing, first of all, climate emergencies, climate crisis, and all the nonsense."
"Pennsylvania holds 19 electoral votes, more than any other battleground state."
"Now Trump is always undercounted, but still."
We have video here.
"She'll give first-time homebuyers up to $25,000 to help them with a down payment."
"So I was sitting here with my colleagues, Shari Williams and Ilya Garcia, both candidates, David McCormick and Senator Bob Casey left the room about 15 minutes ago, and you could feel the tension drop significantly."
"As a democracy, we know there's a duality to the nature of democracy."
Stay informed.
I just don't think you're going to see Harris Harris point miss.
"It wasn't by a huge margin and it was close, but he did win."
"So already a three-point swing, it's reasonable to believe now with three weeks of campaigning with a VP selection with millions of dollars poured into advertising and marketing and funding, that Pennsylvania is far more democratic."
That's for sure.
"And let me tell you something, Nora."
"Everyone is throwing their hat in the ring, making this one of the most dynamic elections we've seen in a while."
"I don't know what the equivalent would be in Australia, but if you picked a traditional sort of liberal seat and then have labor spend a lot of time there, that's what Kamala Harris is doing in Georgia."
It's unfair.
"You said something that interested me, which is Donald Trump cares about me."
Is that what motivates you?
And so they're going to continue to try to distract and and and and denigrate.
That's the whole DeSantis versus Newsome thing.
And I think that's also why we're starting to see some numbers here.
I'm a transgender person.
They're not dying.
You had a Republican mayor and John Giles who said what I think everyone in Arizona is thinking.
"Unfortunately, that was under his administration."
"And that's kind of what uh, obama is saying And before we close it out too."
And so I think what you see here are some of the same things you see elsewhere.
"I don't know if this is the CIA from everything I'm reading that this is a Trump's, excuse me, a Biden supporter, somehow got in with a firearm 10 shots fired."
"Vice President Harris has been replaying some of former President Trump's words that he's used at his rallies and in certain interviews that indicate that he would use the military, for example, to go after his political opponents or leftists."
Lose four or five pounds.
"Oh, right."
"They're, they're diets, they're family, the children are well behaved, the work ethics there."
And every title is weird.
"Yes, the same pollster that back in 2020 claimed Trump is gonna win Wisconsin by 17 points."
This is a tough state to compete in and win in.
Do you think he's losing Wisconsin or even Michigan at that point?
I've seen him play like three downs.
"And so it'll encourage more donations, more enthusiasm, more volunteers, more energy, because it shows the tightening of the race."
"In August, Harris received 50 percent of the vote and Trump received 47 percent."
"But when she was running for president back in 2019, she agreed that a total fracking ban was necessary."
I don't think there will be any guardrails.
"Be it Vice President Harris or former President Trump, I want to understand electoral politics that we have at play."
It's with a guy who's actually lucid enough to not hit the nuclear button.
"On the RCP average right now, Trump is up by two points."
You can see the difference at this point.
The two assassination attempts that we know of so forth.
"Well, Caroline, thank you so much for joining us and we'll be right back."
"But these two places, they have gone on opposite corners."
That that's what they found.
Both candidates will make the case for why they are better either now or better four years ago.
Beautiful.
"In Scranton, Taylor Proppolar's Spectrum News."
Oh my.
"I mean, Pennsylvania, you've also passed to make sure legislation makes sure that kids are fed in PA. Universal free breakfast."
But I do believe art and comedy and music that is the engine driving these topics to the surface.
I'll give you a little secret.
"Yeah, we're monetized here."
Okay.
"When you get the Medal of Honor, generally speaking, and I've met many of them and I've seen the families of many of them."
"And, you know, I was thinking, why is he kind of going after New York?"
"And I think as Reuben mentioned, you need to make a plan."
Hell has frozen over officially.
"One Democrat said, I feel like we're going to win here, but we're going to win in spite of Harris's campaign, says Pennsylvania is such a mess and it's incredibly frustrating."
"So there's just really no justification for what 538 is doing here other than, oh, we're going to placate our liberal audience and kind of just pacify them, especially after this came out, because if you're up in Pennsylvania in this poll, you're up in Pennsylvania."
"So A, Pennsylvania is very much in play."
"How is that possible, Kamala?"
"As Secretary of State, Schmidt is doing everything he can between now and election day to assure residents their votes will count and to take on the lies Trump continues to spread about Pennsylvania."
"And in a scenario like that, the margins really do matter."
What are you hearing?
It's for women.
And there was some policy in there.
Trump sitting plus point three.
"The vice president's going to Detroit and then Pittsburgh, where I am later this afternoon."
"Or do I trust Quinnipiac, the New York Times, Suffolk, Franklin and Marshall?"
This rollout went about as well as any campaign could have hoped for.
So I know that you were Walts' roommate back in college.
He won by over eight.
"Then in 92, some people wanted Bill Clinton to pick Jesse Jackson."
"Blake believes that Harris' approach to addressing the educational disparities in America will create opportunities for underserved populations, making her a strong supporter of Harris' presidential bid."
With some the polls showing Trump's actually having a small lead.
"So if ED is getting you down, it's time to change that."
And here's here's something I'd like to talk about.
And it is really hard to see.
"So really, really good news for the Kamala Harris campaign."
"So they really do need to make inroads, top Democrats."
Their final poll was Biden plus seven.
What is this?
So is it now a fake poll or maybe just maybe the theory that there's been a response bias in polling is true.
He never led down the stretch back in 2016.
"With less than a month until election day, new polls show the two candidates virtually tied in this critical swing state."
 Republican strategist Matt Clink.
Jesse.
"You know, I think that that's definitely something that applies to your college age voters."
"Do you expect there's gonna be a big shift in the polls between now and November five, or is it going to stay as close as it is at the moment?"
And I want to play that part for our audience.
"Does anybody, would anybody like to keep red meat?"
A lot of times the party out of power is more motivated to vote.
He's got the core states that he held in 2020 plus North Carolina so far in his column.
"And abortion was the top response, 22 percent, above immigration, above cost of living even."
"Yeah, that's right."
This would be a disaster for Pennsylvania.
So it's not a surprise to me that he would want to stay and continue this work.
People were dying.
"He criticized her record on immigration crime and gun control, accusing her of failing the American people."
We're going to make our country get this is going to be I want this to be a really important evening.
So this has been an honor tonight.
"Now, when it comes to the debate, the former president has been having some informal policy sessions, his advisors tell us."
Be happy.
People on set see a different side of me than when I'm at home or when I'm like alone with my guitar and things like that.
But is he favored in all of them?
Both the Trump and Harris campaigns are looking to court voters in the state's so-called Latino belt.
"If Joe Biden was leading the polls in every single swing state, some swing states that, you know, Democrats didn't even win last time, and he was up by, let's say, five points in some of them, there's no universe that Trump would even be a 20% favorite, yet they make Biden the outright favorite even if it is by a narrow margin."
"For me, I miss it so much down there in South Florida."
They're going to shift heavily towards Trump.
Any reason that that doesn't work in Pennsylvania for Mehmet Oz?
"Again, you have one out of Rasmussen."
"I mean, do you see a strategy to the way he's campaigning?"
"President Trump, especially work more days at McDonald's and Kamala."
Get off your couch and vote.
Is that is that really crazy to say?
"And of course that in and of itself is a misrepresentation, because a lot of those people, number one, you had hospitals that were incentivized to label every death as a COVID death due to insurance."
"And it's just I mean, it'll happen again."
"And when it comes to a state like Pennsylvania where Trump is expanding his lead, it's just common sense."
"For Harris, high turnout in Philadelphia, coupled with strong performance in the suburbs, would provide a significant advantage."
"Pennsylvania is going to be a dog fight, a pure dog fight."
He calls her maggot Hagerman.
"Instead of the expected stops in swing states, Trump is holding rallies in solidly blue states like California, Colorado, Illinois, and New York, places where he's losing by a margin wider than his pants."
"But at the same time, look at some of these things that we do measure."
It blew the roof off the stadium where the rays play.
"When you think about where Kamala Harris was really improving support on for, compared to Joe Biden, minority voters, specifically black voters, in some of the polls that we saw with Biden in Pennsylvania, he was losing ground from black voters compared to 2020."
"I spoke to a child, a young girl who crossed the border with her mother when she was six years old and she had been separated from her for three years."
So play YMCA.
"If you have not gathered all of your documents or made any estimated payments, you could soon be targeted by the IRS."
I really just don't be reacting to him.
"And then lastly, what role do you and Governor Shapiro expect to play over the next three months until the election?"
Trump held a massive 36-point advantage over Biden in rural areas.
"That's a pretty compelling stat, especially when you look at how our economy are unemployment into the historic low right now in America."
"So that's what the buzz is that the way big states, swing states like Pennsylvania, go America will go that way."
The polls have been all over the place.
"You know, there's some type of political gridlock."
There's a lot.
"Well, look, she is holding an event in Bucks County, Pennsylvania."
They overstated his support by three points back then.
They will be focused on yours.
That is an issue.
"You know, we're still."
"issue made up by I don't know the D.C. consulting class, the deep state, the propaganda press."
"In fact, we're going to go straight to the big board to start the hour off, talk about why, why the battleground state might very well be the key and decide the election winner."
"All right, CBS News chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa joins me now."
That's pretty much the election.
"I've been telling you guys, they don't want him jailed."
It's always going to be mad.
"Chip, I want to tap into your Democratic strategist background here with Harris seeming to face a bit of a dilemma."
"It's not that they were in deficit mode, I just want more."
You do it exceptionally well.
But Pennsylvania Kamala Harris.
The results were astounding and we began to get answers to some unanswered health issues.
"For Harris, the event was a chance to tap into Biden's enduring popularity and connect with the grassroots."
He had blood all over his face.
I mean we haven't gone anywhere.
"What's really interesting, it's almost like someone realized banning fracking isn't the best idea when you need those Pennsylvania votes."
"Also, Tom Tillis, somewhat more moderate Trump supporter from North Carolina, wrote, Laura Loomer is a crazy conspiracy theorist who regularly utters disgusting garbage."
She didn't do anything.
Is this just a fluke?
"You've made Wilkes-Barre, you've made Luzerne County very proud, Kelly Meyer."
"For me, character is a major issue."
Georgia was like 20 K votes.
"All right, Nancy, thank you for that."
"As of right now, I'm going to go through the details that we have of the event of President Donald Trump being shot."
43% let's see.
Is he our pet?
"I mean, this is, I'm going to have to go in and make an updated map at this point because of this, you know, it's going to take a few more polls to be able to say definitively what the trend is here."
"So we both had great credit, but we both had mortgages and we both had debt, right?"
All t about it.
How long is Trump's endorsement good for?
What do you have on that?
"But the question, are these candidates truly on board with the MAGA agenda or just looking to get Trump's seal of approval and the spoils that come with it?"
"Blammo, right?"
"So what this whole game is, is about building up a huge firewall for the Democratic Party."
She's ready to be commander in chief and she released her medical records.
Thank you very much And now we're gonna pivot over to CBS News campaign reporter Olivia Rinaldi.
She views her role as a high profile surrogate and people often forget she's not a politician.
I need you to make peace with it now.
"I think that's a successful way to go after your opponent, is to talk about their record."
"One, do those numbers match your internal numbers, Senator?"
He's a coach.
But it's not just Harris who needs Pennsylvania.
They had Hillary Clinton winning it by six points.
"Just your raw vote total went down 300,000 votes while Republicans went down only 50,000 votes."
"He was down earlier in the night, but he ended up coming in first."
So security very tight here and also involving lots of different kinds of federal law enforcement as well as local law enforcement as well.
And it's unfortunate.
I wish that we would break the mold of what we've had.
"You know, it is true that maybe all the polls this time don't underestimate Trump."
"Even for her, though, it seems odd that more than half of her actual policy positions are literally borrowed from her opponent."
And we are indeed going to make America great again.
Chris Cox is getting it done in between the liberal cities.
"I appreciate all the, all the memes."
"He's good on public education, which is an issue that's important to me."
"Many wait to see if he'll announce his VP pick before the Republican National Convention, set to kick off in just two days out in Milwaukee."
I have hobbies.
"He couldn't possibly have a decent proposal for healthcare, and he knows it, right?"
"And that actually ties into another major concern the article raises, which is outreach to voters of color."
"And last time Trump had a rally in Atlanta, I will say he told this huge crowd of supporters that Trump, that Kemp, excuse me, is disloyal."
"All right, so then everybody's home ownership prices go up, $25,000."
And so it will be very enticing to watch just how much this election is defined by what happens at this moment in time.
"This razor-thin margin demonstrates that Pennsylvania is highly competitive, and Trump remains a formidable challenger capable of gaining ground."
 We begin with the race for the White House where former President Barack Obama hit the campaign trail for Kamala Harris in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania on Thursday.
"As Barack Obama continued to open a bigger can of worms after addressing the crowds from the podium, he spoke to a group of black men separately."
"But I find that so unlikely just for the simple fact it hasn't happened in Pennsylvania in 2020 or 2016, when Trump's on the ballot every year."
And that's what we're seeing from that.
That doesn't happen.
"Libby, we haven't gotten in touch with those two actors or the two people who were featured in that ad, so we're still trying to find these people."
"And in terms of who it's going to be, he also says that there are a lot of options on the table and he hasn't necessarily made up his mind yet."
I'm doing it for the people that are close to me.
We're talking.
And that's why we're one of the battleground states and probably one of the most important states of this election year.
"Voting rights and democracy, women's rights, workers rights, you could add to that list, obviously."
But I want you to lay that out for people in particular to understand that in Pennsylvania.
"Yeah, that's been an issue that voters have identified throughout the campaign, whether it was Joe Biden or Kamala Harris leading the Democratic ticket is something that they're very aware of and very concerned about."

"If someone says, look, I like Governor Josh Shapiro."
No country even came close.
I know a lot of people are pissed off at Republicans for not trying to pass that act earlier.
"Well, Kaitlyn, we've got two big debates."
And then he'll just go from there.
It's just that his numbers are usually fake in the wrong direction for you.
That's what I'm saying.
"Everyone else, Trump plus one, Trump plus two."
"I tell you, so if it, if it gets the point where we do see a huge shift in the demographic and don't get me wrong, people keep talking about black men, but black women, black women are, are, are, you know, they, they, they're the biggest demographic for the democratic party, but they don't vote in the same percentage either."
He's leading in them.
There's no question.
"What he's trying to do, specifically in this case, unclear, but we know he's been trying to sow doubts and suggest that he's not getting proper attention or credit for the size and popularity of his campaign."
Please have a seat.
"Look, I think they're right."
Thompson's contribution is a testament to his confidence in Harris' ability to lead the nation to economic prosperity.
As Cuban Americans make up a significant portion of the Hispanic electorate.
Certainly that's what the Biden campaign hopes will do or at least drive voters to do exactly what you just described.
People understand it's bullsh- It's bullsh- Wind is bullsh- I think it's all bullsh- I got indicted more than him on bullsh- Dude.
"Been a great governor, working with Democrats and Republicans to get stuff done."
"Thank you, and thank you for your work."
"One of the most important is the economy, particularly the state's manufacturing sector."
"At that point, I think it's going to be a lot different this cycle."
"If your coworkers acted like that, they wouldn't be your coworkers for very long."
"Inflation, too, is a key concern, with 78% of voters highlighting it as a major factor in their decision."
I was born with President Obama wrapping up.
"It's OK, as long as our side wins."
This is a bulldog.
His administration failed to remove ineligible voters and clean the voter rolls.
"In order for people to feel, in order for Democrats to feel comfortable about Bob Casey Jr. beating McCormick in the Pennsylvania Senate race, Democrats need to have banked around 335,000 votes."
Scott can you tell us a bit of what you're seeing now?
What is that betrayal?
And I believe it too.
"It's obviously if he loses, he's Scrittin' Joe."
"Allegheny County, which is in western Pennsylvania, that's where Pittsburgh is, accounts for 10%, or at least accounted for 10% of the 2020 turnout in all of Pennsylvania."
Because it's a blue state.
"Indeed, Republicans had a real opportunity to select that strong challenger, specifically the relatively moderate hedge fund manager and former Treasury Department official David McCormick, who finished second in the Republican primary by just 951 votes."
Yuki.
It was a chaotic moment.
The U.N. estimates place that it would take over a decade just to eliminate the rubble and it would take multiple decades to rebuild.
Harris leads the poll by three points.
"Yeah, all right, Matt O'Donnell, always a pleasure to talk with you."
Damn.
"And be sure to tune in to the ABC News Presidential Debate, the first between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, September 10th, right here on ABC News Live."
This is an apples to apples comparison.
"But to me, and I know that you talk about the bad economy, you talk about all of the costs and the costs are so bad."
Is that article biased?
"The things that are going to happen are going to happen anyway either president, it doesn't matter but that does not mean that I want Trump to get in."
There's a lot there that she can answer to.
And what you're looking at is the Shapiro and the blue wall numbers.
"He also says execution after birth it's execution no longer abortion because the baby is born is Okay, and that's not okay with me."
And Jeff had just finished his speech and he was coming in there to decompress for a second before he went back out.
"We know there's a lot of Catholics in Eastern Pennsylvania, a lot of Polish American voters."
And that's where I'm at.
I'm also selfishly excited that I get to keep Governor Josh Shapiro here in Pennsylvania as my governing partner.
That's no real surprise.
Trying to make that case to black men around the country that especially younger black men that she should be the one with their vote.
And a lot of this is because the fact that the American public now views Kamala Harris in a very different way than they did before she was the nominee for president.
And Mark and Matthew.
Or abortion.
"She has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists, Shapiro, Arizona U.S."
I looked at a dozen polls this month.
He wants a political issue to run against me.
"At the debate, Harris tried to claim credit for the Biden administration's increase of fracking leases."
"Harris' policies on expanding healthcare access and funding medical research resonate with John's vision for the future of healthcare, motivating her substantial donation."
Let's go to the image.
I can't handle this.
But voters also seem to have felt that longevity of the time.
"That means that there are 300,000 hunters in Pennsylvania that are not registered."
"That is, if I have the geography correct in Bucks County, which that's where you grow up, Robert."
Or is he just a reminder that she's part of the current administration?
"I think that's why it's, what does Trump use?"
"My video this morning I said, I believe Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will win this state by one to two points, but right now, a four point margin isn't far out from where it's closer to be."
Brave.
"Yeah, Wisconsin is another really interesting state."
And shortly thereafter you had China talking about invading Taiwan.
We just haven't seen that yet.
"The air we're breathing with the geoengineering and the chemtrails, if you want to call it the conspiracy theory version."
Those are areas where she could really draw separation with herself and Joe Biden.
People like Kamala Harris trying to ride a crowd up doing all this jazz right here.
All three of those names have been in the conversation really since the start.
That's it.
Is there going to be cheating going on?
"What if Jill Stein was the spoiler that gave this election to Donald Trump because of I mean, 2% in Michigan, that's pretty good."
"That means affordable housing, a living wage and reproductive freedom."
And yet our government treated as though our current government is treating it as though we don't need this energy.
And who can really say what's going to happen?
"Well, thanks for having me."
Hold that in your head.
But now the Biden-Harris administration's record appears to be dragging her down.
So the campaign is certainly trying to find ways for her to continue to message on this.
"There was one television that was working, and I happened to be passing it when I heard that speech."
"But I know at least on the Democratic side, we've been making sure that we're messaging in the appropriate way to connect with Latino voters, focusing on issues that are important to Americans because all of these voters are fundamentally and before anything else Americans, but making sure that we're doing it in a way that's culturally sensitive and sometimes in Spanish."
And how confident are you?
"The election would be entirely different if MSNBC reported just like CNN, which is an incredibly low bar because CNN is very fake news, as we all know."
Maybe Republicans are just more reliant on early voting.
Do we see Donald Trump investing time and campaign money in Pennsylvania in a way that shows his campaign kind of gets how important Pennsylvania is?
Four years coming from Connecticut supported a 55 year old or a Medicare buy in or dropping it to 55.
Pennsylvania has more than 20 percent of the natural oil and gas that is extracted through fracking.
We saw him reach up and touch his head.
"Well, you scroll down here and look at that."
"Do you think that Kamala Harris is going to do as well with these white working class voters, you know, compared to somebody like Joe Biden?"
Me too.
Trump has backed Perdue and then Mike Pence has actually elevated his involvement on the Kemp side which is really interesting.
Expect this to be a debate about real issues.
 I want to bring in our team of political experts for some analysis right now.
"Their message of unity, progress, and opportunity resonated with Pennsylvanians looking for leadership that reflects their values and aspirations."
"Well, he's first of all, Bob Casey is a great American supporting Kamala Harris."
"For Donald Trump and his cronies, freedom means that the powerful can do whatever they please."
Just last week a local dairy in operation for over 65 years announced the closure of their bottling operations due to rising costs of supplies and down demand.
This is according to a CBS News poll.
"She's set to speak in Charlotte around 3.40, then Greensboro at 6.50."
And we have spent the last day and a half talking to voters on the ground here in Bucks County across the political aisle.
I'm sure they'll probably go higher.
I'm talking to other YouTubers to find out if we can stream it.
But don't quote me on it.
We know about what's happening to our girls.
She's going to New Hampshire on Wednesday.
Mark Zuckerberg is admitting that the FBI and the CIA told the big tech like Facebook and Twitter that there was going to be Russian disinformation specifically.
We also have a key governor's race there.
"RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, take it or leave it?"
Yet they found Harris up by four in Pennsylvania.
"You know, the Biden campaign has been very clear that they want these Haley supporters."
"And that's with Dems being plus three, according to Gallup, 2016 Dems were plus six Trump nearly one."
Look at this beautiful dog.
"So Casey's been kind of flat, as you can see in the graph in front of you, but McCormick has been gaining, which of course is cause for concern for Democrats."
"Speculation continues about Kennedy's potential role in a second Trump administration, though he has avoided discussing specific positions."
We know this for a fact.
Do you think that somebody planned it?
So as I mentioned we're taping this on Monday night September 30th.
"What can you tell us from a ground up view of how things are looking there, not only just for the presidential contest, which is obviously top of mind, but got a very important Senate race going on between Dave McCormick and Bob was Bob Casey, right?"
 Pennsylvania voters react to the Trump and Harris debate.
"He wants you to believe that if you let him round up whoever he wants and ship him out, all your problems will be solved."
This is a much different race than what President Trump faced when he was here in July.
But will these hot button issues be enough to drive tens of millions of young voters to the polls?
"See 58-3, 56-7."
"Now, I should be clear that this is from July."
Harris will return to the Keystone state tomorrow for a campaign event in Philadelphia.
"Yeah, I'm I'm not too sure."
"Hell yeah, gas down to 290 a gallon."
Trump almost did better than 2016.
We know that Shapiro is a big advocate for protecting abortion rights over in the Senate.
I could also tell you it's worth noting the crowd.
This battle is as close as it gets.
But Harris has not performed.
He has a lead in Arizona.
You saw what happened in Atlanta with Fani?
That's less than 2022.
Let's take a look at the next clip.
"And so things like that that maybe are difficult to track with economic data that people do see on a day-to-day basis, especially, again, in an area where we're used to being known as a low cost of living area, and it doesn't feel like that anymore."
Let's let's do this.
"It's a vital swing state, guys."
"If the same polling misoccurs that occurred back in 2020, Trump's got it."
"And it shows why getting people engaged, especially those who haven't felt heard or represented is so important."
"Now, when you watch this, you'll see the interaction here and the guy who he takes the hat from ends up calling him like, I'm proud of you, you'll fart and all this other kind of stuff."
Again the Democrats are normally the organized ones.
"That's the only, by the way, that is the only reason that is the only reason they can argue."
We're ready for a better story.
We're probably at peak possibility for surprises right now.
"We are likely to see, it may not be as dramatic in fact, I don't think it will be as dramatic in effect as last time, but it will still be something to watch more on election day that is likely those Republican in-person small county votes are likely to come in more quickly than, you know, the big urban areas or even the big suburban areas where Democrats are stronger."
And these aren't just ancestral Democrats from Western PA becoming Democrats or Republicans now.
So that's in Pennsylvania.
"So when we do open it, there is another envelope."
And I think that's what Josh Shapiro and I have been doing.
You think I'm kidding?
Any kind of energy you see is false.
Anything worth having is worth fighting for.
Could we see more of these people who are charged in this case potentially come forward now that Ellis has cooperators operate under the same physics rules as dominoes?
16 million are now reportedly eligible to vote in their first presidential election.
"However, recent events have forced the Democrats to lose out on some of their voter base."
"Some people have been waiting here for two days for this, so, you know, it's a little bit tough."
Do you believe her?
"And yet, when Donald Trump lies or cheats or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls POWs losers or fellow citizens vermin, people make excuses for it."
And now Kathy Barnett is surging to the point where this race is neck and neck because she had a good debate performance and because people are totally dissatisfied with the other two choices.
None of these other guys out here got these.
Lisa Slotkin is winning.
What more can you tell us about those things?
I'm sound like how.
"But on Poly Market, the night before Walls was chosen, there was a random surge in favor of Shapiro at the end, just randomly surging, right?"
Do we have any entrepreneurs in the house?
But one thing I did hear and they kept repeating that they said that they felt deserted.
She's very visible across the country.
I?
"Lastly, we turn our attention to Nevada, where the polling data presents a different narrative."
"I mean, it's run by a person who's a retard."
What are they focusing on for November?
"But anyways, folks, thank you so much for watching."
I think there's a lot of talk on the right about the left being very woke and you know I think it's definitely true for some people but a lot of us are just kind of trying to prioritize human rights and trying to make sure that we have respect for others and I think that a lot of what you see that seems very extreme on the left is not representative of all of us.
"Allentown, some of your viewers might remember the Billy Joel song from the 80s, that's not Allentown anymore."
We care about centering worker and union's rights and also wanting to understand what's unfolding in Yemen.
And so they did start a sort of an inquiry into it.
Immigration has scared me.
"I think about the job that I was elected to do right now, which is the highest honor of my life, serving as governor of Pennsylvania and wanting to do the best damn job every single day that I can put points on the board for the good people of Pennsylvania."
"Tim Ryan, the former Ohio congressman said he took a lot of hits from his fellow Democrats in late June when he became the first Democrat to recommend Vice President Kamala Harris to replace Biden atop the Democratic ticket after Biden's disastrous debate performance."
"I just been here to talk Pennsylvania politics with you all day, but man, you got a lot of critical races."
I have no interest in that.
I feel good about it.
So where is Trump's base?
Is this about on par with what we've seen in other elections or is there a shift that's happening here?
It is still a source point.
"Specifically, the court rejected a challenge brought by Democratic officials aimed at eliminating the mandate that mail-in ballots must be dated and submitted by certain deadlines."
"Oh, it's a runaway Trump train."
Let's end on that.
Trump could have said this up himself so people will rally behind him so he could win the presidency or somebody fucking missed.
And it's even tighter race when it comes to the presidential.
"I mean, without Pennsylvania, I don't see how Kamala has a path at all."
Now Donald Trump stands at the lowest point he has been in this entire past three months.
"And again, we're talking about people in the middle who don't know quite which way they're going."
"Analyzing these results, we can clearly see that the results are shifting towards blue."
I just don't see why...
"She basically said that they were all talk, no action."
"And if rounding up and deporting millions of desperate people, many of them women and children, is the answer to everything?"
The Trump campaign is going to try and get those rural voters that he has such tremendous success without.
And you said it well.
"It was that last comment there from that Trump voter that has rung out a few times from other Trump voters here, even though they've said they're going to vote for Trump."
Dig deeper.
A lot of people really aren't saying Trump's going to be like winning any of those states by like three or four points to really skew the average.
I love to see it.
Freeze the screen if you like.
"Here in 2024 though, Trump had polled within striking distance, or even ahead of Biden in Virginia at times this cycle."
And they're targeting Republican voting districts.
"They've seen in recent elections, some very good luck with people like John Federman and Josh Shapiro winning in 2022, and then other circumstances where sometimes it's not as lucky."
They've got the cash.
What do you think that Americans in the middle thought about what they heard tonight?
It's the economy and its immigration.
"A lot of folks who came here looking for more opportunity and when you have folks who are focused on opportunity, focused on getting ahead, focused on making sure that children do well, they tend to listen very closely to what presidential candidates have to say."
"Now, the papers do, and you just write on a sheet of paper, concept of a plan."
Why does Erie matter so much?
"Oh, that's such a good question."
"Somebody who was raised in the middle class, believes in the values that built this country, worked her way through college in McDonald's, served with distinction in every office she has ever held, who is as prepared for the job as any nominee for President has ever been."
She sucks.
"So it was a bit of a slow news day due to the Labor Day holiday, and I went through about a dozen new sites this morning looking for a few stories to put on your radar as you get back to work, and I came across just a couple."
But if it was just because of covid you would see roughly the same percentage not Republicans are down 15% but Democrats are down 25%.
Like they're finally taking this seriously.
"They were like, I don't know about that because skateboards don't sell that much."
"No, I mean, no, it doesn't bother me."
"Somebody who should not be in this position, regardless of what color she is of what gender she is."
That entire place was caught off guard.
"Today, she is down just five."
He's their leader.
Glad you asked.
"Because probably she has their best interest that she, when she becomes the president, will push through it."
"Labor leadership may be, but that event had people that were invite only from, you know, the labor unions, most of them, there are a lot of them who are labor leaders, there were some rank and file there."
You sent some fighters to D.C.
"Can you tell me about that, what the campaign is saying this morning about what the former president was signaling?"
" The race is a dead heat in the state of Pennsylvania according to pretty much all of the polling including the latest from CBS You gov so much attention is being paid to the state because it was because of its 19 Electoral votes and how crucial they are in fact no Democrats since 1948 has won the White House without winning, Pennsylvania Joining us now Democratic senator from Pennsylvania John Fetterman senator."
It's going to be clean.
When a part just like shits the bed and it can't do it anymore.
"Biden's ratings are very, very low."
I think we saw some of that in the sound bite.
"Running against Kamala Harris, not Joe Biden, and he doesn't seem to understand that."
"Yeah, look, I think it is a somewhat less salient point but still nevertheless quite salient."
"You saw folks excited, energized."
"While acknowledging the heightened public interest toward AKA this year, Valerie McDonald Roberts, the connection and social action committee chairwoman at the Pittsburgh graduate chapter, affirmed the sorority's mission has largely stayed the same."
 Thanks for being back with us tonight.
"Talking about Melania, what?"
"Jay, let's start with you."
Pittsburgh synagogue?
Does it matter that he was never trump in the past?
We delete it.
Her campaign just issued a statement.
That's a friend of mine.
So you can imagine he was a little nervous right.
"Hey, everyone."
She beat Donald Trump in the debate and she's had some good polling numbers off that.
Whether that sector is enough to outweigh the deep blue pit of Pennsylvania remains to be seen.
But it comes as Trump is facing controversy over connections to conspiracy theories.
Again I want to thank Madam City Clerk Kimberly for that introduction and for the ongoing conversation that we've been having and her story is sadly the story of so many people and it is the story that the president and I have been hearing in many places around our country and I know it is long overdue and it is time that we actually implement solutions and I'm here to say we are and I thank all of the leaders here for being a part of that and I want to thank all of the leaders who are here including administrator Michael Regan.
So let's see where they're at.
It's tempering itself a little bit.
What's that like?
Sean Parnell on the Clay and Buck Network.
"And here in Pennsylvania specifically, and we're looking at 300,000 registered Jewish voters."
Donald Trump.
"And you see it at the grocery prices, really everything that you picked up, you say, OK, this is a little bit different than what you're used to there."
You're just going to be spinning your wheels.
"Guys, I heard that former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick is planning to write a book."
"Well, sir, do you want to play your song and then greet a few people or do you want to?"
He'll secure our borders.
He leads by five points over Joe Biden and that's with RFK Jr claiming he has enough signatures to get on the ballot in Michigan.
I've been hearing a lot from Kamala Harris lately.
"So so if he's up by two to three points in Pennsylvania, he is easily winning."
Our Scott McFarland is there.
So we'll see what happens here.
"Trump, meanwhile, may need to pivot his strategy to address the specific concerns of Nevada voters, including those related to the tourism and hospitality industries, which are vital to the state's economy."
"Well, James and I are both Pennsylvania junkies."
Teamsters union in Michigan.
"Wants you to buy the word of God, Donald Trump edition."
Let's look at this endorsement draft that Trump drafted up here talking about.
I think Trump will outperform 46 in Pennsylvania.
"The official said nearly 2,000 North Carolinians signed up to volunteer during Tuesday night's debate."
They liked his response to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.
"So I think if Republicans can get the race back to talking about the issues, then the issues are on their side."
"Set between the events of the first and second Aliens, the seventh installment in the Alien franchise takes us back to space where no one can hear you scream."
They tried to fortify the elections.
It's a heck of a lot more likely that Republicans also win Wisconsin and Michigan as well.
You think Donald Trump's ever changed his diaper?
It's a reminder that every vote counts and every voice matters.
And I wasn't perfect right off the bat.
"One of the negatives on this poll is that they interview three quarters are white, all right, and generally speaking, the whites are gonna vote for Trump."
But there's a little bit of a problem.
"And she certainly and the Biden administration, to be fair, has kept the Trump tariffs in place and even doubled down on some of them."
You can't win on those things.
"You'd be, you'd call up your cousins and you'd say, have you noticed?"
"Ugh, that's not good for them because they need to win Pennsylvania."
"I'm pretty sure they're going to put out a mental health campaign behind them, but if he was any other color, I guarantee it would have been something else."
But she's run a fairly flawless campaign so far and still isn't budging.
And so the last election Biden won it very narrowly.
We just said a side Kamala Harris point five said victory.
He didn't demonize his political opponents.
We're in this together.
"You know, now that fracking has worked as well as it has, there was a point in time, at least when Trump was president, that we were energy independent."
They've got to do something because black men are not in love with Kamala even though Obama came out and said she's basically your Kamala.
They're not just purchasing the cookies.
They now found Trump tied in Pennsylvania.
So that's why we've been asking over at the White House and with the campaign on just when we might see President Biden do that.
And I'll see you guys in the next one.
"And President Trump is winning Pennsylvania right now in many of the battleground states because again, people in many of the battleground polls, rather, because people there realize their lives were better off under his leadership."
"Speaking to Sean Parnell, combat veteran host of the Battleground Live podcast on the Clay and Buck Network."
And then he calls the New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman.
"No, there's a good chance that these are just new voters that have registered to vote and they are becoming Republicans."
"Thank you, gentlemen."
It's real bad.
Bar earrings are all the rage.
The trend over the two months showed us to have Biden at the time was struggling to rally the suburban voters in his favor.
We're going to have you on a lot.
"The insights provided about Pennsylvania elucidate several key takeaways that encapsulate its significance, potential impacts, and the myriad consequences that Harris may encounter in her bid for the presidency."
"1988, which would be 1988, 1992."
"Christine Gotta, who supported Nikki Haley during the primary, still undecided."
They passed a free school meals program.
Two years on.
"And I think whatever people's opinion on the question of democracy, you can tell a liar when you see them try to dodge a question."
I'm really proud of that work we're doing in Pennsylvania.
"And if you look at history, that's not entirely true."
"He's going to be heading to Arizona and Nevada later this weekend, this weekend."
"Adams, who has long been an advocate for digital privacy and cybersecurity, supports Harris' policies on data protection and online security."
"You take somebody who's familiar to the region, you replace them with a liberal nut job from California who's been on record flip-flopping on something like fracking and, you know, co-sponsored the initial Green New Deal."
"They were in Reading, Pennsylvania."
She's got the lowest ever polling for things like that.
"She rallied voters in Erie, telling the crowd the region is one of the most influential in presidential elections with the vote in Erie County, often predicting the national result."
"But as Reuben mentioned, you need to make a plan."
"But yeah, man, we better get into our political bag."
"Yeah, I mean, it is striking."
Why is your race tight?
So there's Harris on the one hand.
Trump is relatable because what do we say?
Yes she's not a perfect like down the middle mainline Democrat.
"And not only are people believing this, meteorologists are getting death threats and angry phone calls and emails from viewers who think they're covering it up."
They've weaponized.
"Going back to this 2016, because we're 2020 back."
"And I want to see more people do stuff like this, more politicals do stuff like this."
"A lot of the people that are registering to vote to vote against Donald Trump, they're not typically going to be registered as Republicans."
Is there a state you view as the most important?
I'm not sure that there is.
"However, if Trump is able to broaden his appeal and maintain strong support in these regions, it could pose a formidable challenge to Harris's campaign."
"We have a long way to go before the election, but still at the same time, we're knocking on the door."
"Yes, we're going to do live streams after all the debates."
And I know you were talking to a pollster there or talking about the poll.
"We don't have any places like this where we are from and recently the thing I've heard the most is I used to purchase bulk beef from a farmer nearby, friend, relative, but they don't have cattle anymore."
"They understand that too many folks, not just here in Arizona, but across the country, are still struggling to pay the bills."
Trump's people right here.
And I think that is also why I am proud and I do have the support of the Steel Workers Union.
"That means they're using a 2020 election exit polls, essentially, to say this is what we're going to use for our polling sample here."
"Can you believe that in the United States of America, that is still not necessarily guaranteed to all people to access clean water?"
It would kill him.
"They're essentially betraying who they are if they vote for Democrats, saying if you had Democrats to support you were Jewish, you have to have your head examined."
"Well, get this."
"The problem, I think, is that that is being massively overshadowed right now by inflation in particular."
It's the greatest movement in the history of our country.
"Yeah, their sample was like a Biden plus seven sample."
 All of you all welcome back to yet another political episode.
We can talk about that later.
I think that creating that sense of a community amongst voters to get them engaged and get them out to the polls is going to be super important.
Oh my goodness gracious.
It's a lot of merchandise and merchandise.
"And if he wins reelection, that gives him a boost on the national stage."
They're not a representation of trans people.
"And that is why I'm talking with folks about the work that I have done in my career, whether it be in particular as Vice President, what I've done to put more billions of dollars, actually, into community banks to increase access to capital for small business owners."
Watch.
"Scale a very optimistic, a very pessimistic."
"Share the videos, share the shows."
I'm just going to play this and now I'll react to it.
It's one of the reasons I'm here to support him and let everyone know we won't be intimidated.
But what has happened this time around is because it is a very polarized election season.
"In fact, Casey's lead over McCormick has been shrinking in recent weeks."
Fun fact.
Absolutely.
So he has essentially decided to ignore the advice of his campaign staff and go on this massive bender at both his Pennsylvania rally and also online.
You just say Hannibal Lecter.
You have to look elsewhere to be able to work.
"They have early vote this time and so there is definitely an effort to register voters here, get them to vote and support President Trump."
"For example, here was an off script moment earlier in the day where a UPS employee told Joe Biden quote, the only reason I have a pension is because of you."
"Let's move the, see these votes, you've got about a million votes in there."
"If we get another four years of this tyrannical government of this left of this Marxism, this communism that they're pushing, if Camilla Harris gets in the most leftist senator ever, it's a wrap."
"But again, a lot of doom."
"In 2016, many suburban voters, particularly in areas like Macomb County, shifted towards Trump."

"Well, sir, do you want to play your song and then greet a few people?"
"Missed it entirely in Philadelphia, Detroit, and other key cities where black turnout in general was lower than it had been for President Obama and black men specifically."

The problems just keep adding up for Harris.
 What Josh Shapiro brings to Pennsylvania is that he loves what he's doing and he has a passion and it's a ministry.
Jerry Flynn.
The finish line is in sight.
He had just had that stroke.
"At the end of the day, I think you heard in Bob Casey a sense that he believes he's closer to the heart of Pennsylvania and tried to staple Dave McCormick to Donald Trump, who is also popular, but he lost the state the last time around."
"And in some ways, this is a race about who do you like less incumbent politicians or hedge fund managers, right?"
"They look at this and they say, Trump is done."

I'm your host Tim Lambert.
"It is me, Real American, back again with a new video."
"It's, it's really tight, but you can make an argument either Pennsylvania or Wisconsin could be, you know, in terms of which one's easier for Trump to win."
And Pennsylvania is among those handful that has the most electoral college votes among the states that ultimately decide this election.
But Watkins says at this point he would be really surprised if Shapiro wasn't the pick and a lot of that has to do with what he called the governor's electoral strength.
So it's a very critical region and for both political parties.
And what was that camera?
The Senate majority is up for grabs.

Some of them are remaining true.
"All right, so Kelly, we are seeing former presidents Clinton and Obama both hit the campaign trail for Harris."

Okay so because there are so like 43% of all the votes cast in this entire state are coming from this section and this section that means there are a lot of voters in those areas which means it takes much longer to actually count those votes so it's always late into the evening Allegheny will come in first in Pennsylvania and all of the sudden the numbers in the blue column start shooting up and then when the numbers over in this area come in the numbers will continue to go up.
"A massive, massive change."
She's ahead in Arizona and North Carolina and narrowing his lead in Nevada and Georgia.

His numbers maintain exactly where they will likely be.
 The sycophantic fanbase that is known for playing the victim when it comes to everything just watch their guy almost get kablooied and then come back up with a black power fist.
"And then the editing, of course, for both sides, I think nobody was really happy."
That's exactly what Josh Shapiro and I did in our campaign for governor and lieutenant governor.
You heard his words coming from him.
"But listen, you know, these races are closed, James, you know that."
That'd be so dope.

"Now, when the, when you look at it and you look at what's happening all over the country now, states are voting."
Will it be a 40 point shift?
There's also a lot of nerves about Pennsylvania.
"Senator, we were always appropriately suspicious of polling around here, given the pattern of polling that we have seen in the past."
"We still see a few polls where Casey is out five, six points, maybe more."

If we look at those clips that I just showed you and say that person should be nowhere near the nuclear codes should be nowhere near a position of power that Donald Trump is someone who should be absolutely disqualified for being anywhere near any position of power because of his own behavior.
It's a drawing.
And he's also spending time there because he loves Pennsylvania.
"Again, that doesn't mean Trump's going to for sure lose if he loses the state."
"Democrats taking more advantage of that option than Republicans of the former president did encourage his supporters over the weekend to vote early, vote by mail."
"Yeah, I think we're starting to see more ways people have adjusted to."
We'll give him a break on this.
Those are not my words.
I don't think about it that way.
It could be a worrying sign for the Democrats because they need mail-in voting to run up the score as in-person.
"Hey, how come in?"
Nice and full.
They're showing...
"You could also see in the two way race, practically every recent poll shows Kamala Harris leading."
You could find me mostly on Instagram at tatju77.

The Democratic establishment is cheering the choice of Walz as well.
How would you talk about and how she used that strategy effectively?
I've all but said that across the board.
"She said the same speech, that she had nothing, that had nothing to do with the question."
It's more than the eighty thousand votes that Biden won in 2020.
And that turned out not to be true what he was saying.
"And that's commendable for Tim Walz because it shows that he has a story that won him an election in Minnesota that can win him an election this November with Kamala Harris, and it goes right through Pennsylvania."
"Five point five average error, five point five partisan bias in favor of the Republicans."
"And of course, this follows the day before where Donald Trump said that January 6th was an insurrection caused by Nancy Pelosi."
"Tim Walz is adding, and he was sort of the do no harm candidate, as many people described."
"And although I would agree that a lot of these questions have been asked, the key to any good interview is that follow up is, OK, you just dodged."
But here's what's happened.
"He said, well, we've got to look at everything."
"I'd probably vote for her in the primary at this point, but it is what it is."
"She's upping her outreach to black men in particular, a key constituency for Harris."
"Many of them told me, well, they have issues on, you know, they're not happy with who they've traditionally voted for or their families have traditionally voted for on a myriad of issues."
And that is a good thing.
"So I think Trump has a really high floor, but a very low ceiling."
"As soon as Kamala set her sights on the White House, things got, shall we say, flexible."
And so that's obviously kind of signals where the party is moving.
"Hearing aids, more than 50 prescription drugs."
"Oh, my goodness."
She doesn't want the world to know.
Trump had about 62% to Secretary Clinton 33.

"And with Donald Trump's proposal today, look, I know a lot of guys in the energy sector that work in either oil or gas, and they work in 80 hour weeks, sometimes even more."
"And so being down again, 5.6 percent also means that the unfavorability rating has now dropped below 50 percent, meaning the majority of the nation no longer views Kamala Harris as unfavorable."
You'll see both candidates in split screen and you'll see what those comparisons are.
"The version that existed for decades, it's running, it's going to run out by 20."
"Dude, this guy does not stop fighting for the American people."
Donald Trump was never accused of inciting insurrection.

You want to be a rebel?
"It's almost like 6040 for Trump, which is pretty insane."
So there has to be some Biden in this campaign.
"Republicans only went down roughly 50,000 votes and you look at percentages Republicans went down only like 15% Democrats went down like 25%."

"So fine, I'm glad she did it."
He's ahead comfortably there.
"I think about Robert Gates, a former Secretary of Defense."

It was the number one thing we heard.
"It seems like Biden's enthusiasm in eastern Pennsylvania is not going to be where it was in 2020 when you had fresh novelty, and his popularity has tinned since then, and he's struggling in some polls."

"He bumped into him, but there's been some things that came out Recently, you know I'll pin it below."
"He votes against funding for our roads and bridges, votes against our firefighters, even."
And she's a dear friend.
He has that ability to do it.
"Tim Walz may not massively expand on that margin, but it solidifies it in a way that would only be solidified by him or Governor Josh Shapiro, and does really good, really, really good for the Kamala Harris campaign."
Mm.
It's beyond shameless.
"Yeah, so you're telling me that the same polls that were off by six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 points back in 2016, back in 2020."

"If she just gives up in Pennsylvania, which I don't think she will, but if she's losing Pennsylvania by two to three points as of now and even Josh Shapiro wouldn't have saved them."
This is not a fact check on their beliefs.
"You remember at the time, at the end of the campaign, when a woman at one of his rallies said, Obama, you can't vote for that Arab."
He said she's an African-American woman who won office last year on a tough on crime message and would help Harris went over disillusioned black voters and working class white men.
So it's definitely hitting young families hard.
"Right now, they found Trump tied with Harris in Pennsylvania."
It's not just about having resources.
"The Trump campaign should throw everything at the state, not just invest some resources."
"However, in the 2020 US presidential election, Joe Biden won the electoral votes in Pennsylvania with 1.17% more votes than Trump."
"Pager State Freedom Fest, September 13th through 15th."

The liberal bastion.
You have no idea what he's talking about.
You made a good living too.
"Joining us are Daniel Scarpinato, Republican strategist, former Chief of Staff for Governor Doug Ducey, and Reginald Boulding, former Democratic leader in the State House of Representatives."
He's on the slander.
"But on top of that, we have good news out of Marist of all pollsters."
"Here, Donald Trump told people to go out and vote on January 5th."
In fact one woman I visited with told me that when her backyard floods she can hear sewage flowing underneath her floorboards and as a result too many communities across the south we've seen a rise in infections like hookworm which are basically people nodding tiny parasites that burrow into the skin and cause fever and nausea and abdominal pain so this is a serious issue it is a serious issue with serious health implications not to mention just basic points about what we need to do to address inequities.
And you should definitely use RCP.
"Well, again, my organization is Early Vote Action."
How many of you have voted for Donald Trump?
So follow me on those platforms as well.
"He would have to flip Georgia and Pennsylvania, both of those States."
"Folks like me, I've always adjusted my sample and applied in a little extra weight, you know, to make sure that Republicans are equitably, not equally necessarily, but equitably represented to reflect, you know, how people have voted in presidential elections."
There was a pretty large one.
"Now, that doesn't mean that."
"Yes, exactly."
Pennsylvania really is kind of the ball game.
"And so when they release polls, it also has some substance to it because they aren't here as often, but they also tend to be quite accurate in elections, especially this far out."
"On the south lawn of the White House today, President Biden condemned the attacks on the Haitians in Springfield."
I am a normal person.

But when she did you know she cribbed Trump's idea for no tax on tips.
This was a poll in Notre Dame.
Greetings to the audience.
They finally switched party affiliation.
CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett joins me now.
So they're stepping on toes all over the state.
Already so much focus had really been on this campaign on the side of President Biden.
"Appreciate you, Jay."
I think that the Union Dems that broke for Trump in 2016 are by and large going to be a break for him again.
"It's not everything, which I'm not denying."
"It's going to be a lot harder because people are ready now after what happened in 2020, we're going to have the election decided on election night."
You are doing the Lord's work.
But CBS News is not supposed to be the ones doing those hostile interviews.
"They are, you know, really, really good when it comes down to gauging political races, but sometimes they are wrong."
"We know for a fact Trump's base is in this right here, not this right here."
"So, we're currently 29 days away from the 2024 presidential election."
She's in the White House now.
"His son Alfred shared the news on social media, reminiscing about Kay's larger-than-life personality and dedication to his craft."
"And if he's running, I will."
Look at this mail-in ballot requests from 2020 to 2024 and these are from the exact same time frame roughly 50 days out from election day.
Of course they didn't have that much time with her.
She's a beautiful woman.
"But under the Joe Biden and Donald Trump matchup, on the day that Joe Biden dropped out of the race, the numbers looked far worse for the Democrats, with Donald Trump at the advantage point of 4.5% in terms of his lead over Joe Biden."
I don't say it's about myself on the back.
And that's what we've tried to do to the best of our ability over the last year.
They both won.
"And look, I mean, the guy he's running against, like just he's just like not from here."
But I'm not going to do so enthusiastically.
They're specifically targeting Rust Belt states.
"Okay, Secret Service encircled Trump within seconds of the shots being fired and the agency statement is that the former president is safe."
"Obviously, let's bring it down."
They think she is too extreme.
Donald Trump is a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he wrote down that golden escalator nine years ago.
Who comes down to golden escalator?
They're the reason dr. Oz lost the Senate race.
And I think a feeling of potentially demoralization that might affect either party.
"Hello, everybody."
"And just for the sake of argument, the middle of October poll of Quinnipiac had Biden plus eight."
"So even this, if these 10,000 were to be thrown out, these could be deciding votes, especially because if they're on net votes, like if you guys remember back in 2020, I remember, you know, trying to explain to people even after it looked like the red mirage was happening on the night of election, right?"
So who do you want representing America?
"I would like to see a leader who is able to compromise, who can work with individed government and actually lead by example and compromise."
"So anyways, guys, thanks for watching this video."
What is the Biden campaign doing to try to appeal to them?
"But the problem here, Major, is exactly what you and Anthony were talking about."
And that is her speaking about these comments from former President Trump that there is this enemy within leftist radical people he said that might need to have the National Guard or the military brought in to deal with them.
And thank you for all that you do for the people of Pittsburgh.
As we move closer to November.
"Trump, according to these polls, has somewhat of a lead in North Carolina and Georgia, places that he really wants to win."
And he was laying down on a roof that wasn't even that far from the venue.
You just can't.
You know what that means?
It depends on her audience.
"He's already put in four million dollars and we expect him to put in a hell of a lot more than that this month, next month and on October."
"In Pennsylvania, the Supreme Court's decision could have a direct effect on voter behavior and confidence by upholding the requirements for mail-in ballots."
"This is, I'm a visionary artist."
Cynthia Sabatini knows a lot about the change here.
One of the reasons why we're excelling when it comes to energy production is because of the strong relationship we have with the Biden-Harris administration.
her ineptitude and her Incompetence and her Her war on the Second Amendment.
And that tells me something that coalition is expanding that I wrote about in the Great World as opposed to drinking.
"And they know that former President Trump has done well here in 2016 and 2020, especially in the Pittsburgh area in the ex urban in rural counties around Pittsburgh."
This is not 2012 anymore.
Harris's stance back then was loud and clear.
So all my Puerto Ricans.
"Hell, Marist."
Help your friends and family members and neighbors and co-workers do the same because if enough of us make our voices heard we will leave no doubt about the election outcome.
And it's in line with Trafalgar.
"Here is one thing that she is going to do, legalize recreational marijuana for black Americans."
"But you know, I didn't do Oprah because Oprah has a lot of skeletons in her closet."
And we passed the strongest bill in the nation to make sure that only women could play in women's sports.
Is Pennsylvania really as close as the polls suggest or does one candidate have an edge that isn't reflected here?
And I think losing Pennsylvania in that way would be kind of a blow to their narrative of wanting to triumph over that assassination attempt.
"And if Biden and Biden won by four, but he was up eight four years ago, ergo, the polling was left by about four points."
"Yeah, I mean, I think Pennsylvania is absolutely a must-win state for Joe Biden in particular."
"But the point is, is that that wasn't as much third party vote in Pennsylvania as there was back in 2016."
"But by the way, first, I want to talk to you about why Harris is there."
"The man's, a little nasty sometimes, posts some mean tweets, bad character, right?"
"It's, it's, you can't do it."
So much of what he just said was a misrepresentation was a lie.
"I met the president in 1968 when my father was working for his father in Brooklyn, New York."
Donald Trump has perfectly managed to get the most votes in the polls so far and has taken a solid step towards the presidency.
"But nevertheless, I will say that last night was a decent night for Trump, but down ballot Republicans, you know a lot of crossover voting and you see the establishment propping up certain candidates that are weaker."
There you get it.
She's stunning and brave.
"She said, don't worry, everybody."
"We know that investing in our water infrastructure is one of the best decisions we can make for our country, for public health, and for environmental protection, for job creation, and for the strength and vitality of our economy."

"But while I was doing that bipartisan work in Pennsylvania, he was investing in our adversaries."
This is an outlier poll.
"In the immediate aftermath of the debate though they found Trump losing a point to hit 46 while Harris gained 1 to hit 51, a net gain of 2 for the Vice President."
That is a huge increase in the early vote for that demographic.
Democratic City Council member Jamie Arroyo says the Biden campaign needs to confront.
Trump's message appears to be resonating with suburban voters in particular.
"Another at-lassing tell poll conducted over the same date September 20 to 25 and the same sample of 1,775 likely voters also shows Trump leading Harris by three points, with Trump polling at 51% and Harris at 48%."
"She's super popular, especially in Philly."
It's on the ballot there and then of course we're going to continue on the rest of our trip.
Part of that is where people get their information.
Do you think truly this can be staged by you because I see so many comments of people saying it is going the extra lens just to be able to get to vote from people and I think the part and the reason why people are saying that it is staged the most was because of the clip that has been going viral where it was telling the person trying to get him off of the stage to calm down so he can make the black feasts into the hair a black power feasts into the hair a lot of people are stitching that part and saying come on like if this is real and not staged it wouldn't have time to be doing all of that on that stage so let me hear what you guys think about all of this I am going to see you guys in the next one.
Maybe next time we'll have a race between Nikki Haley and uncommitted.
These are new supporters for Trump for the Republican Party.
It's a new time.
"Okay, so they came, and then Newsom, all of a sudden, that whole thing petered out, and it was a bait and switch."
And I think it'd be a smart place for him to go to Erie.
Why are y for this event?
So the deduction on Wall Street was it's going to be a governor.
"Right, and it was the only battleground state that Mitt Romney won in 2012."
"And even if they would still fall short, I'd rather have Trump fall short with somebody good and have the week end up winning the primary, than have Trump endorse the week and have them win the primary by a resounding margin."
"And at that point, you cannot afford to lose a single state of your Trump outside of like Nevada."
"I mean you look at Nevada, you look at Georgia, North Carolina, all important states but from the perspective of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, you know for Harris or Trump there's no pathway to the presidency without one or multiple of these states."
"But she's had a little bit of a turnaround and also you see the fact that she's being primaried out from the left, from the establishment."
This is Marxist.
And that really does show that there is a break with union leaders and its members.
"I know a lot of us are jaded by all the crazy things that happen in the world, but I think we need to stop for a second and realize just how wild this situation is and how disastrous it could have been."
Who's the last Republican you supported?
And so he's not playing the greatest hits.
There's been reports that Harrison Walls have been paying people to show up at their events.
So we'll see how it works out for her.
Vance doesn't have the ability to appeal to the average voter.
"Kamala Harris is winning right now, and I think Donald Trump is just waking up to that, which is why you're seeing some of the attacks and his return to X and the sort of meltdown of an interview with Elon Musk."
And you could probably tell why it's Harris plus one.
"He's talking about the enemy within our country, Pennsylvania."
So folks together we will propel great cities like Pittsburgh into the future with safer healthier and more resilient water infrastructure and President Biden and Vice President Harris are investing in America and making this reality this vision a reality.
And voter turnout has increased during that time.
"Well, one of the big issues the article points to is the campaign's leadership in Pennsylvania."
Got to take care of them.
I also want to ask about his record as governor.
"I don't I don't wish this kind of crap on Biden and his family, even though I believe they are criminals that have taken advantage of the country."
CBS News correspondent Christian Benavidez following the Harris campaign Christian.
"However, Trump's victories in both 2016 and 2020 by margins of 8 and 7 points, respectively, have led many to question whether Ohio remains a battleground or if it has shifted into the Republican column."
"I mean, like we're struggling, man."
"Each poll tells a different story, but one thing is clear."
That's a state that Trump lost in 2020.
We thought we'd get 37 in Philadelphia burbs in the four counties.
He almost sounded like Trump talking.
"But in today's video, we are going to talk about that."
He loves the people of Pennsylvania.
"And now to come along and say that the government has the right to tell you or you as a woman what you can do with your body, I have a problem with that."
"We have some sick people, radical left lunatics."
It's just all there is to it.
"Well, for starters, no, this lead that she has a quotations, it's because of one poll, one poll that found Harris up by five points."
"No, but I don't know if it's because she doesn't pick him or he ultimately bows out."
"Well, where did they exactly do better was Eastern Pennsylvania and that we know."
"Chad Zieborn, a Pennsylvania based tech technical field trainer, told Fox and Friends co-host Lawrence Jones during a segment that aired on Thursday."
"But it still would give you some kind of a boost, a small one, you know, maybe a one point bump, maybe."
Let's talk about conservative groups that support our values but may not vote in elections.
You see what they do.
"So 48, 14, 18, 22, 26 minus three is 23, 1234567."
This is coming from someone that covers the Harris campaign for NBC News.
"In today's final poll, on the same which was also conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, with different with 693 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 44%, and Trump lost the poll by two points."
Can you just explain what you got going on here and who you are?
"And one of those states is, of course, your home state of Georgia, where the Georgia State Election Board approved a new rule that would require a hand count of the number of ballots cast on Election Day."
"And I think there's a new excitement on the left about this election and that does bring a little worry, always, but I think I still feel great."
The influential Cook Political Report now rates Arizona a toss up in the presidential race.
So don't come to me with that.
"The first poll was conducted between September 11 and 19th by the University of Massachusetts Lowell Center for Public Opinion, Ugov, among 800 likely voters."
"Now, look, it's going to be tough."
"All it did was make them more dangerous and less accessible, especially the people who need it."
"Yeah, stay home."
"It's tailor made and it's really working out well for, for people."
"I mean, all of that gets wrapped into these packages so that this ad."
"Students here at Arizona, you can try it with your professors."
And Jake Rosen here with me in Studio 57 with the latest on the Trump campaign.
You click on get or the cloud icon and enjoy it.
What's going on?
We're going to take a look at Pennsylvania and try to predict a Harris point five.
She'll vote Harris in November.
"Hey, don't scroll away."
And I think she has done that in her economic policies that she's laid out.
"I hate to see it happen, of course, but there are people in this country who were cheering for Custer, and there are people in this country who cheer for the Sioux."
"And Pennsylvania alongside many other battleground states has seen quite significant shifts in favor of the Democratic contender now, Kamala Harris."
I noticed a very fascinating trend.
"This issue is particularly sensitive for Pennsylvania's voters, and Harris's ability to defend her position could be a turning point in the election."
It's what?
We also he Kate Iago and other local a shout out to the late S for his efforts to stop D rid of the affordable hea
"Hi, my name is Dave Trotter."
I think Kamala Harris has demonstrated that she's that leader.
They want to win.
"As briefly as you can, say more about that."
Rita.
You can vote from October 15th to November 1st.
Even local Republicans said it was not true.
"He's flipping counties and you've got Democrats, you know, signing artillery shells to be used as an escalation force to trend to World War Three."
Ladies.
"We are trying to abandon Harris, punish Harris, Biden administration and Harris administration."
"And while I do think that's entirely fair, right?"
And I think that showed the Democratic Party that there's a pathway to victory through Gen Z.
Very squad esque member.
"He says he's going to take another question, then changes his mind and then calls Democrats evil."
Like what year is it?
"OK, so we're seeing some potential movement there."
Vance and the Republican Party in general.
It is a sentiment that we all echo.
This is what I'm talking about.
My opinion is that the justice system is being weaponized against certain individuals.
"I think that's about my quick math is that's about three and a half or four points for Kamala Harris, all the polling since the debate."
"That's a pattern that we see with these tokens in the Democratic party, the ones they promote."
He did reflect on the assassination attempt itself.
So stay tuned for that.
"It seems to be something more like this given my last prediction But let's say she even wins Arizona let's say she even wins Wisconsin still, you know Pennsylvania is still the key state just based off These two being better for Trump and they should be better for Kamala that Pennsylvania seems very key as it has the most electoral votes of any swing state So I think I've explained why it's so key probably the most important state in this election And I've noticed a concerning trend for Kamala Harris here."
What it is is these people are tired of the Democratic Party and they're bullshit.
Northampton has an industrial draw.
"Well, listen, these entry level jobs, these are people that get technical degrees as mechanics or welders."
"No, but I would say it's clear as day that Trump is a favorite."
"Okay, Trump shooter."
And that's basically what Wisconsin in and of itself tends to boil down to in the polling department.
"That 5-point gap would mark the third straight cycle in which Texas' margin narrows, though it does still go down as leaning towards Trump here."
And we're not going to let that happen.
"I did vote for Trump two times, but I've switched my allegiance."
This is just waiting in line though Look at all these people That's wild Mattel y'all this is this is definitely wild and they keep late.
"So anyways, it took about 43 minutes to do that charge."
You'll see it's without of the margin of error.
"I grew up in a middle-class household, a split family unit."
It's the economy.
And so there's a fundamental difference in this election between one candidate who's talking about issues that actually matter to the American people and another candidate who's ranting and raving like a lunatic.
Let's move them.
"Harris must present a compelling economic vision that not only appeals to urban voters, but also resonates deeply with rural constituents who may be experiencing significant economic distress."
"Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Leland Vitter, The Weeknd Show."
"One's a presidential year election, two totally different set of circumstances."
"So when you hear Trump call Kamala Harris a communist, how does that make you and your family feel?"
"Everyone, let's thank President Trump."
We'll talk again tomorrow.
"Democrats win, assuming everything else stays stagnant, which looking at the numbers over the last few cycles, it does seem like there's not going to be many shifts around the state, except for maybe this Northeast section."
So what's confirmed?
I was saying that they're not from America.
Biden reminded a packed union hall that he launched his own 2020 presidential campaign in Pittsburgh five years ago.
Harris 51 in Pennsylvania to Trump's 45.
"So theoretically, it should have caught the surge for Democrats when it comes to voter registration, if there was any."
Absolutely I'm just a middle class kid from Western Pennsylvania that loves hanging out with the people you know it's amazing and I could see that you're you're you're really mixing it up with neighbors and friends.
"They called him weird and he's like, they call me weird."
Former President Donald Trump at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks last night for a town hall.
Beautiful hat right there.
It's so good to be back with you.
But right here right now Donald Trump officially has taken the lead.
"Christian, talk to us about what the world might look like if Trump is successful."
"Who specifically, which demographic is she trying to win over there?"
We even take phone calls.
One second.
"I mean, 560 K it's, you know, it's hard to make that up."
"Even though wages are steadily growing, even though inflation is finally slowing, the price of everything, from health care to housing to groceries, it's still too high and it hurts."
"But look, I can talk about it."
"The leadership refused to endorse Kamala Harris, which is a stunning defeat for her, by the way."
"But here's a question to ponder, can Harris's newfound momentum in the suburbs of Pennsylvania and among younger voters carry her past Trump's formidable base?"
Wages have not gone up as high as some people would like.
We go watch her play.
"A few weeks ago, we had one of the deadliest hurricanes in American history."
"So he injured, he critically injured two other people."
"Of the 435 members of Congress, Tim Walz and I, I think we're the 10 least wealthy members of Congress, right, because he was in public service, his school teacher in the Army, and I was in the Army."
"She's bringing in a lot of this big money, the backing of the billionaires."
"Uh, what a what a crazy Thought that is though."
"Our White House correspondent, Laura Barone Lopez, recently spent some time there."
"Congressman Scott Perry, Republican from the state of Pennsylvania."
"It also enhances his legal and political strategy, shapes the narrative on election fraud, consolidates Republican support, and sets the stage for effective debate performance."
Meantime Harris used the joint campaign appearance to say U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned.
"In the meantime, they can't afford their groceries."
They gathered a group of Latinos to talk about those issues.
"I mean, for a long time, a lot of political reporters and myself included, analysts and such, were saying that, you know, women running away from Trump, it's really going to help Harris."
Those campaign managers aren't idiots.
"They've had some, I would say, bad reports, wildly exaggerating, engaging in moral panic over the spread of misinformation over Havana syndrome."
I'm going to be additive.
Give this a watch.
"And since then, it's only shifted further to the right, as we saw incumbents, Governor Ron DeSantis and Senator Marco Rubio, both win re-election by double digits, 19% in Ron DeSantis's case, and then 16% for Marco Rubio in the Senate race, respectively."
And I hope you still feel that way.
They were never going to win Florida.
"No, not for a second."
Trump spent the beginning of his rally talking about the assassination attempt in very somber terms.
Carmela?
Every single one of them shows a shift towards Trump.
I think I'm also somewhere in between maybe leaning a little bit optimistic.
I didn't.
"So even if Trump is down by three or four in a state like Michigan, he could very easily wouldn't buy two or three."
"And she's wholly ignored them, but not just ignored them now."
So the turnout is too low to really extrapolate.
Excuse me.
"And JP and I talked about, and she raised the fact that Trump has literally said that if he is not elected, US democracy itself will end."
"Pennsylvania for her is considered a big important state, because there are other states that may be out of reach in that battleground state alignment."
No cameras in the room.
Also rejected the idea saying it's not sensical and it would have to be part of other solutions.
You could watch the rally for yourself.
"You were, you know, actually served as a member, as a Republican."
"But another race where you had a blind spot was North Dakota, where you did see Rick Becker, who was just objectively the America first anti-establishment candidate, even pro-Trump candidate."
That was a fun clip.
And Harris was terrible on Fox News the other night.
So do not let the media gaslight you.
And I think we're really seeing her push that and this media blitz.
"And for people who say, I don't know, I don't know if I can vote for Donald Trump, the one thing that you cannot question is his children."
So there's not a whole lot in the world right now that doesn't rely on petroleum.
"Obviously, we know he was forced to."
We'll bring you more on the race for the White House.
I don't know whether bosses would like that.
We understand that that's fine.
"So half a point in the polling average He's up in Trafalgar Wall Street Journal Inside her advantage Emerson tip and Rasmussen reports and that's pretty good for him He's tied North Star opinion research as you can see here, but you might slow doesn't have many respondents So it's not too bad for Trump, but he's down to in Quinnipiac and three New York Times, Indiana obviously, those are left leaning pollsters in terms of previous track record, even though they nailed 2022 up and So I don't think they're the best pollsters for the rust belt, but that is like the good news for Harris Obviously Rasmussen is not that good of a pollster, but still they did have Biden up three So, you know that is it is something good for Trump."
Now to put this straight he has not been a supporter of Donald Trump for some time.
Both campaigns are concentrating on key swing stages which have historically played a significant role in election outcomes.
The margin of error is 2.7 percent.
So our pollster here at ABC thinks that it's basically on par with what we've seen before.
It's going to be huge in Arizona where abortion is on the ballot.
"It means now now corporate polls are showing that Donald Trump is back, baby."
"Oh, for sure."
Now we have less than eight months to go and Donald Trump is leading in Pennsylvania.
Donald Trump sees power as nothing more than a means to his ends.
"We are living in a time where evil is literally called good, and good is evil."
"Well, what an experience."
"Team Biden opened 14 offices across Pennsylvania in March alone and says it's working with more than 1,700 volunteers in the Commonwealth."
"Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg."
You're choking the industry and you're choking that economy that way and not allowing that to happen.
But he's got some of the same cadences and everything else.
They never did.
"If you send Reuben Gayle to the Senate, he'll vote to restore the reproductive freedom that women had for nearly 50 years."
"No, these are brand new voters."
"Where I am in San Francisco, homelessness has become a real problem."
But Pennsylvania rapidly becoming the biggest humiliation for Trump and Republicans.
That's one of the things I feel like we've been missing a lot of recently.
A lot of them said that they were kind of disaffected Democrats and were looking for kind of a new home.
They are happy.
"I mean, seriously, insider advantage back in 2020, the same time period had a D plus three."
"And a lot of times in this particular part of the world, you're going to be over there on the left."
Donald Trump has not won a popular vote in the elections where he's been at the top of the ballot.
We have a state director.
"And Chris, I do need to point out, and I agree with Governor Davis, that, you know, there are 67 counties in Pennsylvania."
Patel believes that Harris' approach to housing policy will address the needs of the growing urban population and provide more opportunities for homeownership.
"Crooks, he just looked like that incel type teenager, early 20-something male that probably didn't have any friends, bullied, not great luck with the women and turns for whatever reason to violence and gets politically polarized and radicalized and all that."
Take action now before it's too late.
"But I think what it showed beyond all that stuff behind the scenes is like, he's not a normal guy who can carry himself normally and have a normal conversation."
Hashtag blessed.
Knows it inside and out.
That's a four-point swing.
"And so basically, right now is that their Democrats are being very competitive in Arizona, but they know it's one of the tougher states of the six battleground states."
"Harris led in three out of the seven polls, with points ranging from one to two."
"Obviously, a bunch of ancestral Democrats, they became Republicans."
It might ultimately come down to which candidate can deliver a new RV to Clarence Thomas first.
Then Donald Trump takes the mic again.
"I mean, we know the guy likes Big Macs and Filet-O-Fish and he's used the word love to describe the way he feels about the food there before."
Take a listen to some of what he said over the weekend.
But the likelihood of turnout lags than that of white voters.
"So he dropped out of the race, said he's going to support Trump, and then found out he can't get off the ballot."
And that's the type of ethos we need from the president who's going to be looking out for all Americans.
"But there is a feeling in some parts of the country that those numbers that they see, that the stock market, for example, doesn't necessarily affect them."
And that's why I'm running because I think career politicians like Bob Casey are really hurting our great country.
That I don't understand.
Kamala Harris received 49 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 46 percent.
"Kamala Harris has borrowed Trump's homework a couple of times, but otherwise, she has, at this point, and this is inexplicable, even for the Kamala Harris campaign."
"So I apologize, but yeah, yeah."
"Oh yeah, this thing, this was funny, uh, with Alexa."
"Now down the ballot, Republicans managed to flip the governor's office in Nevada in 2022, and they also received more votes for US House in those midterms than Democrats for the first time in decades."
"These people who are not part of the 1% who are not corporations, why they would think it's in their economic self-interest to vote Republican is beyond me."
And so I personally am definitely very afraid of like the Trump overperformance because he always overperforms by two or three.
"So now, once you see that, I think it's clear, like secretly right now, Kamala Harris is screaming after her fifth glass of Chardonnay into a pillow right now, screaming at the top of her lungs."
"And the thing about that is, you know, these voters are going to get older."
He's a misogynist.
"They're so obsessed with us and with NATO because they know as long as they have the United States and NATO, they could pretty much do whatever they want because the United States is the biggest superpower."
So just not now.
I'm a runner.
"Both Harris and Trump are putting Pennsylvania in the spotlight, knowing that the state's voters could very well decide the outcome of the election."
Why do I share that with you?
This would be a 3-point overperformance for Harris compared to Biden's winning margin in 2020.
So you have to exercise judgment when you do that.
We appreciate your time.
"In addition to that, he's being joined by Elon Musk on the trail as well in Pennsylvania."
"Does she need to differentiate herself a little bit, show maybe a specific vision that is separate from the work that she had as vice president underneath President Biden?"
This is a political liability for Republicans and specifically for Donald Trump.
The margin of error in our CBS News polling is 2.3 points.
It's not because of anything that the government is on private land.
"Yes, I have decided."
" Welcome to the Power Shift, where we break down the tectonic shifts of global politics with razor-sharp insight."
More resurfaced tweets are even more disturbing.
She is me and I am her.
"But as you hit on Connell, these counties are so important."
"And over the weekend, he talked about elite forces, National Guard, other things in our country being deployed to not only deport those suspected of or charged with or implicated in crimes, but others as well."
"So I want to start off with a little bit of breaking news here, and that is that Donald Trump, who frames himself as the leader of the party of the military, he was just rebuked by the army, an almost unprecedented rebuke here by the US army, after an altercation broke out at Arlington because he was trying to use his visit there as a photo op and there was some shoving that ensued."
And I love the fact that you're multifaceted and you stay busy in different things.
Anyways.
The registered voters have traditionally led Democratic.
My dog's been stolen.
So what had happened was they couldn't count the votes until election day.
I gave him lunch.
"So hypothetically speaking, if we have 100,000 mail-in ballots, we have to deal with double the amount of envelopes, which is a long process."
"You're just gonna list a bunch of fake titles for Belichick's book that are based on actual, you know, famous books."
That ends today.
I think she's got some momentum.
"But because the expectation game, everyone, it actually came out as a wash. Today, everyone is expecting Joe Biden to do so poorly based on his recent performances."
Harris offered it to him Tuesday morning as campaign cameras rolled.
"And on top of that, the same Eternals, they have Trump up by Wisconsin by a decent amount."
He's a Trump voter.
And that's going to do it for the morning agenda today.
I know people in the fracking industry aren't falling for.
"You know Kamala Harris said just the other day in an interview that if she could do it all over again, what would she change?"
"Also, please remember to share this video with your friends and family if you really, really, really like the video."
But it's also the right thing to do in his first and foremost job as commander in chief.
"This is a chance to bring out that joy, turn the page and look to the future."
"You know, who gets excited about this kind of stuff?"
"And also on top of that with the voter registration with all the recent polls where Trump's outperforming his numbers in 2020 and 2016 and he won in 2016 and he barely lost in 2020, Pennsylvania is looking really good that you can see the data with Biden winning the state by 81 K. This is huge news for Trump's election chances because it means democratic mail and enthusiasm is falling off and not just by more than Republicans and raw numbers, but at twice the rate 2020 was a pandemic year."
So I'm calling on Congress to pass this bill against my desk immediately.
Whoopi Goldberg.
That's when members of Congress meet to certify the electoral votes from the 2024 presidential election.
"Please like this video down below, comment down below, subscribe to the channel, hit the bell for notifications so you never miss another video."
Kamala Harris is losing ground to Donald Trump with less than three weeks to go for election day.
"Just honestly, do your research."
"In other words, talking about immigration, sure, which a lot of people say is a problem, but also saying that he's going to use the powers of the federal government to go after his political enemies."
There was the smile and the laugh.
"I mean, she's a criminal."
"I feel like it was hard for me, but I was brave enough to be without my mom."
They're just totally forgetting about the latinx.
And so making life affordable again is something that I'm hearing a lot from our politicians.
"So even if these Bloomberg and Quinnipiac polls are not actually outside the consensus, by some miracle, the RCP average is really Harris plus point five, not because of two big outliers, but because the polls have a consensus."
This is the same question that J.D.
You have a public record of when somebody dies.
"And when he's not complaining, he's trying to sell you stuff."
This place has certainly become an important symbolic location for Trump supporters around the country.
So the show the margin again is much closer than that.
He's going to be there a lot in recent weeks.
That's the bluest of these seven states and you compare the polls now to the polls back then.
"We'll fracture the well and then following the frack, we'll come in and drill out those plugs and then we'll run the production to be able to bring the oil or gas online with this current."
"Bobby Eberle, Chip Franklin, thank you both so much for joining."
You can have that conversation.
And that path to breaking through might begin with answering the question posed to you in the first place.
I'm pretty sure something bad.
I would imagine they're comparing where we're at right now in early September of 2024 with where it was in 2020.
Somebody else is running her shit.
That's called Marxism.
Now one person said to be in the running for Harris's VP Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.
"And on these issues, Donald Trump and Republicans for large clearly have the advantage."
"Look, I think it is more of the same from Donald Trump."
"And I don't even think Harris is really that strong of a candidate when it comes to these like, you know, millennial men, for example, which, you know, typically when they grow up as well, they're going to be, you could argue, moving to the right."
Don't they?
I'll even give you an example.
"His problem is that he has less money on him and the Republican apparatus has given him this cold shoulder at the neocon level, the party leadership."
A bid to ensure his allies and organized labor will bolster Harris' run for president.
How would that affect your timeline for thinking about your political future?
And we have to be honest with ourselves about that.
"And they can have a beer and talk about it, a piece of pizza, a pizza pie, and all get along."
There's about 10 different bills that are pro-immigrant that are currently in the legislature that we've asked his administration to support.
"And to give you an example, the inflation reduction act was only passed with about, I think, $270 billion."
"In summary, Donald Trump's recent legal victory in Pennsylvania has the potential to influence the election in several significant ways."
Prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high.
Josh Shapiro as her running mate.
"As Peter Henline, DeSantis supporter, who is still a big supporter of democracy and logic and common sense."
"Pennsylvania would win the election for Donald Trump, assuming he gets North Carolina and Georgia."
We have a Democratic House and a Republican Senate.
"And even since January 6th and all the rhetoric that has been out there, the negative rhetoric about multiculturalism and bringing just looking at the difference now and bringing and what you're seeing here at the DNC and the support behind all cultures, all people, all walks of life."
Emergency responders determined high levels of carbon monoxide were found throughout the building with levels up to 300 parts per million of carbon monoxide recorded in the theater.
"And yet, a lot of the response to it from his supporters was to just agree and not really bad an eye about it."
"I mean, it was pretty amazing for me at the roll call just to look around state by state and see all colors and creeds and backgrounds."
OK. Fifty nine will probably be OK. And this looks like a Harris point.
She wasn't tough on crime.
It's crazy that that's an acceptable standard.
"That is really good news for Kamala Harris and also just goes to show that these are pollsters that come from very different backgrounds, very different funding sources, very different methodologies in understanding the Pennsylvania electorate."

And Donald Trump has been part of that.
"And guys, look, even if you're a MAGA, if you didn't think that he was a lunatic before, you really think that Donald Trump at 78 300 some odd pounds is better looking than Kamala Harris."

"But overall, it was a good night for Donald Trump."
Real great.

"So the Republicans are too dependent on day of voting, whereas the Democrats will have banked millions of votes prior to then."
"And the other one I pointed out in the video, this is incredible, too."
You are by no means middle class and it's crazy.
What exactly are we seeing here?
"Security was exceptionally tight at the rally, reflecting the heightened tensions following the recent attempt on Trump's life."

"And so it's a long time coming that we've had this, to have this reform."
It really is.
So like you just poke a little bit at the bio and it starts to come apart.
And polling this late in 2020 didn't quite show it.
"And this is a county that even JD Vance won despite, you know, underperforming statewide."
"There's another woman in the states talking about how a news page, a blog page was literally making him that what is not by literally a detail in the picture, changing it to black and white just to make it seem that what it's not."
Let's talk about fracking.
It has been nonstop attacks in that Senate race.
We just need the team in place to start working on that.
You might be voting for Harris.
"I drive a Jeep, right?"

"I mean, this is malpractice."
"This Pennsylvania, no matter what, has been a generally reliably vote for them in almost all the recent presidential elections, except for 2016, right, which they were surprised by."

"We make choices in terms of TV, in terms of writing."
And now to the surprise I encountered while trying to set up interviews for this story.
It's an open primary in the state of Indiana.
Biden and Clinton were winning these polls by a lot more.
"These areas, often seen as bellwethers, play an instrumental role in the electoral calculus."
I like that also.

"He just wants to, he wants to do it."
"Today with the stock market hitting a new record high, the Harris campaign highlighted a survey of economists in the Wall Street Journal who agreed that Donald Trump's policies would drive up prices, interest rates, and the national debt while hurting manufacturing jobs."
So this is like dead heat in a lot of these polls.
Is my dollar going to go further?
"I see shades of the Hillary Clinton campaign with the arrogance of a Democratic Party, out of touch with the electorate."
None of these are Pennsylvanians like the top three candidates are not really Pennsylvanians.
I have.
You're a very popular governor and you're a Democratic governor in a state that is a pretty closely politically divided state.
"I think Pennsylvania has been really, really important for the Democratic Party for quite some time."
It's a joke.
"Well, they definitely exist."
"So for example, back in May, Trump led independents by 10 points."

"That is good for Trump, but still the overall numbers spell it out."
That's where Penn State is.
"And it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by a national guard or if really necessary, by the military."
"But at the end of the day, they all can talk about it and get along."
It certainly increases his visibility as a national player in both American politics and in Democratic politics.
"Like my in-laws, they like to watch actual cable television and like sitting there, being bombarded with those ads is maddening, especially, I think when we're watching the Phillies game, every single commercial break is just, it's literally Trump ad, Kamala ad, Dave McCormick ad, Bob Casey ad, then whoever the congressional candidate is, I'm like, I'm gonna lose my goddamn mind."
There's momentum for Harris.
"Well, the advantage has always been to the Democrats, at least in recent history, just based on voter registration."
That's what Kamala Harris will do.
Here's some of the photos.
"He gave a mini trade deal to China, but then China inflicted the coronavirus on the world and has not accounted for that or come clean about its origins."

"So I find it very interesting that the Biden campaign, they're launching this six figure ad by, you know, where they highlight Trump essentially slamming Haley over and over again."
"I think he's going to win independence in every single swing state, which is also going to help combat the advantage that the Democrats have in a state like Pennsylvania."
"It's completely unfair to have people coming from all over the world, not just Latin America, Iran, Russia, China."
I think it's a little weird if you don't mind me saying it's.
You've both been involved in politics for quite a while.
"Traveling with him recently, Laura Loomer, a conspiracy theorist who last year insisted 9-11 was an inside job."
And so I think the economic message is really important.

The eventual winner of these states could very well determine who sits in the White House come January 2025.
We'd like to take over the telephone system of the United States.
I think he will deliver the state to her if she is selected.
"I mean, we've talked about how JD Vance was probably the worst pick that Donald Trump could have done for Vice President."
Let's begin first with Jake Rosen and then we'll pivot to Nydia Kavaza.
A photo like in front of the painting here.
I can't stand the guy.
"The New York Post observed that Shapiro has come under fire from the left for his support for school choice in Pennsylvania, but he's lost support from Republicans, too after he reversed his position on a school choice bill, which he previously supported."
It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country.
One final race to watch I would say is as things develop over the next couple of weeks before the primary in Georgia between Brian Kemp and David Perdue.
And I think definitely is why the race is so close and why Trump is running so neck and neck with Harris.
"Yeah, this is a New York Times-Ciena College poll."
"As long for free forever, as long as you own a computer that can run it."
"So there's a tremendous support here with the people coming in, regardless of the color cookie."
And the Tesla CEO immediately took a pot shot at current U.S. President Joe Biden.
"We're all humans, human endeavor means you will have partisan beliefs, what they choose to put in their polling averages is unlike what we see on 538, which has Kamala Harris ahead in the 538 average, unlike what we see on VoteHub, unlike what we see on other organizations that do the same work."
"We don't have electric in this country, but we have all the gas you can use."
"Thankfully, HIMSS is changing that by providing affordable access to ED treatment all online."
Free enterprise.
"And if you look at Pennsylvania politically, you know, Democrats did very well there in 2022, in part because Republicans had sort of like uniquely poor candidates in Dr. Oz and what's the other dude's name who ran for governor?"
Just look at their numbers in 2020.
"Kamala Harris, as we kind of have covered, is in this virtually tied race right now."
"And to a certain degree, I get it."
"This part of the state is Scranton, Pennsylvania."
"And then another thing the campus is doing that's pissing me off is she's trying to, she's trying to be everything to everybody."
Whereas Trump almost kind of invites it on himself where he does so many.
"And because, you know, there's reports that he may do a little pit stop here."
And they both join me now.
"He helped to provide Starlink dishes to hurricane-ravaged areas in the U.S., but has bashed FEMA, saying that it's blocking the deliveries or slowing them down."
They tried to kill the man.
He has been trying to find a way to claim ownership of this issue without the liability.
He's saying that he would use the military to go after them.
"So the more you look at it, the more it becomes apparent that Trump's in a good position here."
"Recently, you were writing more about the history of the blue wall, how Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin have voted the same way in every presidential election since 1980, save one."
It's not quite as close as the presidential race.
"Vice President Harris hailed her new running mate as a veteran, six term congressman and two term governor who is prepared to take on their rivals."
"Joining me now is Pennsylvania Democratic Congressman, Krista Luzio."
Win a primary.

I was going to do a video.
They're going to ask her about immigration.
"And look, Erie's also had some economic challenges over the last summer."
"We like that about him, but he doesn't at the same time want to endorse candidates that he feels like even with his endorsement can lose."
Because shutting down fracking will also harm them.
I think she's doing it in a lot of reasons because the race is that close.
I saw the crowds of Rochester yesterday.
We know that former President Donald Trump won this state back in 2016.
 We begin this hour on the campaign trail and concerns surrounding election security.
"When one reporter attempted to shout a question, they were told to not disrupt the program, Fox 43 later confirmed that the media was denied access to the Democratic vice presidential nominee."
"But his team does still believe that they have the momentum, which is part of the reason they've been very quiet over the last couple of weeks ever since that debate."
You mentioned that the Senate race between Bob Casey and Dave McCormick is not as firm as some of the others.
"I don't know 70,000 votes 80,000 votes perhaps and in 2016 Trump won it very narrowly And so it used to be predominantly Republican then it was voting Democratic for about 20 years and then Now it's the last two elections."
And Donald Trump then tries to talk about gas and cooking.
"And by the way, also terrible staff work."
The Biden administration also plans to roll out new measures to combat gender-based violence.
"So if you do the math on all the polls, Trump is in a very good position."
It could be like 55% Democrat or something like that.
"He worked construction, worked as a meat packer, anything to help his family."
So I know like personally we're not thrilled about the environmental impact of it but we know that the money is important to people.
Morgan's support is rooted in her advocacy for workers' rights and her belief that Harris will fight for fair wages and better working conditions.
And we're just getting started.
"Those people are more dangerous, the enemy from within, than Russia and China."
"Her recent interview with CNN's Dana Bash, alongside running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, saw no major missteps, but Kennedy's critique highlights ongoing concerns about her leadership."
Nice and loud.
Here's Harris answering questions to the press and this is a market change.
"Yeah, Pennsylvania polling is trash, especially in October."
"Wow, it's hot out."
It is narrow.
"And now his trade policies, particularly with tariffs, are basically just gibberish."
"I mean, look at the then partisanship if she gets elected, it's all out the window."
And we're not trying to go back to where Donald Trump took us several years ago.
Because as we know this is pretty much the electoral map.
They should be at 65% of the total.
What's Joe Biden going to do?
Some people are saying there is no lens that these politicians are not going to go to be able to get a seat at that position.
I was going to ask the girl.
Hispanic should go down to 59.
We're going to actually look at voter registration numbers and previous election results numbers and show how likely it is for the Democrats to win in Pennsylvania.
"She validates the saying, anything is possible if you put your mind to it, you work hard, and you never give up."
"You know, they say I didn't behave."
Stay tuned for that.
This was a super no margin for Trump and Clinton.
"And a state where more than six million votes will be cast this fall, perhaps exceeding 10,000."
"If we give Pennsylvania five points, Kamala Harris put in the lean column that cuts off Trump's most important swing state for winning this election."
These are civil rights organizations.
Two thirds of people have skin irritation and then over two billion plastic razors enter our landfills in the United States alone.
"Like that's the number one, you know, most generic thing you can say about someone if you're trying to make people vote for them, she's a strong candidate with a great track record."
"This was something that the Black women came out and said, do you think she's been able to convince the Black voters in America that she is the person that they'll have to rely their faith in?"
"Joining us now White House reporter for Bloomberg, Akayla Gardner."
It's always August.
They're both in good shape.
And we can expect an all-out battle in the coming weeks as they make their final pitches to voters.
Casey's been in the Senate a long time since 2007 and McCormick made the most of that.
"Eleanor Russell â€“ $15 million Topping the list is Eleanor Russell, a billionaire philanthropist with a long history of supporting democratic causes."
"He's a great guy, great young athlete."
"And I decided, you know what?"
"So she's in a mud hut basically or a mud, not a mud hut, but like a mud puddle."
40 and then past that we're all getting cuts.
"To me, the worst is the border, because it's like what they're doing is they're destroying our country."
We love our country.
They will turn America into a third world country.
"So there might be something kind of going on there where they seem to be really, really heavily in favor of Trump, especially for like Arizona and Georgia and those states in North Carolina."
It flipped back to President Biden in 2020 and now it's up for grabs again.
So I thank you all so very much for what you are doing.
"This is from MS 13 DNC, also known as MS NBC."
We always answer the call.
"It's about who we are, how we treat each other."
"So Trump knows that if he wins here, he's on a really good path to maybe winning."
"Because if Democrats were in fact gaining a real surge, I'm not talking about an artificial one being pushed by the media."
"The Oz campaign put out some ads ridiculing Federman's health, although Oz personally said it wasn't me doing that, but it was still attached to the campaign at the debate."
Why are you talking about her looks for so long?
They're not necessarily pounding the national numbers as hard.
Very accurate in 2020.
Look at what they're doing.
"They want to support a president who understands that we have to end mass shooting at schools, but also holds accountable a government that decimated every university across Gaza."
"We should be optimistic that if we all get out and vote, Harris will win."
And so this is it's hard to know how many lessons that we can draw from this.
And some of them are distinctly partisan.
I get caught 15 years.
Trump was horrid.
They actually have a good reputation as far as being church-going and being hard-working.
"The governor's office reached a $295,000 settlement with the accuser."
"As we know in the US elections, it's all about that electoral college vote and amongst the seven swing states, none has more of those electoral votes than Pennsylvania."
Even Pittsburgh.
In one room we see the span of the MAGA coalition.
And then you've also got stuff in Nevada and Michigan.
Both candidates therefore suffer unique situations which really you don't generally see in presidential campaigns.
"And today's Iris Tao brings us more from Atlanta, Georgia."
"There's mechanics, there's restaurants, there's bars, there's truck drivers."
"So it's very, very low."
What do you make of that?
The crowd cheered when he did and he appeared to have some bit of blood on his head at the time.
He urged them to embrace women in power and to pick Kamala Harris as their next President.
"Now you're getting multiple polls, some liberal polls coming out saying Trump's leading Michigan when the entire liberal narrative was that, Oh my God, she's going to win Michigan."
"Well, I think the reason Trump is here is show strength, that he will not be chased away."
"Again, you have folks who very much do support the vice president."
Her prior track record was alarming as a senator and attorney general in California.
"I mean, I'm sorry, Pennsylvania."
"Across battlegrounds, they're in a virtual high."
"So whether this election is making you feel excited or scared or hopeful or frustrated or anything in between, do not just sit back and hope for the best."
"The reason for that is is that if former President Donald Trump takes back Arizona and Georgia where his numbers are good, this proverbial blue wall that you have up here is so critical."
Those folks are working really hard and doing a nice job.
"I've interviewed him a bunch of times, meaning a veteran that he's been there a while."
"Like Harris, he is also a former attorney general."
"The only person who could control the weather is Beyonce, OK?"
We did have a special guest come on stage at one point.
"Both candidates have taken very hardened positions, maximalist positions."
The race started out in the teens.
Trump and Harris are exactly tied when all of those states are combined.
"Do you believe it's tied in Pennsylvania, Selena?"
"Because having people divided and angry and aggrieved and resentful, he figures that boosts his chances to get elected."
That's the bad news.
That could be fun.
"And she's such an authentic, nice, warm person."
"And you just don't, you're supposed to be attacking Kamala Harris on her policies like immigration cramps."
We've had enough of that negativity.
So you can look at 10.
And 73% of likely voters say they are very enthusiastic about supporting him.
And so that is an extraordinary thing.
And he's campaigning in states.
I think Pennsylvania only 40% are college grads.
Everybody just kind of say what you want to hear.
You talked about what's been going on in Pennsylvania.
You need everybody.
What did somebody say?
"Today, we'll walk you through the results of 14 polls that could decide the next president of the United States."
"And yet he did two points worse, nearly a 10 point difference that if it was any other type of national circumstance, J.D."
"Are we to now read that the big money in America, the super PACs are all backing Kamala Harris?"
"Polls show that the former president has erased Kamala Harris' gains in the key battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and even Nevada."
They each backed Trump or Joe Biden in 2020 by at least 10 percentage points.
I was former president Obama wrapping up we're at times what we're at times passionate emotional remarks in Pittsburgh the first stop on his sprint through swing stage four Kamala Harris
Now the polling is neck and neck.
"And should he eye a 2028 presidential campaign or beyond, certainly more people are going to know who he is."
Michael Ruhle did alright.
"The eighth poll was conducted between October 2 and 10 by American Pulse Research and Polling among 1,193 likely voters."
Also want to ask you about some of the other foreign policy issues that came up during the debate.
"In the presidential election that will take place in 2024, he highlighted his state as a crucial battleground that will be contested."
So two eighteen cartons on top of each other.
Trump is down to 47.7.
"Hell, it's actually the opposite."
It is a crazy thing to do and you shouldn't do it no matter who you want to win.
"First off, I just want to say I love how much people our age are in the politics and talking about it on these social media spaces."
"I'm going to find this slide here because what you see is it depends on what you think has been going on in the country in relation to, here we go, gender equality efforts."
"Meanwhile, the violence continued unabated Sunday with Israeli strikes killing 21, including six children, according to Palestinian health authorities."
"GS strategy group poll conducted over the same period September 19 to 25, with the same for 170 for likely voters, reveals Harris leading Trump by a single point, with Harris at 50% and Trump at 49%."
"Well, there's one more thing this piece mentions that I think often gets overlooked and it's the shy Trump voter phenomenon."
"T on the outer banks were h the costs down there are roof, there's not enough so much that needs to hap get our gas prices down."
So in Pennsylvania there's almost a civil war brewing and this is right at the end of the election.
I just think that it brought people together in 2020.
"I mean, I know what we all know what they're going to ask questions."
Good morning to you.
You see how that works.
The series of explosive noises shuttered through this crowd.
"I think she's it's gonna be a hopefully not a tie, but I think it's gonna be close race."
"He was kind of excusing the companies, I guess, either directly or indirectly, excusing companies for engaging in price coaching like it's, you know, it's OK to to gouge someone."
"And for those that don't believe me that these are bad polls back in 2020, Franklin and Marshall claimed Biden was going to win Pennsylvania by six, which, by the way, back in 2016, their final poll was Clinton plus 11."
Republican voters who are concerned about election integrity are likely to view this victory as a sign that their concerns are being addressed.
And not just Harris plus one.
"He's here, America's favorite fish."
Nancy Pelosi likewise denounced the speech in shameful terms.
She's gonna destroy the oil industry.
"Yeah, the polls haven't looked too good there for them."
What can I have everybody?
A lot of Democratic officials and party leaders are worried that Liu doesn't have the right kind of relationships to mobilize those crucial voters.
"Inside her advantage, Whitmer plus one."
We're just reading the headlines.
I'm going to continue to dig in.
"Right now, what are the key issues that see economy?"
And this tool allows you to understand your perspective a little bit better so you can better educate your friends who are brainwashed by the mainstream media.
So we definitely don't want her in.
"So it's not only the rhetoric, it's also the policy proposals."
Trump is doing better.
"Look, she is smart as hell, number one."
And now and now it's here and they're saying never mind.
You got Shapiro.
Trump was.
Harris going after Trump for his recent comments referring to some Americans as quote enemies from within.
"I'm like, are you insane?"
"We talked about the election polls, and we talked about emergency prep."
"So he's coming back here to Butler, nearly three months after that first assassination attempt."
He has asserted this.
But Shapiro signs shells to be used in the war in Ukraine.
We've seen lower numbers than that.
Great picture of Trump in the window.
"Now with voter registration, you have to be very careful."
So is that gonna negate the post campaign bump?
"Comment, like, subscribe."
They're your school?
"Let the waves crash into that copper tone, bronzing cream covered face and make a big slick all over the sea."
"I mean, you look, you can have the opinion of rich folks and that's fine, but we all know how people that got money, we know like a lot of your white liberals, we got money."
I can't control myself.
It's going to be huge.
A rate cut soon.
They will continue to work if we give this ticket a chance.
She says the provision took away the right of city residents to govern themselves.
Thank you so much for joining us again.
"Even at one point, Casey was saying, you know, you even claim that you grew up as a farmer and then that's not even true."
"First, it can be said that Pennsylvania is considered an indispensable battleground state in U.S. presidential elections due to its swing voter nature."
"Anyway, so check this out."
But these open primaries coupled with a lot of big money.
Both candidates are descending on Pennsylvania Monday.
Duh.
Democrats have done it all to themselves.
"And that's why they're expecting to see lots of travel for her in the coming months as they try to cut into some of the margins, especially when it comes to the economy, they're going to tout her economic plan and what she has proposed to cut down taxes for middle class voters, as well as grocery prices, but it's going to be a task that they need to fill the next two months if they want to win this election."
That happens on every network.
"And I say, yeah, yeah, it was good because it was my economy that I gave to them."
"Meanwhile, sources say Trump's preparation has included reviewing policy positions with advisers."
"At the top left of the screen, there's also a Discord server if you go ahead and join on the screen so the video can watch the playlist of my 2024 presidential election analysis videos."
"But I'm really about to start reacting to all this stuff going on, bro."
"And with the recent polls, you know, there were some bad Republican internal polls last night that came out."
"But I think Trump is playing very smart politically, saying he's for exceptions, he said they ended the debate."
So this is a pretty good number that we have here in Pennsylvania.
I'm Sean Mooney.
We've heard this time and time again.
"And they also believe they have been very strong when it comes to fundraising, as well as campaign advertising on television and really building out some of these field offices."
Good morning to our friends at the rundown.
"But we have right here for these two guys, and we see the Hill, Marist."
"What we saw was a small Harris lead, but within the margin of error becoming a race that is way, way, way too close to call at this particular point."
"And so a lot of strengths, among other options."
They should be in places like Georgia.
"But these numbers right now are so bad for her that how could anyone say as of now, Harris is the clear favorite in Pennsylvania?"
"We participated in just talking to a lot of wonderful patriots there, praying for our President."
"If prescribed, your medication ships directly to you for free and in discreet packaging."
"Well Trump had a Pennsylvania rally yesterday and he held up the, not held up, but he had the girl that came out that prepared his big chart that he says saved his life and it was a rip roaring rally and he let come on, there is habit."
"And in fact, these numbers are going to get even worse for Democrats because guess what?"
"Dana and I were just talking about, I want to get your take on this."
"Another subject that the governor addressed was freedom, which is a theme that is regularly brought up in Republican speech and is frequently a key component of conversation."
"Look, polling will bounce around, but we're in a very close race now."
That really is.
"Social issues, including abortion rights and gun control, are also likely to play a significant role in the 2020 four-election."
Yeah I mean I think I think that's spot on.
What does your polling suggest?
I was also surprised at how close Harris now is in these swing states.
"So those things could really come into play to pick off moderate voters, independent voters and undecided voters."
"So Libby, we were just showing some video from a campaign event yesterday that the president was talking about."
"What do you think about the exhausted line, the sort of uniter, not divider approach, Charlie?"
We saw Elizabeth Warren confront it very head on and really challenge men to take a look at her policies and vote for her.
"He came from a purple district, a Trump district."
What are you doing here?
"But the much more conservative, much more authentic conservative in Adam Morgan fell short to William Timmons."
"Pennsylvania has long been considered not only a battleground state, but perhaps the key battleground state in this election."
"They have found cases where, quote, dead people have voted."
I think that he wins on a tie.
"Pennsylvania is the second largest natural gas producer in the country, and Trump has attacked Harris relentlessly for her previous support of a fracking ban."
"You sidestep that crap, but you want us to go hard to paint and support this sister, as you call her, even though her family has a history of being slave owners themselves in Jamaica, right?"
The number one issue for me is we gotta protect our homeland.
And it would confirm the three-point split that we're expecting between the popular vote and the electoral college.
That was one of the polls that had John Federman defeating Dr. Oz by four percentage points in the final poll.
That never happened.
Harris has made impressive gains among younger voters.
"I mean, those two, those two obviously very liberal cities are Democrat run seat, but in between there and everywhere else in the state of Pennsylvania really is a very conservative state after all."
The only reason why the polls were in off by like 10 or 11 points in 2020 in many cases were because you had these pollsters in the mix.
It's a double standard that these people have.
But she's even worse for the Jews.
And I know we're talking about VP picks on a video about rust belt polls.
And how do you see it going in the future the ads in 1988 and that whole campaign?
Somebody come up here and take them.
"And I think what Nikki Haley is hitting on, which is so important, is swing voters will decide this election."
Razors produced by Henson have a blade that extends only point zero zero one three inches past the shave plane.
They're just as bad.
"And I'm like, no, this is never gonna be a five point race."
They're from Japan.
"Kamala Harris received 45% of the vote and Donald Trump, 48%."
And not in her like she didn't do anything absolutely wrong.
It's much easier to work under a Trump administration than this administration by far.
What's particularly interesting in this state is the way in which the electorate has shifted.
"If you guys did enjoy this video, smash the like button down below."
I'm non-binary.
Let me know how you also doing in the comments.
"And if he's running, I will, he's got my vote."
That's coming from public polls.
He's okay.
I just know I want him to get in and I don't want Camilla in.
"Every once in a while, one will blow up."
I think she does.
"So if you were supposed to make, I don't know, a grand a month off of social security and that's what you paid in, you're only going to be collecting like $700."
" Hey everybody, I am your host Alad reporting here in Pennsylvania outside of this Trump rally Let's go talk some of his support to see what's going on."
"I'm going to bring him in tonight, but the scene has been described as chaotic."
Thank you Pennsylvania.
So I did previously report on how Kamala Harris is actually already gearing up for a legal battle for the election results after.
"In early June, when he was campaigning in Las Vegas, in Nevada, a state with the highest number of tipped hourly service workers, he said we should stop taxing people's tips."
"In our top story, jury selection begins Thursday in Los Angeles for Hunter Biden's federal tax trial."
Wisconsin accounts for 10.
But what we're seeing right now is a Harris plus four would look like this.
"A beautiful town of Asheville, North Carolina, one of my favorite places in the country."
"Since the end of the Cold War in 1989, America has created about 51 million new jobs."
Same poll had Biden up and sit by similar margins before Democrats forced him out.
And tomorrow will be another one.
So President Joe Biden spoke with Trump after the situation.
It's all insane.
What are the the major economic issues facing voters right now in the Keystone state?
"Of the electorate in the midterms, but this is a presidential year."
I've seen a whole bunch of you being a musician and an artist and all that.
"I am Brandon Finnegan, co-founder of Decision Desk HQ."
"They say it's great, but it's got one problem."
"I'm looking at Trump and what he has on the red tie with the white shirt and the, and the yellow, like the golden arts to this type situation."
Let's get a photo.
"And in this case, 75,000."
There's an excitement to Kamala.
I don't expect that we're going to have a result on election night.
And we never ran to be the first anything.
I don't know if you can hear this.
 Pennsylvania is the most pivotal battleground in the race for the White House.
So now you have people that want to be here.
And I don't blame her because it's not a good one.
"The debate, I think we saw with her own eyes, I think she did pretty well against him."
Would you like two in the back?
Dramatic is the right way to sum up this election so far.
All of these things appear to have failed.
We don't want to.
"Her seventh visit to the western part of the state, Kamala Harris, used Donald Trump's own words to prosecute him."
"Former White House aide to George H. W. Bush, Joe Watkins, believes Shapiro should be at the top of Harris's list."
He wants the middle class to pay the price for another huge tax cut that would mostly help him and his country club buddies.
Jessica.
They call you weird.
"So yeah, man, Obama about to talk shit about Trump."
"Faint political writer at the Los Angeles Times, Sima Mehta, told us both candidates are sharpening their attacks in those key states, even though, you know, obviously this is a national election, but ultimately it's going to come down to a handful of battleground states."
"All the guy cares about is doing the job and looking after you, the people he was elected to serve."
"I mean, I can tell you originally Republican leaders were looking at places like Ohio, places that are super red, that Donald Trump is expected to carry by a wide margin thinking that Sherrod Brown was frankly toast."
"Today's funding announcement is only going to help accelerate this great progress and ensure that even more communities across Pennsylvania have access to clean, safe, and affordable water."
"Oh, you're very stingy with that product."
"But if she adds in, say, Arizona along with Georgia, that's a possibility."
And this is the most important person in the most important state in the entire country right now.
Evidence.
"But, but kiddo, I want you to just take a look, OK?"
We send out a correction.
Otherwise he's got to pick off some really hard to reach states.
He blamed us for COVID.
He's talking about you.
"Like I said, you know, you got shot, you got shot here."
"Now, we were energy independent under Trump."
He also said he would pardon the January 6th rioters who attacked police officers if they are innocent.
"If I were in Harris' situation, I would think very strongly about the difficulties that some women experience being in a top-level position, and having men around them that have to be satisfied with being second, third, or answering to a woman, she told the outlet."
Now all of a sudden they're aligned with Kamala.
He's not OK.
"Governor Shapiro, thank you so much for taking the time."
That very same clip unearthed and broadcast by Fox News is now making waves on social media.
America has an electoral college system in which each state is given a number of votes roughly in line of the size of its population.
It's disgraceful.
"But Chester County, this is the college-educated, suburbanite, traditional Republican community."
That's not what the CDC recommends right now.
"Philadelphia city council member, Kendra Brooks, a member of the working, it's because they're Democrats, we're using their terms."
That's the reports.
"So no, we're not going back to that."
"It was also friends and coworkers and neighbors and even political opponents, people on the other side of the aisle."
"But listen, you know, these races are closed, James."
Kill the winner before sundown to legally claim their multi-billion dollar jackpot.
"So Anthony, we just spoke with major about the push from the Harris campaign to court, particularly black male voters."
So voters here are largely Latino voters.
"Karine Jean-Pierre was lying about it too, straight face to doozy."
It's nerve-racking.
And I thought that's what was so compelling about Tim Walts' speech last night.

Here's the biggest reason.
Have you heard the story of King Midas?

It is nonetheless good news for Harris that she is a lead in this state.

Let's see what we got here.

Following Tuesday's fierce face-off.
This is not a complicated issue.
"What are you hearing about our current president, President Biden?"

But more people tell me about grocery bills where the price of bacon the price of lettuce the price of tomatoes they tell me And we're gonna do a lot of things But then 30 minutes in two attendees suffered medical emergencies a doctor please doctor the incidents shifted the mood prompting Trump to cut the question short and Instead play some of his favorite music.

Your thoughts on where the polling is at this stage of the election at this time?
I served the Marine Corps in combat.
"He needs to win back those supporters because, you know, Nikki Haley, she ends up winning one hundred and fifty seven thousand votes."
She's crazy.
"I mean, I thought Democrats, we were the party that was all about second chances and that we're not going to condemn somebody based on mistakes or things in that kind of situation."
You know I think that Kamala has a lot of good plans for the future and I think that since she wasn't the one that was mainly in charge you know even though she is vice president there is Congress and there is checks and balances so like she can't do everything I think that with her being more empowered president I think that she would be able to do a better job.
I believe that he will win the election.

"That's it for this one, folks!"
"As a matter of fact, very little of the polling numbers."

Harris has found strong support among Puerto Rican voters.
This doesn't happen all the time in Amish country.
What the hell is his name?

He says this was a chance for Shapiro to extend his name recognition beyond the Northeast.

"Let's bring in Nydia Kavaza, who is now breaking it down for the Harris campaign."
"She also has allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis, a very messy and dangerous situation."
I'll come back to that.
We're taking a look at the Rasmussen reports poll that was in the margin of error.
"But the thing about this cycle is that when you look at the polling, when you talk to some of these pollsters and folks who are in the focus groups actually talking to voters, the thing that is top of mind for them is actually not abortion."

I'm a PC master racer.
"In 2016, in 2020, Biden carried the county by about 1500 votes."
Seth.
"I think you were looking at the final three, none of them were really particularly that appealing."
Now Senator Casey is saying that he also just signed legislation that allowed abortions up into the ninth month.
They flipped parties.
And we're going to talk about the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.
I can't afford to purchase a whole animal this year.
Clean water.
We are now 25 days until the election.
"Al is leading that way, as are clerks all across Pennsylvania, Republican and Democrat alike, who are working very hard to make sure that we have integrity yet again in our process."
"Kamala is a general idiot, like worse than the normie mouth breather."
"So in a nutshell, Kamala Harris is lying about not wanting to ban fracking."
It's the only way to get the full picture.
"For one, the economy is top of mind for many voters."
So there's the criticism of how this interview was conducted in content as a reporter.
We'll just wait and we don't know necessarily what Wikipedia is basically saying here.
But these issues are cropping up.
The RNC was gutted.
Are we seeing the same for down ballot races or do you expect either Harris or Trump to do worse than their congressional counterparts on the ballot?
This is not the future we want.
This is the the official outside crowd report.
So I understand people feeling frustrated and feeling we can do better.
"He said about how he would vote, quote, he said first he would be voting no."
It's been a consistent move up.
"We are going to be talking about in this video, but it is important that we cover the fact that Donald Trump is pulled ahead in the state of Pennsylvania for the first time in a while that is with an outlier in there a Biden plus eight outlier."
It's part time jobs that aren't valuable.
The early voting looks very good.
"No, that's no warning sign to these people even though I think that's a much larger warning sign, especially as these protests are kind of ramping up because this conflict in the Middle East is showing no signs of stopping."
Now what will happen is throughout the whole night on election night every single one of these counties will be all of them through all state they will be reporting in their election counts from all of the polling stations and all of these counties over here will be the first to report in and so as you're watching whatever station they'll be showing that Pennsylvania is red red red red red and everybody will start freaking out and that's because so many of these counties are reporting in and they're all reporting in huge numbers for Donald Trump but here's what you have to understand about Pennsylvania is that the total vote count in Pennsylvania in 2020 was about 6.9 million total votes cast and 43.2 percent of them came from this county and these counties right here.
This isn't from some far-right news organization.
It's about using them effectively.
 How is Kamala Harris going to play in PA?
I think he was already the president for four years.
"I do a TV show that is called Front Porch Politics and it really focuses on the people, everyday people in communities, not candidates or institutions like congress and state legislatures."
 Welcome!
Like what's been happening in Florida?
Is Biden going to get the black turnout he got in Pittsburgh again?
"Welcome to Reporter's Notebook, where we talk to the Washington Examiner's top journalists about the stories breaking on their beats."
"And as someone who was cast as unappealing to young black men when I ran, I will tell you that I received strong support, identical to the African-American gentleman who was on the ticket with me, Raphael Warnock."
"Now the most recent New York Times, Siena poll shows Kamala Harris at 43% of the vote in the Northeast part of the state."
He has no charisma.
So those Republicans that don't love Trump.
What basically happened is both Politico and the Washington Post say they received what appeared to be an internal campaign document from an anonymous source who had emailed it.
"Which is strange, because Kamala is a person of color, and they tell us that that's super important."
Are you concerned about safety and security there today?
"I am a strong woman, a mom, a lawyer and an American."
He's not too happy.
So that's why you heard her taking aim at the former president for his comments there.
"Trump Questions Harris' Race in NABJ Interview On Wednesday, Trump's interview at the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago began with a controversial start when he falsely questioned Vice President Kamala Harris' race."

Pittsburgh passed the ban in 1992 after a rodeo bull broke its leg and had to be put down.
"Dave McCormick, perhaps, appeals more to suburban voters."
"By the way, The New York Times by some miracle found the race at the national level tied."

"And back in actually in October, it was like eight points here, seven or eight points."
Nothing could be better for race relations than that.
So make sure you stay with us.
"But essentially, it's drilling straight down."
So that was a huge surprise.
"However, several key states, including Pennsylvania, are leaning Republican."
And were you surprised at all that Governor Walz was tapped over your fellow Governor Josh Shapiro?

"If I ask you 50 times whether he lost the election, you would not acknowledge that he did."
He took questions from the crowd for about 90 minutes with South Carolina's Senator Kristi Noem serving as moderator.
"Charleroi, the town that Trump references in that clip, is a town in southwestern Pennsylvania."
"Among Hispanic voters, Donald Trump is seeing a rise among Latino men, while Hispanic women still support Kamala Harris in large numbers."
You said the poll to your point.
That number is very important.
"Again, if heels up doesn't win Pennsylvania, it's over."
"Governor constituents actually, they say selfishly that they're glad you didn't get it because they want you to stay here in Pennsylvania as their governor."
But I think there's a sense that we lived under Trump and it's not going to be any different than it was four years ago.
"It charged the entire political conversation in the country about whether relief should be sent to New Jersey, the scope of that relief."

"Just overall, because I don't like who's running against him."
What is this all about?

"Some of the more egregious things we've seen, Arizona."
"You know, we got these wonderful feel-good Olympics."

"Biden's success was largely driven by strong support in the suburbs of Philadelphia, as well as high turnout among African-American voters in urban areas like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia."

We have some very bad people.
The stock market is at an historic high.

"And you know, the other counties, that's where her challenge will be Erie County, North Hampton County, Cambria County."
"And so if you contrast that to what Donald Trump has opened up in PA, where I think it was just less than where you can count on one hand, where is all the money going in the Trump campaign?"
That's your first problem.
And I think you're also going to see her be able to play in the Philly burbs in a really meaningful way.
Women are going to play a big role in that.
Ain't nothing but Dick Cheney in a pantsuit.
"The next thing you want to know is, am I better off than I was four years ago?"
"Good morning, Earl."
"Trump, I do."
"And this would be a strong, strong, strong election performance because I have to be honest with you, too."
But Trump says it's a Nancy Pelosi insurrection here.
Can you get into that a little bit more?

"Over in Chicago, delegates are arriving for this week's Democratic National Convention."

And that went to prevent China from damaging the US auto industry.
Well I think that's a great way to kind of wrap things up and especially on where things are right now where things can be going direction in the future because of course in the event that Donald Trump is elected on November the 5th and over the 6th the 2028 campaign begins effectively.
"Well, the polling is very interesting indeed."
"Now, you know, we dealing with, we talking about the mainstream media being very bad."
Clock is ticking.
Now here's more on the top issues and how voters are feeling here in Erie County.
"While that's the same size lead he had over Biden in May, things have changed."
What did you think of the interview and why do you think Fox?
"So I had Ian on the show ask me, he's like, why would Donald Trump stand up after getting shot at?"
"You were sitting on the stage while President Obama was in Pittsburgh, and there was a point there where he talked about you and said, you ain't no show pony."
Like what I want it to look like.
Is that good enough?
White women making a lot of money are significantly higher in the heels up category than the other Trump category.
"And when you take a look at the numbers on 538, which is also quite accurate, you can see that where we are right now for the 2024 election in the general in Pennsylvania, Democrats do pull out the overall advantage ahead."
And I always research and substantiate everything I put out there.
That was the Vice President polling.
And not.
"For instance, in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, Trump has a slight lead."
She is following the Trump campaign for us So Olivia Trump is expected to focus on the economy at his event tonight in Nevada What types of policies is he proposing while on the campaign trail and and what can you tell us about them?

He's going to open the convention.
We've still got the vice presidential debate.

It certainly went down to 99 and I started freaking out already.
"I would rather be in Trump's position right now than Harris's, because if you're Trump, well, a point miss is kind of expected, especially with two big outliers like Quinnipiac, like Bloomberg, inflating Harris's margin."
We don't call each other names.
"Yeah, but they still- You took brace for a long election."
"Now is the final in 2022, roughly 68%."
"And these numbers, by the way, they're actually out of date a little bit."
The notion that the other side is worse than ours.
These are custom.
But Trump still has many pathways to winning.
Trump is doing a rally in Pennsylvania tonight.
The message is please be patient.
"I can't, we can't do this again and all that."
"But we'll have to see what happens on the Nevada front, on the Michigan front."

I think Biden's gonna come back and he's gonna retake the nomination of the DNC.
Or I just come home and eat it.
What happens on Election Day is the most important thing.
"I can understand, you know, oh, maybe it's a tight race in Pennsylvania and then Trump's tied in the popular vote."
Trump is in a heavily Republican area of a version of a part of that state.
"The Harris campaign's early ad reservations allow them to lock in lower rates, ensuring a robust media presence as the election approaches."
Duncan was forced to do this in order to support Harris.
"He shared which counties he thinks will decide this state, which he thinks will decide the nation."
"And Joel John, 45, voted for Trump in 2020, but feels he's no longer able to support the former president."
So you're going to tell me that every poll is a right wing poll now.
"We all here, we love our country."
"The legal victory serves as a testament to Trump's ability to navigate and influence legal and political processes, which can enhance his appeal to voters who value these qualities."
Let's get to 3 million subscribers together.
"The state's political landscape has undergone dramatic transformations over the past few election cycles, often mirroring broader national trends."
"Harris, 50 Trump 48 among likely voters."
But then RFK Jr.
"You know, they were going up against Trump's endorsement and there was no Democrat primary that was open on the governor's side."
"I mean, I'm looking at the political situation, they're like, what the fuck is going on at this point?"
Because so because there's like just days before the primary.
"Look, this is a state where the economy is usually the centerpiece of the argument in both presidential races and Senate races."
"He has become hyper focused on Pennsylvania, telling Pennsylvania's at the Butler rally that Harrison Walls will take away."
"Well, do you care more about the election now?"
"Back in March, this space became the new site of a field office for President Joe Biden's re-election bid, located in one of the counties he lost in 2020."
"This net zero approach has also increased farm costs exponentially, which I know comes as no surprise to anyone here today."
"In April, Muhlenberg College using an RV model had Trump leading President Biden 44-41."
How did he do?
D Vance will also be in South Philly that day.
"So the governor's office, the House and the state Senate, they protected abortion rights."
The race is on for both sides to define themselves and each other in what feels like a brand new race.
We win the whole.
Bring it.
"You tell a lie often enough, and it's not that people believe the lie, but they don't care about the truth anymore."
They might have Trump up again.
This video can watch in a playlist of my 2024 presidential election analysis videos.
And I think that will resonate with voters across the spectrum here in Pennsylvania.
There's a moment that a lot of people are talking about this morning where the former president just stood on stage for 30 minutes awkwardly while a greatest hits of his favorite songs played.
"So much to unpack, as they say from that."
"Well, from one end of the state to the other, KDK and our sister station CBS News Philadelphia are teaming up today to listen to you and take the pulse of Pennsylvania voters."
Today's visit is the start of a three day swing in the vital battleground state for President Biden.
She's now headed to Michigan today.
He drove to the private watch party that we had.
"They'll get the budget and go 10, 20, 30 times that, and the government just spends beyond that."
"And I do think this debate, just remember the last debate with President Biden, that changed everything."
Do they have the money to repair their homes?
"Hey there, Jesse."
"Based shit, man."
"And so for anybody who's like, oh, no, no, no, Kamala Harris is going to win these swing states."
This campaign for us is really born out of love of country.
And I think the third thing is she has to show herself as a moderator who can appeal to centrists.
"Conversely, failing to secure this vital state could raise serious questions about the party's ability to connect with diverse electorates, particularly in battleground states where economic, social, and cultural issues intersect."
But the thing is I Think as we all know here it You know the polling aggregate does slightly favor Trump in Trump has unique point of strength here Cuz let's go to something like the 2000 election and you can see Gore was up for right 2004 Kerry was up two and a half 2008 Obama won by over 10 2012 by 5 so Trump's connection to the state with his economic policies Really is what drove him to victory a very narrow one against Hillary Clinton and even a loss that was still the most narrow in This century against Biden back in 2020.
And I know it's your shirt here.
And McCormick too.
Another factor to consider is the enthusiasm gap.
"And just for the sake of disclosure, we're talking about a poll here, specifically in Pennsylvania, a sample size of a bit more than 1,300 people, a margin of error, 2.7 percentage points, smaller than the rest."
These are really good numbers coming out and we will see if that does end up holding.
They're escalating a horrible war scenario.
"The fourteenth and final poll of 1,649 likely voters was conducted by the New York Times Siena College between October 12 and 14."
"I mean, there was a new AP poll today that shows him with a seven percentage point advantage, 45 percent to 38 percent over Harris about who can better handle the economy."
Now that Kamala Harris is building out this advantage and expanding her lead.
Right now they have Trump winning.
"If we can offload as the insurance company, the offload people aged 55 to 65 onto the government, onto Medicare, our risk pool now has improved so we could charge the same amount of money."
Is it possible that she takes it maybe in reverse?
Because do people just forget 2020?
I'm not proud to say that either.
"You don't explain a consistent trend of Republicans out-registered Democrats 2 to 1, 3 to 1."
"In the last 50, 60 years, and now that Kissinger is dead, he's the worst, this is saying that it was equating with Darth Vader."
"You know, it's emotionally draining, right?"
"This is, you know, what America was built off was free enterprise, free marketing to where you could own your own business, make money, no, without having a corporation with that, you know, you could go out on the street and just make your money."
Was the older number.
Let's play it and get your reaction.
He is someone who will stop at nothing to claim power for himself.
Shout out to Philadelphia.
That's what we have here.
I think you're going to see probably Atlas Intel drop another poll and Trafalgar and they're all going to show broadly the same kind of thing as me.
"I want the American people first help for small businesses, you know?"
It looks really different from James' big wins in 92 with Bill Clinton in the sense that Philly is critically important.
"But I do think if we didn't have the pandemic, there would be no none of this crazy mail in voting that's now like a staple."
"And Pennsylvania, by the way, we're the second largest natural gas producing state in the nation."
"Oh, it's disoriented."
What is up people of the internet?
We've seen Trump do really well in Pennsylvania.
"Recent polls showed Trump and Harris are neck and neck in the seven swing states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina."
"But you know, like welcome other people's ideas."
This is near Cardi's summer home on Maryland's Eastern shore.
Because it's not just about not agreeing on where we should move as a country.
"Oh, I mean, I would just say hey Joe It's said it's a no we can't let's say yes, we can My values have not changed now she wants to do Transgender operations or an illegal aliens that are in prison."
He technically did better than Biden and Haley combined in the state.
Pennsylvania in particular will be under the microscope as results start to come in.
Trump doesn't have a message.
Is that right?
You should see the ads on our television station.
"As of today, the Democrats are short like 15 percent in their vote by mail totals, comparing with 2020."
"Regardless of your location, you can conveniently receive 6Do brief via email."
"With just 35 days left until the 2024 US presidential election, the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is heating up, especially in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state."
And a tremendous amount of undecided and independent voters swinging in Kamala Harris's direction.
Even this vote was even the Vice President she polled for.
"Look at what the end, especially it's fascinating that a lot of these polls are coming out of the New York Times again, because on October 18, 2016, the New York Times reported that Hillary Clinton had a 91 percent chance of winning against Trump."
"No, it doesn't."
It's his hometown.
"Over the weekend, there was another scare near a Trump rally, this time in California."
Do you think that she can move the needle enough to make that marginal difference to win?
Big margins in the suburbs that surround Philadelphia are critical for Democrats.
"Trump's base continues to rally around his messages on the economy, particularly his approach to job creation and business regulation."
Move.
"Putin saw that, invaded Ukraine."
And I cannot impress upon people enough that this is somebody Donald Trump who intends to take us backward and saying this about earning votes from black Americans.
"And so they also found that amongst voter demographics, Kamala Harris performed better than Biden did with key Democratic coalitions, doing better amongst black voters in these swing states and younger voters, and also gaining ground with older voters that can explain why Kamala Harris is ahead by four points when Biden only won Wisconsin by one, or Pennsylvania by one, or Michigan by three."
 Are Democrats right to be nervous about Pennsylvania?
"Vice President Kamala Harris is saying, listen to the former president's words, let them speak for himself."
Harris is more positive.
"Nationally, I think his ceiling is probably 46% this time around with all the third party candidates."
But do I think you could see Trump win the state by like two to three?
"A lot of analysts are saying she needs to hold that blue wall in the north, which includes us, Michigan, Wisconsin, some of these these rust belt blue collar states."
"In contrast, Trump's campaign has only reserved ad time in Pennsylvania and Georgia."
"And of course, Trump is trying to take her back to her days in California when she was anti-Trump fracking."
"And no, well, you got a, you got a, it's a national alumni club, Trey Turner and, uh, and, and, and Swarber."
"Not perfect, but quite accurate in a way that many other national pollsters have really missed the mark."
"Look, I'm from western Pennsylvania."
"As you could see what you see in the speeches of the leaders who are trading barbs at each other, making personal attacks, calling each other dangerous, the enemy within, calling them rabid, Donald Trump calling Kamala Harris rabid leftist, using that kind of language, threatening to deploy national guard, which is an empty threat though, because he's not the United States president."
"And so take a look at how he decided to essentially go off message, go off that strategy and instead attack Kamala Harris."
The only similarity between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris' appearances in Pennsylvania yesterday was that they went after each other.
"She will continue, allow it to continue."
It was his first event in the Keystone State since the assassination attempt on July 13.
"First off we have starting here, does Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirms Cornel West will not appear on state ballots?"
"The other day I saw her get up and say we will do this, we will do that, we're gonna, why didn't they do it four years ago?"
"Tell us about the impact domestically and those jobs shifting elsewhere, other countries."
Pennsylvania is poised to be one of the most critical battleground states this cycle.
So I think she's going to do well.
"I think it can look, unfortunately, like what it looked like in 2020 with violence in our communities, with threats to public officials, good public officials like Al Schmidt and the Republican and Democratic clerks of elections."
That's been huge.
"So today we'll be looking at a 0.5 victory for Kamala Harris where it's currently at right now, despite a huge win for Donald Trump."
Now let's take a look at some of the headlines I came across when I went through about a dozen new sites across central Pennsylvania this morning.
"If MSNBC reported more like CNN, and this is not an endorsement of the fairness of CNN, although I will tell you I do not over and over again see CNN hosts banging away at Trump's dictator with spittle flying from their mouths the same way I do on MSNBC."
You can't even take long trips with this.
And so you will find that this Democratic sponsored poll probably is misleading in the sense that Kamala Harris is probably not up four points in Pennsylvania.
"It is my humble pleasure to introduce our amazing Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris."
That's more than the forty four thousand votes that Trump won in 2016.
Pennsylvania looks tougher.
I think there is a danger that they tune the president out.
So what it comes down to is turnout.
We're about 75% there.
"He caught some heat the other day, you know, and so he comes out with this statement that all of a sudden he's a believer in IVF."
She had the ability to reshape the way that Americans viewed her.
So do you have anything to add to the people that you want to let them know about anything at all?
"Yeah, I don't know what the data is to to back that up."
There were four pillars.
Previously it appeared that the race post debate had frozen in place with neither candidate with any clear momentum.
And we just saw the two candidates for Senate there face off Senator Bob Casey and businessman Dave McCormick had a spirited debate tonight in Pennsylvania is also where Donald Trump and Kamala Harris spent much of the day on Monday.
Good evening everyone.
The headline on one of his recent sub stack blog posts.
Gary Johnson.
There were solicitation charges related to that false elector scheme as part of the alleged election interference case.
"You've been eaten alive with inflation and all I'm doing is getting you back to even Harris tonight focused on the economy too in Western Pennsylvania, making the case that her policies will help middle America and trying to reach out to black voters, stopping at a black owned business in Erie today."
"And that is a really good point, because I remember that from the last election."
And it's interesting that President Biden now has been trying to tie the Republican Party writ large to what he terms the MAGA movement.
"To this day, I still don't really get it, how anybody voted for him back in 2022."
"Multiple sources close to the campaign tell NBC News that Harris's running mate will make their debut at a rally in Philadelphia tomorrow, and that the announcement most likely will come in a text that's sent to high-ranking Democrats, which is the same way they did it when President Biden picked Harris."
"There's a ton of them in Western PA. That's a fact and it's a possibility that these new Republicans, these are just Democrats that have been voting Republican anyways, so it's not really a game for them."
"Uh, I think it's a Specified case where it should be in use."
"It's going to be the, this is the best Trump is polling by far."
"And my favorite is the Trump iconic black mug, where you get the Trump iconic bullet American flag design on the front."
President Obama's appearance on the campaign trail showing support for Kamala Harris comes at a crucial time.
Please roll the clip.
"I mean, remember, this is only a weeks-old campaign."
"So please, if you don't like Donald Trump, totally get it."
I wouldn't go there no matter what.
"So again, these like these 10,000 ballots that could have been soiled, they can, you know, decide the election."
"And like I said, it's pollsters like Mollenburg pollsters like the Washington Post, even Marist."
Can Harris secure Pennsylvania and push herself past the finish line in this nail-biting election?
They accused Washington County of violating the constitutional due process rights of voters by deliberately concealing whether their ballot had been counted.
No question about it.
Decide the poll of the revisionist history of his years.
I'm here to solve problems.
32% were under the age of 45.
"And even just at late this afternoon, District Attorney Fadi Willis filed to get the charges against former President Trump restated in the 2020 election interference case, you may recall earlier this spring, a series of charges, about six charges were thrown out against the former president and five of his co-defendants."
"On the other hand, the Democratic Party may face increased pressure to address concerns about election security and to articulate their position on these issues more clearly."
"So on election night, what counties will you Dr."
"I do what I want, and I'm not responsible for anything."
When was the last time?
"Even if they aren't voting for the ticket, Tim Walz is relatively popular."
I think the last time we pulled there was like Trump was up by like 4.4% and I think the margin of error was like somewhere down like 3% or something.
"Yes, it's a meme."
And the article kind of hints at some deeper issues within the campaign.
"Corey's wife said, I'd rather have my husband."
It's very very close.
The sense of unity and shared purpose was evident in every face.
"And if I were the Democrats, I would be very worried that their voter registration numbers continue to decrease even after the so-called Taylor Swift endorsement."
"You've had four years, Pennsylvania."
"No, man."
This equals very small profit margins and therefore we have been purchasing a fraction of the feeder cattle that we have the capacity to feed.
Portrait right there.
So he comes to you from the common sense perspective and then he comes to you from the business perspective and real people can recognize that we see what's going on.
"Because again, whether you look at our polls or others, you know, we could run the same poll and show Harris maybe even or plus one."
Let's just go back to this map.
Like what?
"I mean, look, we've seen an increase in registrations."
I'm not with her.
"But but to that point, JD Vance is unpopular, so he doesn't provide a balance to Donald Trump."
"Blood donors of all types, especially those with typo blood, are urged to give as soon as possible."
"Now, when we look at Pennsylvania as a whole, we talk about two different regions, but these two regions aren't necessarily that important."
"And, you know, it's just, we work hard to make, make a dollar and the dollar isn't even the dollar nowadays."
"Let's all pray for the Trump family, and I will be back on later with more updates."
They need to get their head examined.
How's it?
And you talk about the margin of error.
"So that's what I've seen from the ads and I think that's something the left does really well and that's something the right, the Republican, we really have to work on is that emotional appeal of like, okay, this really matters and this is why."
"And Jay, Harris is getting some good polling this morning in the Sunbelt states."
"Here in Lancaster County, Biden lost by double digits, so his team is not expecting to flip this area blue, but they do hope he can lose by less here this time around to help his bottom line."
"And I'm like, so is it not honorable for Donald Trump to stand up after someone trying to take his life, raise his fist and let all of his supporters know that he is leading the charge?"
You take that income out.
"We'll go to Muhlenberger first, because it's got a 6% margin of error, 450 votes here."
"Lindsay Davis, our good friend from New Jersey."
"Yeah, thank you so much."
CBS News campaign reporter Aaron Navarro is joining us now with more on the Harris team's movements.
"And in the White House, she will have an outstanding partner in Governor Tim Walz."
And that is what I want to see in a President of the United States of America.
"She first off, she doesn't seem to be part of the establishment."
That's just the way the polling is.
"And what there's no evidence that that one attack or that one, even a conviction is going to be the thing that breaks the camel's back."
"Because Philly is make or break for Democrats in Pennsylvania, right?"
He's not being transparent with the voters.
Biden barely won Pennsylvania.
"So it looked, if it turns out that it's less than 90% of black women voted for Kamala, then you know, it's real."
"Aaron, tight numbers going into the debate tomorrow."
"Well, Major, it's certainly not something that they are sharing explicitly with us, but sources say that they are well aware that that has started to follow up among key groups."
"No improvement in Texas, no improvement in Florida, no improvement in Ohio, no improvement in many of these other states."
"Either you're going to be over there, over there."
Does he actually believe it?
"Donald Trump won Pennsylvania by 40,000 votes."
He's selling God bless the USA Bibles made in China.
Everybody tune in because it's time to address something.
"And the fact of the matter is 157,000 Republicans on the primary election, even after Nikki Haley had withdrawn, voted for her."
Donald Trump then wants the crowd to know he is not cognitively impaired.
"Pennsylvania has a special issue, and it's the fracking issue."
"And it's interesting, Akayla, in our NBC News poll, voters were asked, what is the one issue you feel so strongly about that you will vote for or against a candidate solely on that issue?"
He never folds them.
"And I can say just covering the rallies since that assassination attempt, most of them have been held indoors to make sure they are secure."
"Okay, great."
"Just remember, endorsing incumbents and Republican nominees in red districts is not a difficult way to run up your score for endorsements when you have actual tough races where the primary winner might actually affect who wins."
"And if he does that, he's got a sizable advantage in the state of Pennsylvania."
"Really what's important is somebody that can articulate their ideas, listen, respond well."
So this is a county that both campaigns are fighting to win.
Robert I know we started off the evening where you said you're not sure who you may support.
"Assuming whites are gonna vote, you just can't make that assumption."
"The sixth poll was conducted between September 20 and 24 by Beacon Research, Shaw and Company Research among 775 likely voters."
Third state up for grabs Quinnipiac university poll finds Pennsylvania Harris 51 Trump 45.
"But before we reveal the numbers, make sure to hit that subscribe button for instant updates on all things election related."
How do you feel the way Snippy Joe is handling himself as president?
"Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will take their bus tour through central Pennsylvania this week, making multiple stops across the state."
"Well, I'll return back to I'll just make the point is Senator Casey said I was his first boss when he worked on his dad's campaign."
Will you just give a thumbs up or type Y if you can hear me?
"We're tired of the perpetual war I'm more legal immigrants Tired tired of the immigrants tired of those prices, but I need them then don't go down now You guys are younger gentlemen, is that the biggest issue that you guys are facing guys kind of Gen Z voters here?"
"She was so filthy dirty, disgusting."
"And I said, Ian, let me ask you something."
That's just crazy.
And now continues doing so.
"Haha, that was a great one buddy."
Now would be Adam Kinzinger.
I'm not weird.
"So the state of Pennsylvania, we talk about how important Pennsylvania is to Donald Trump's chances in the 2024 presidential election all the time because this is a state that is the largest swing state, you know, Florida and Texas, those states are not really going to be all that competitive."
We can cut the check for Ukraine.
"Trump's anti-immigrant message and recent lies that legal Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating cats and dogs, has only made these Republicans question their party more."
"15,000 people."
"It is, 100%."
She was making this extremely bold promise that she was going to take the US oil industry possibly criminally prosecute them for their role in climate change.
And this poll resulted in an exact tie.
They're starting their careers and their dollars are not going as far.
"And folks in particularly communities like mine in the Mon Valley region of Allegheny County, those big steel country have seen jobs leave and they know how that devastates a community."
I know what it requires and you're going to be outstanding.
Let me tell you something.
"Look, I think it's a it's a valid concern."
We saw a lot of people doing absentee ballots.
"Yeah, Lindsay, we know that he was arrested on the perimeter of the rally."
A one point swing in Wisconsin and Michigan means Trump is president of the United States.
"I mean, this is the challenge, right?"
You're here!
See the problem is in Washington everybody's looking out for their jobs So everybody in power in the administration other than Joe Biden is still in They're all still fighting for their jobs So that administration is going to leverage all of its executive power To try to prevent anybody else from interrupting Because their jobs are on the line Not just Kamala Harris but everybody in the Biden administration that she might replace Or that anyone might replace Right so Gretchen Whitmer comes along He says no I want my own staff I want my own XYZ of course the cabinet We don't know what would Kamala Harris change Biden's cabinet We don't know Would Gretchen Whitmer with any of them or would they say hey we're going to continue on with this administration regardless of whom you choose to be president I mean if that's the case it's all about identity politics If it's not about agenda what else is it about And the Democrats better come up with an agenda quick Because nobody knows what the hell they're trying to do Nobody knows what they want to do Nobody what you tell me folks what do the Democrats want to do?
"Let that sink in and don't be a damn bit afraid of saying it, because that's exactly who he is."
He's confused.
What are you hoping to hear from Trump in Tuesday's debate?
The Cash App link is in the description.
"We can have our partisan choices for candidates, but the running of elections is something that really needs to be nonpartisan."
"Yeah, essentially if Biden loses Pennsylvania, the only way he could realistically even have a shot at the White House is he'd need to flip North Carolina."
"And and so no, that was the long answer to your question."
"Harris went another way in her VP search, but the selection process solidified Shapiro's status as a star."
"Man, what come to gas then?"
Very interesting.
I might have another.
"Lone Star State is an emerging battleground as Joe Biden received 46.5% of votes in the 2020 election, the highest vote share for a Democrat since Texas last went blue in 1976."
Some black men took pot shots at Barack Obama.
 It's about to be a very busy Labor Day for Democrats who are courting union voters in battleground states.
"Oh, Tony is incredible."
"But I'm pretty sure that if Kamala Harris gets elected, we will become a communist country."
Can we get a photo really quick?
"I got to tell you, I've heard voters for Trump."
I shared this with our vice president during her 2022 visit and it was so great hearing the passion and concern in her voice speaking on how diligently she and the administration is working to make sure that all households achieve the goal of having access to clean drinking water and lead-free paint.
"He really needs to rally the troops there, which is why he's spending so much time there, acting like a populist, talking about Donald Trump, how Donald Trump wants to please only the wealthy."
The effect that's having on the electorate is that it's polarizing people.
"And when it comes to immigration and the border, what is some of the polling revealing about the tightness in Arizona and other border states?"
"We can take Baltimore and with people like Kim Klasek, we will take Baltimore."
"And in part, they see an opening to define Harris."
The third poll was conducted between September 14th and 15 by Insider Advantage among 800 likely voters.
You think she's heard this advice?
"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president."
This is not good.
Let's move on to the next topic.
"So, critical state, critical district here, critical county, because Luzerne County is really a toss-up here."
This is really the first time in a while he's been meaningfully leaning in Pennsylvania.
I was very impressed by her energy and how much she's kind of grown as a candidate.
"It really I think further diminished At least print political journalism and we were writing about what was going on on TV all the time but that really that rose was really the beginning of the change and With the internet came the explosion of media sites that everybody could start to really Good silo themselves with sites that perhaps spoke to their own political preconceptions and so the old Gatekeepers which was New York Times Washington Post maybe Wall Street Journal somewhat the LA Times ABC NBC CBS those were the main gatekeepers Well, their impact started to really diminish and that fragmentation has accelerated ever since to where we are today What what Kamala Harris has done this week was a perfect example of what I'm talking about that the mainstream outlets They all want interviews whether you know, which basically it's like, you know, we're the professional journalists We know the most about issues."
Donald Trump putting in the work also in Pennsylvania.
And really what it's going to come down to in my opinion is character.
That's huge.
"Trump's campaign is also heavily focused on Pennsylvania, criticizing Harris on economic issues and trying to shape her image among voters."
It might be something different.
What's past his prologue?
High school.
So Harris weighted down by this.
"So the fact that Trump is polling above Biden in Pennsylvania, when Biden's the incumbent, you'd have to say is a good sign."
"Yes, Politico, not Fox News, not Newsmax."
"I think nuclear politics, as we've seen, based on social media, based on who runs it, is that they do very much have partisan beliefs."
"It is me, Real American, back in with a new video."
We're exhausted after this but I think it's going to be a little more smooth sailing that we have a better idea of how to drive the test.
I do not take any – people were dying.
And the good news is that you have a candidate.
"Like we just talked about what's going on with the Haitian Americans right now because you know Trump is outwardly sort of antagonizing that group right of people and with spreading lies about you know What's going on with like Haitians in Springfield, Ohio or whatever?"
It can go either way.
"You know, you could have these intentions and then when you get into the presidency, you don't have the ideological foundations or rudder that can make you address questions that come to your desk and personnel decisions."
"But if he's up by two to three points as of now, which by the way, this should be Harris's best polling right now, especially in August."
One last question.
Enthusiastic or not.
He could go out west and win Arizona.
I'm John Zink.
So that's what happened there.
So these kinds of polls look really good.
It's going to take a lot more than just one person to turn things around.
Will this Trump campaign?
Um now Shout out to brendan.
Give me one reason you believe that.
I do not know what that means.
That's a Harris point three.
I wish there were more diverse candidates.
"You know, folks that you come off as very scripted."
Why would we not accept the results?
We don't have any active wells on our farm but I know that we get residuals from you know mining underneath like the gas being extracted that way.
We're just alienating ourselves against Russia even more and escalating tensions.
The same thing goes for Wisconsin.
"They say to me in my show, why would he stand up after getting shot at?"
"Welcome back, everyone."
You know that she's never said frack in her life just a short while ago when she realized her poll numbers were dying in Pennsylvania.
"I mean, we she helped write the Green New Deal, which is anti energy, anti fracking, anti energy."
"He told News Nation's Chris Cuomo that Harris lacks the ability to effectively articulate her policies and engage in unscripted debates, key qualities he believes are essential for the presidency."
"So my point being, in the unedited portion, she makes a claim about how the administration has handled Israel that I do not think is true."
And I don't see a shift in that this election.
Disappointed.
And in fact it stayed that way and voted blue for every single presidential election all the way through the Bush years.
"His candidate for Vice President, J.D."
And here he is randomly talking about Hannibal Lecter again.
You see Trump going in with an earring?
"About 55% say legal, 40% say illegal."
"One line from the memo that really stuck with me was she said, quote, please give us the tools to win for as we all know, you do not win P.A."
"Not engaged, not participating."
But good news coming out of Pennsylvania.
And that's what you're going to continue to see.
And it seems odd that like there hasn't been much credit for that assigned to her.
"Since yesterday, a lot of things have come to light."
"We're talking about Pennsylvania, the voter registration, everything."
"She's smart She's effective She's white And unfortunately, we ain't got time to play race card games with the fucking cbc part of my language But we ain't got time We don't cbc is ridiculous All this cape and you know why because She's one eighth black, but she's Flubby you know what?"
"If Republicans win either Michigan or Pennsylvania, then the night's over."
"And so after all these years, we know who Donald Trump is."
I don't know that you could really argue that Donald Trump is.
And thanks for watching.
They will literally do anything like a few stage.
We get laughed at a lot for some of the shenanigans that our government does.
"You know, you want to be heard."
You've said there's a huge amount of people in the middle that can be influenced by the extremes.
How does Pennsylvania stand up today?
"Yeah I mean it's what we've been saying now for quite some time that this comes down to Blue Wall, Blue Wall, Blue Wall."
"Now, look at Haley's numbers in Bucks County, outside Philadelphia, 19 percent better than her statewide Montgomery County, almost a quarter of the vote."
The other polls were Clifton plus nine Joe by seven.
"So poorly she was behind Pete, booty gig, Amy Klobuchar, all these randos on a democratic side."
"If it wasn't for a single poll that had Harris up by five points when literally everyone, and I mean everyone else, found the race either tied or a very small Trump lead."
All of that is true.
"All types of America doesn't have a gun problem, it has a black problem."
"I knew immediately that something was wrong when I heard the whizzing around, the whizzing sounds, shots and immediately felt bullet ripped through the skin."
Several minutes.
"Beautiful town of Asheville, North Carolina."
"Donald Trump is at 50% in the battleground states, Harris is at 48%."
The next Biden versus Trump rematch.
He's in a significantly stronger position and I'm not anticipating a six-point polling error again in Wisconsin.
This rally is happening about a month before election day.
I've had residents come when we first pushed the first ceasefire resolution for what's unfolding across Gaza to speak to the calamity that has struck their family.
We have seven point miss in Pennsylvania.
"If Republicans win in 2024 but not in 2028, will Vance certify the election?"
"And for Roe v. Wade, what's the law?"
Is that correct?
"However, in another Beacon research poll from the same dates, Harris takes back the lead, securing 48% while Trump sits at 46%."
"But nonetheless, you are seeing Trump, this is very healthy."
I think a lot more attention needs to be focused on how to make it easy and attractive to do the right thing.
And let me be really clear.
That's a this year.
"In some states, it looked like Biden was winning, like in Florida, because they were counting the absentee votes as they came in."
Are you still voting and rooting for Trump and praying for Trump?
We know that it's going to likely be make or break.
This is fascist.
Or how about 58 would be.
"And I'm not saying this for sure going to happen, but there's a chance that Republicans are 30% of the returns while Democrats are not even 60%."
"And just remember that after this election, there will still be plenty of Republicans in the House and the Senate."
"If I'm quoting something, if I get a statement from someone, say I'm writing about whatever I'm writing about."
But I think the largest voting bloc are those who are not considering coming out to vote at all.
"I don't know how to tell you this, man."
So he is an absolute hot mess right now.
But those aren't the people I'm talking about today.
He said he grew up with nothing.
"We see a New Jersey and New York, the Mid-Atlantic as a whole, even Virginia is not doing so hot."
"But look, I think people are getting it when you actually speak with voters, especially independent voters and most Americans of about 42 43% of Americans identify as independent voters and they see Donald Trump talking about killing the border bill."
I've seen you been faced a lot of opposition.
"Furthermore, the historical voting patterns of Pennsylvania complicate Harris's path to victory even further."
"We don't want them to find any ballots at 4 o'clock in the morning and add them to the list, OK?"
This is completely different.
"Anyways, do we all realize how serious of a situation that was?"
She says not voting is not an option in a state that could decide the 47th president.
They rush into the store and they walk out with television sets.
They're some of the highest paying tax brackets in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
"I feel like maybe if they lower the job age, they might have better job rates."
"Ohio just voted all different, by the way."
But you're feeling good.
Something like four and a half out of the seven days that week she's returning.
There's enough electoral map math there that makes it so that these states could truly be the ones that hand Kamala Harris the presidency.
"The winner gets called by like 11 o'clock, 1130 at night."
That was his lead in May.
"He said just just the other day, we actually lost it by a whisker."
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 47% each.
"And again, for the fourth week in a row, Donald Trump is beating Kamala Harris by two points, 49 percent to 47 percent."
"I mean, that is that is the number one thing that she needs to penetrate between now and election day is really selling herself as I'm a good person and I can handle the economy."
Why does Hannity support unprincipled Donald Trump?
It was won in the past by President Clinton.
They're ridiculous.
You got into a car accident.
You're golden.
And this is something that they feel they are very strong with going forward.
"No, these are new voters."
"Like, why would they report this?"
Let me repeat that.
JD has been great.
I have friends.
So we can see that it's likely almost guaranteed that he's going to try to steal the election again.
Donald Trump is still in the lead in all those swing states.
"So he's effectively been able to figure out a way to work with, you know, a very diverse Democratic Party in Minnesota that obviously has some aligned interests, but also has its differences."
"A decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is therefore seen as a significant endorsement of these views, and it could bolster the campaign's efforts to promote similar measures in other key battleground states."
And a brand new formula that drives those dollars out to the districts that need it most.
And I didn't deal like that.
Good for a fair time this time of year.
And the good news is that you have candidates to vote for in this election that demonstrate that kind of character who know what real strength looks like who will set a good example and do the right thing and leave this country better than they found it.
"Erin McClelland, a candidate for treasurer, endorsed North Carolina Gov."
"We try to stay on topic with things, but then things devolved and Casey attacked McCormick for his hedge fund and McCormick attacked Casey for trying to boss him around about the military because he is a veteran."
" Kamala Harris is in Pennsylvania tonight, which may very well be the most important tipping point state in this year's election."
"A retired school teacher, she's centered on family and her faith."
And the clock is ticking.
He's not going to be appearing with Vice President Harris.
Did you have anything else to add?
This is saying that it shot someone in the face on a hunting trip and the guy he shot in the face apologized to him.
She should have that off the top of her head and she refused to answer it because she refuses to take responsibility for the unprecedented crisis that we have at our southern border.
Former president Clinton is in Georgia now rallying rural black voters for Harris.
"I'm sure you guys are feeling it, too."
"And for those that don't know, Franklin and Marshall is a trash pollster."
"Yeah, I mean, she didn't really answer the question."
And I never agreed with our approach talking about that he's a convicted felon.
And what does he tell you as well?
But don't take my opinion for it.
"And I say, yeah, yeah, it was good, because it was my economy that I gave to him."
Don't just attack somebody for telling you.
"If he loses Pennsylvania, he basically has to win Pennsylvania in order to come up with the victory here."
"And then she says, I grew up in a middle class family."
That's why it's not good for Democrats that they're way behind where they should be.
Both candidates received an equal number of votes in this poll.
This is ridiculous even by their own aggregates.
"They both lean Democratic, but really close margins here, and every vote is going to count."
African-American.
You can't win in Arizona by that much in a competitive race anymore.
So imagine it coming from a guy who wants to be given unchecked power.
"Of course, come on."
"In 10 seconds, Trump was put on the floor by Secret Service and they protected him from the shooter."
"It does tilt her way here though on our latest polling map, joining Wisconsin, which does lift Kamala Harris up to 244 electoral votes now as Trump continues to lag behind at 228."
They can't you can't kill a baby after it's born.
"She was consistently minus 14, minus 15 in terms of approval."
They're regulating us into oblivion.
"People are generally not super satisfied with what they're seeing from their leaders and candidates, but that is how the cards have been playing."
"The only one who comes out ahead in this was Pennsylvania Governor, Josh Shapiro, who has a 47 percent approval rating."
"She's been our nominee now only for a few weeks, so of course you've got some campaigning to do."
"So like I said, Dr. Oz and McCormick both are awful."
"Use it, please."
"No doubt this is a difficult, frightening moment for everyone who was there, everyone across the country who was watching for there to be shots to have been fired toward the president."
There's a coordinated attack.
"Trump at 54%, Nikki Haley at 46%, whereas President Biden in Delaware County at 97%, to Dean Phillips at 3%."
"I brought them into my ceremonial office at the White House to have a meeting about what their needs are and to make sure that they have the information about what's available to them in terms of financing capital and access to capital, support for what they want to do in terms of building or growing their business."
You may change your mind having that affiliation on your official documents means nothing.
Democrats had roughly 1.1 million.
And so who got a whole lot of money being spent against Bob Casey.
This source points out a bunch of other polls showing similar trends.
We could siphon off thousands or tens of thousands of additional votes easily probably hundreds of thousands if people were to do the early voting thing.
"If you're getting squeezed by prescription drug prices, Kamala Harris is going to take on Big Pharma."
So she changed her position on fracking.
"It's going neck and neck, like you're saying, for the time being."
"Devastating, because that isn't communism."
And we'll see how things shake out.
We know that she wrote a memoir so we know that she lived in Virginia for a very long time perhaps pretty until recently.
But how would you how would you suggest that they talk to voters about that?
Vance did in Ohio this past Tuesday.
 Hello everybody and welcome back to Red Eagle politics.
He is completely out of step with the values and views of Pennsylvanians.
"And from what I hear, there was weird, weird coincidences."
"Either way, Donald Trump looks really, really good right now, especially in Pennsylvania with that new poll."
"Pennsylvania has a Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, who enjoys widespread popularity."
"I don't think no, it hasn't."
And it just goes to show you.
I think they had Biden winning Ohio.
"We got, we need him."
"And if you put all that together, it's a harder sell to say you're now going to just turn around on all these issues when very recently you had a completely different viewpoint on them."
And Laura is here with us in studio alongside Lisa Desjardins.
I'm a she her woman everything.
It couldn't be more night and day.
"Back in August of 2020, Biden was winning Pennsylvania by six and a half points."
Bush onto his ticket.
All four of these lifelong Republicans voted for Nikki Haley for president in the Arizona Republican primary.

But he also did a town hall that was centered around women's issues more specifically where he addressed an all female audience.
"Now seeing this from a better angle, it's clear claims Biden is angry about being pushed out or true."
Tim's a veteran.
"Raymond, pleasure to meet you."
There's a policy not for him as a candidate.
And Stahl correctly points out it wasn't a guarantee.
That's helpful with establishing your credentials as a public speaker and a policy leader.
It's about values.
"Instead, he emphasized the importance of a unity party, allowing for continued disagreements on various issues."
It voted for a Democrat president for generations.
"These efforts, according to his thesis, have resulted in a noticeable improvement in the lives of individuals, and they stand in stark contrast to what he referred to as rhetoric without results on the side of the Republican Party that he was referring to."
You got to show up and vote.
"The last time an attempt at a U.S. president's life was actually successful was 1963, John F. Kennedy."
This is me forever and ever.
I appreciate that.
"I mean, I can tell you when I talk to Republican leaders in Congress and in the Senate specifically, they weren't talking about Pennsylvania earlier this year as one of those places that they thought they were most likely to flip."
But black people are not the ones who are behind this.
Now it's basically tied Harris with a small margin there.
I think maybe she should be partaking in lithium because Donald Trump should be forced to live on an island with all these people.
"In the case of McCormick versus versus Oz, it almost certainly did."
"Again, I'm not denying that she is doing better than Biden because well, Biden was just doing so bad that people were begging for something else."
It's like a thing on the left is funny.
CNN said that's extremely different.
"She was one of the, I think she's like the most unlike VP and history in terms of approval writing."
"You know, hurricane season isn't over yet."
And so it's hard to know whether this is just rhetoric and play or whether it really counts for something.
"You have to make sure you get out in these counties, because we know this election is going to be close."
Do not vote.
"I'm going to zoom in here on the Philadelphia suburbs, Bob, and as you know, as well as anybody, these are the places that we all watch to see which way Pennsylvania is going to go because they're going to be pivotal."
"Well, you know, fracking is the entire reason the United States led the world in reducing our CO2 emissions after 2010 to about 2020."
On the screen is a video you can watch and then a playlist for my 2024 presidential election analysis videos.
"It's always a nail-biter, right?"
"It became more clear than ever, I believe after that Fox News interview that President Trump needs to be reelected."
Now the Harris campaign provided a list of Politico of several examples of surrogate events aimed at engaging voters of color.
So I think that was not true.
It's happened many times in history They just failed when lawfare doesn't work.
"But nonetheless, it looks like Pennsylvania is just absolutely dead, dead heat."
"The next poll, also conducted by morning consult from September 19 to 25 with 920 for likely voters, gives Harris a six-point advantage, polling at 51% compared to Trump's 45%."
You dare face me.
Martinez sees Harris as a leader who understands the complexities of the healthcare system and is committed to making it more inclusive.
"Moving to the fourth poll from August 6th to 8th, conducted by Trafalgar Group, with 1,078 likely voters, Harris received 44% of the vote, while Trump received 46%."
And I'm not particularly shy about what I hear.
Joan London is an attorney for local governments.
"You know, we're going to get in 2024."
Now let's continue.
Guy the red rub was talking about how you know white people are so quiet at this point because it was a white person who shot at him.
He won't back down and coming back here is very similar.
"But either way, what's more likely these undecided voters to break for Trump or break for Harris?"
Here is what I am doing.
"He held a town hall meeting where he just, let me explain, because I've done a lot of town hall meetings."
So I guess this is the Kamala that we've got.
"Now for you liberals out there, I'll explain this to you because you're morons."
Not only do these voters dismiss Trump's many legal challenges.
You've got to convince a prosecutor in a court.
And 23-year-old Kevin Winkler is a retired pastor who voted for Donald Trump in 2016.
I don't think it would matter.
I don't believe it.
I haven't asked a question yet.
"I think to Daniel's point earlier, people they're excited."
"So here in Pennsylvania, I say to those who know best when freedom is on the line, Americans always answer the call."
"Helping her survive is John Cena, a freelance lottery protection agent."
And I appreciate you all coming out the day before homecoming.
They make tremendous profit.
Nobody cares.
You have a lot of pollsters in here that are not these right-leaning polls.
This is huge.
Why are you responding to them?
"And, insider advantage is a very good pollster."
It has a link to my Patreon.
He just survived getting pew-pewed somewhere in Pennsylvania.
"Please comment, like, subscribe, and tell people about the channel."

We know this because CBS News had crews at each of those events over the past week.
He claims that he built the entire military.
I'd like to introduce Beth Leeper.
I'm going to share some photos and possibly some videos here.
What do you want to see in terms of change?
"And Tim Ryan kind of trying to appeal to those voters, even though Vance did kind of underperform in this part of the district."
And he spoke to those who may still be undecided.
"But the fact that Quinnipiac, which again, vastly overstated Biden support in 2020, has Harris barely winning?"
"And the immediate ring around Atlanta, if you will, is very blue."
"And if you look at the board, the Democrats have to win almost all of the swing states, including the two heavyweights, which are Michigan and Pennsylvania."
"I just asked them, are you okay?"
"We are going to be talking about three battleground state polls, one state in particular, Pennsylvania, that has seen the New York Times, Quinnipiac University, and Franklin and Marshall College in three consecutive days."
That's so cool.
Friendships are broken off because of it.
So if you've got questions about this holler at me too.
He continues to say that he won Pennsylvania twice.
"People are making six figures working in this industry, and they pump that money back into the economy."
"So we got significant majority don't approve of Snippy, and yet a significant majority do approve of Lormoger Shapiro."
Because it is clear from internal Harris campaign data that this group is more up for grabs than it was in 2020 or even 2016.
"Put up, okay, good."
That's the bottom line.
And he has used racist terms to describe immigrants.
"So when Trump is running, I have to expect that it's gonna have that same situation and Trump created in the eighties."
"And look, I actually want to admit that I was wrong about something."
"Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one."
You can join ground news with their special offer and say 40 percent on the same plan that I use the Vantage plan.
"So yeah, I mean, I would say this is normal."
So there's a conflict between this big and important industry of extracting oil and natural gas from the ground and the Harris-Biden administration.
If my numbers were off.
"Senator Casey was only for one exception, which was life in the mind."
"Rachel, thank you for joining us as you just heard there."
Welcome to all of you.
"I mean, he's well known in Pennsylvania, which is one of those states that they want to be able to carry."
They shot me in the ear.
"Now, the other thing about this state today that I think is interesting, we're going to talk about this a little bit later in more detail, is the Senate races, because Casey, the Democratic senators, is in a tough race."
Trump was up 0.2 percent before this poll came out.
"She has direction, and I think it evens a playing field for the two candidates."
"Amanda, you voted for Trump twice, but you're not going to this year."
"But if the same point misaccurs or just half of it, just Harris plus or I should say a two to three point miss, you're talking about a Trump plus two victory in Pennsylvania."
And that's when you start hearing about truckloads of ballots.
"There Donald Trump just has a six point lead, which is no lead really."
She's got demographic problems there.
Fight.
And it's kind of illustrative as to his thoughts on the abortion issue in general.
That that's a that's a real risk for him.
"I mean, I've seen him when the cameras are on and when they're off."
Each campaign is rolling out different ideas on the daily.
I don't care.
"And since abortion is one of few winning issues for Democrats at the moment, that could be playing a role in these more favorable numbers here for them."
Jason.
Pennsylvania is the largest with 19 electoral votes.
"And so I think Kamala Harris needs to make sure she's continuing to fight these legal matters right now and then obviously being prepared for what happens later, what comes later."
So that's why you see him going there.
"President Trump is somebody that I appreciate for his fight, his tenacity, his wisdom, and his ability to get things done."
I'll put a new one in.
Those those pollsters suck.
Governor Tim Walz is speaking at Labor Fest in Milwaukee.
"Again, Harris won the poll by two points."
We want to be tough on immigration.
"The week before the DNC, she came to Pennsylvania and she didn't go to Philly or Pittsburgh."
"So, Governor, before I turn it back to Al, we obviously have a very critical plant right there with my dear friend, Senator Casey."
It's only three hundred and fifty thousand.
Long time in a long time.
And Trump says maggot Hagerman of the failing New York Times falsely reported that I was disappointed with the crowds.
"The only poll 10% black and 70% white and you're like, oh man, that's not good."
But I can't change that because they believe it because they've heard it so many times.
He's independent.
So you give them one or two point sample increase because they always under sample.
"His name is going to be on there, embossed, right next to Luke."
There'll be extra security on Capitol Hill this coming January 6th.
Why would he mention?
 I'm being told at times that these are like right wing values.
She's my jackpot.
And what I'm trying to do is use a platform that I have and urging the vice president to chart a new course on what's happening.
Their support for Harris could help her make inroads in a state where every vote matters.
There's 13 million people in the state.
What makes Donald Trump so special?
I think he's been a fantastic President.
And we're looking for a presidential candidate who takes these values and applies them globally.
"Yeah, if you look at the history of Pennsylvania, seven of the last eight presidential elections, Pennsylvania has gone to the Democrats in 2024."
"This shocking event only intensified the focus on Pennsylvania, cementing it as the most crucial battleground for both campaigns."
"So Let's say Kamala Harris probably gains not as much as Biden did in the Philadelphia suburbs But the Bucks are likely zoomed right actually, but like month Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, right?"
There have been a lot of positions that she took prior to 2020 in which she's changed course.
He will use the Department of Justice.
"And of course, he had a hand in January 6th."
"Personally, one, he does benefit, would benefit from a salt cap increase."
"Specifically, there are concerns about Nikki Liu, Harris's campaign manager in the state."
And there are some issues with respect to water use in the fracking process.
They're hemorrhaging their support.
It was a mix of several things but Trump is still breaking records with the zombie vote and he technically does it again in Indiana.
"Well, we've got 157,000 of them here for Nikki Haley, and that just under 17 percent that you mentioned."
Which is exactly why we need Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States of America.
"And that that all so that that's confusing in itself and polls always show something different, obviously."
They hear Donald Trump about killing common sense legislation to address the proliferations of guns.
"But like I said before, this doesn't mean that Harris will for sure win Pennsylvania."
And he did that.
"Where was the question of like, how are we going to pay for that?"
Pennsylvania is not a sure bet for Democrats.
Link to that's always in the description.
There's a lot of chatter about is Harris doing enough to run through the tape?
"I'm sure there's some things that we would disagree on policy wise, but I think what most Americans feel is a deep commitment to this country and a desire to do right by this country."
This is a blue wave.
"And just looking at this, they were more than likely overwhelmingly Jewish."
What are you watching on election night?
And we'll see those continue as Nathan Wade is answering questions at the house today.
"And now people were like, yeah, okay."
"So Governor, before I turn it back to our we obviously have a very critical race."
"You know, trillions of dollars wasted, thousands of Americans dead, tens of thousands wounded, hundreds of thousands with the invisible wounds of war."
He's not even giving us a choice.
Do they convert to Trump?
"Finally, I think, Vice President Harris, whoever she picks, we're going to stand behind her, she's going to do a great job."
Is there anything you didn't hear tonight that you wanted to hear?
What he has said and what he will do is return us to a time when young black men are walled off from opportunity.
"Go listen to Battleground Live, everybody."
And we actually got a Harris plus three last night after two nights in a row of Trump plus three.
"Well, it's not."
"What we're seeing in a lot of these primaries is a test of how far the simple backing of Donald Trump will carry you, whatever your past record happens to be."
This is a really really big deal for the race Because again even like the smallest of a margin if you have two percent 1.5 votes time and then you get point four and Trump gets point one.
Difficult.
Just like the economy when it's run by Donald J. fucking Trump.
"But I'm just curious, as you've been covering this election, as we know, it's unprecedented what we're dealing with right now."
How come B plus?
"And then when Hillary Clinton came in, she went all the way down to 37 with Joe Biden at about 40% of the votes in 2020."
And here we are and we're some 24 days out now.
And there are counties around Allegheny County that Trump carried.
Arizona really seems to be trending.
"It is true that they're tied in the state right now, but that means that Donald Trump is actually winning because he typically underperforms in public opinion polls and does better on election day."
"Well, that's right, the former president was in Central Wisconsin courting voters at an airport hangar rally."
"Now, it's true that with these white college graduate voters, Harris may make some gains by how much we could, you know, question that."
That's your easiest pathway to winning.
He's left the door open for pretty much any time from now until that big event in order to make that big announcement.
"So too, I mean, remember at the DNC, he spoke first instead of speaking his ass and then he left."
And this rambler doesn't know when to hold them and when to fold them.
We will stop the invasion.
You haven't asked about inflation.
He's an absolute fearless savage beast.
"Meanwhile, a New York Times-Siana poll now shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in three key battleground states."
Please.
"Well, you're my name is Derek."
"But I think it's much more plausible that this happens than, oh, yeah, Trump is able to run the table everywhere else."
"The fourth poll was conducted between September 11th and 16 by the New York Times, Siena College among 1,082 registered voters."
"Even in North Carolina, I think you underperformed his 538 polling aggregate on election day by about 0.2, which is not a serious amount."
Anybody who's not white Christian nationalist has to go.
And yet Trump has really not been able to catch up when it comes to that ground game.
It's OK with me.
She's in office.
And u who is undecided who they election?
Look at that.
"There's a reason for this and that's due to economic policy, I think mainly."
"Finally, the last poll in the image conducted by Patriot polling from September 27 to 29 with 816 registered voters shows Trump leading Harris by one point, polling at 50% compared to Harris's 49%."
The party ID looks good for a potential Republican popular vote victory or a very narrow loss.
"In a two-to-one decision, the Commonwealth Court upheld a county judge's month-old order."
Even if he still ends up getting convicted.
"And for that, jackpot gets three out of four worth killing four kisses."
"Remember, it was only two weeks ago that President Biden exited the race and that the party rallied behind Harris to replace him at the top of the ticket."
"I think The Washington Post said, would the real populist please stand up?"
"Now, the early poll for Fox in Pennsylvania in 2022 actually had Federman up by like 11, but they also had a lot of undecideds."
"Joe Biden even referring to the night as a terrible, terrible evening for him in his campaign."
"And to help her do it, she needs a Senate full of public servants like Ruben Gallego."
Matt Gorman and Caitlin Huey-Burns are with us now here at the table in Washington.
CBS News tied Washington Post.
"The joy that you're bringing back to the country, the enthusiasm that's out there, it would be a privilege to take this with you across the country."

"If Trump can't deliver us what we want on tax policy, but Harris can potentially with a Republican Senate, that's what we need to be voting for this time so that we can take the presidency back in 28."
"By the way, we created this Venn diagram at the Midas Touch Network just to help Maggots understand things."

"But it all comes down to Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania is essentially, you know, stuff might happen in North Carolina now, especially because of the hurricane."
Then ask yourself this too while you're at it.
All you see is Trump.
"But nuclear politics, I'm only using as a point of reference because their website is really strong in comparison to some others, and also tells us a lot about where Biden was and where Harris is now, just as a point of reference, as a point of comparison, but I will say, I do not believe Kamala Harris is up by one point, sorry, Donald Trump is up by 1.8% in Pennsylvania right now, because what we have seen is a massive, massive reduction in terms of support from the past for Trump compared to when he was running against Biden."
She has this.

Will there be any guardrails for another Trump presidency?
"Because Kamala can't handle the pressure of an interview with Fox News, she certainly can't handle the pressure of being president of the United States."
Every president has to cut their own path.
That's a five-point shift from 2020.
"Because even if Trump were to win North Carolina and Georgia and Arizona, three states he's currently leading in the polls right now, if Harris wins Wisconsin and Michigan and Nevada, three states she's leading in right now, she would win the presidency."
But guess what?

Trump commerce to labor to FEMA.
It was all Roe versus Wade for their paid advertising.

"Over to the southeast we go, starting in Georgia."
"And, you know, by the time we get to Election Day, it's going to be much more than 22."

There will be more connection to the Board of Supervisors.
"But here they are, the Harris campaign truly believes, based on my conversations with top advisors, that she can make inroads with traditional Republicans who don't like former President Trump's conduct, his character."

"There have been widespread calls to bring Pennsylvania in line with the majority of other states, where election workers get a head start on opening envelopes and flattening ballots ahead of election day."
"Oh my God, I can't handle this."
Former President Donald Trump is holding a town hall with Latino voters.
And David McCormick's is like a double red flag.
"We don't know if it's somebody who is just insane, but regardless, they're going to throw every dollar that they have at it."

I wonder why.
"Well, you better than four years ago, 43%."
"You stood in that space as an honest broker on the subject, and it really turned heads in a way that I think still turn."

"Ryan Bowyer, who as the first black head of the city's building trades council, one of the most powerful labor leaders in the state, this guy says, you know, I have concerns about Nikki Liu."
Chanel.
Same poll has Trump up seven.

"Whereas again in Arizona, Democrats have now won the last 5 straight major statewide races for president, senate, and governor."
"A former top aide to the governor, Mike Verb, was accused of sexual harassment by a female subordinate."
"And to your point, Haley has not made it seem that she wants her supporters to vote for Biden, although she also hasn't endorsed Trump."

"In modern political history, though, I've seen some weird shit like Mitt Romney freezing up on stage and saying like horses and bayonets."
"Listen, I had to come and talk about the situation that happened earlier today with Trump."
"Explain your decision, why that matters to you."
She recently also spread lies about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Ohio.
"It does, doesn't it?"
So already you're probably a 264.
"We tagged along as she headed out to knock doors in nearby Mannheim Township, a growing suburban area that Democrats are targeting this cycle."
"However, in the 2020 US presidential elections, Joe Biden won the electoral votes in Pennsylvania with 1.17% more votes than Trump."
"And it's unfortunate again, because it didn't have to happen because Donald Trump is in office."
And then Bloomberg morning counter poll Trump is also up by two.

So I think that I'm not sure how many persuadable voters there are out there.
"Florida's Hispanic vote, a battle for influence."
This is a disgrace.

Our family friend is 67 now.
What what can you tell us what that was like?
They feel like they are defending a little guy by trying to say that JD Vance is somehow a bad person because of the whole cat lady comment.
"And even the cars, if you look, they want to go with all electric cars."
So she went from down to plus five.
What do I mean by this?
Vote for Tim Wols as the next vice president of the United States.
"Look, I think this whole election we're getting, the contrast you're seeing between these campaigns is that I think the Harris people for understandable reasons are very frustrated that most Americans or half of America doesn't see the Donald Trump that they see."
"On the other hand, Donald Trump only got slightly over 80% of the votes, about 460,000 votes."
Pennsylvania is the big win.
And these are sponsored by American Thinker.
Now it's Harris plus 11.
I'm just getting this just as soon as you guys are Trump shooter.
"So I'm not sure that Cleveland Cliffs coming in with a basically saying, we'll buy this at a bargain basement price."
President Joe Biden is headlining the Philadelphia Democratic Party's get out the vote dinner tonight in South Philadelphia.

What school is that?
And they want to support the sandwich generation which is usually people in their 30s to 50s who are simultaneously taking care of their aging parents as well as their own children.
"Vice President Harris and former President Trump returning to the trail today, traveling to critical battleground states on opposite ends of the country."
Some of these are still outside the margin of error.
"Fast forward after 2020 and Trump's false or false claims about the election, you've started to see Republicans kind of backtrack on that."
"So now they're looking more at Bob Casey thinking, okay, maybe this is a guy who can pick, we can pick off."
A couple more days in Pennsylvania.
I'll show you what the numbers show right here.
That's the biggest problem for Trump.
"Thank you so much, Steve Kornacki."
"As the saying goes, if you're not at the table, you're on the menu."
The primaries are so they can be so localized even when people try to nationalize them.
"However, in these sort of focus groups, I've heard from people that when you actually bring up abortion, it sort of lights a fire in the room for a lot of women, especially."
I just felt her Passion response and that she would carry it out and that resonated with you in the moment.
"Obviously, as you know, the race in Pennsylvania raised her thin."
Change his tire.
"They're basically even on this question now, but that was not the case when we polled this race a month ago."
"Obviously Democrats have way more mail-in ballots just in general in 2020, 878 K Republicans were at 305 K Republicans have gone down by almost 7% so you can see there's still, they've gone down by about 22 K in terms of mail-in ballot requests as opposed to Democrats well over a hundred K almost like 130 K total in terms of that."

"He can actually bring over some independent Republican votes in the Commonwealth, which I think she would have a much harder time doing on her own."
"Obviously, we like trade protectionism, but we also want to be tough on the border."
I think that's that remains to be seen.
"For the sake of simplicity, this is decision desk ace Hughes map."
This is Trump's hood.
It was a he and comes back a she.
We know that he is endorsed by former President Donald Trump.
I'm excited that he's working with Trump.
And I'm just going to show you how important it is.
They're fun races.
And that's why we go back to talking about Pennsylvania and a couple of other states that North Carolina and Georgia are ones that come to mind that.
Democrats can't afford to lose any ground with that demographic.
"But are if the past is is what we would expect in this case, they will probably end up voting for him in the end."
"That was my criticism watching it, is that it was overly edited and that it didn't really allow for a deeper discourse or a more thoughtful..."

"You know what else is real, dude?"
The links on the community tab.
"They're yelling in the direction at us, yelling in the direction of authorities but they are emptying out."
To their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next that is immoral and One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree The government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body That sound obviously that moment was a critical moment Not just for the debate on one of the critical issues of this campaign on the issue of reproductive rights and abortion But there's also one that garnered significant reaction from our focus group Don't ask about right now for those of you who responded positively to Vice President Harris's answer.
They have been the worst three weeks of this campaign that was launched in 2022.
The thirteenth poll was conducted between September 19th and 25 by morning consult with 924 likely voters.
"That would put him over the top with Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin and Michigan still on the table."
"So on some level, you know, he's not he is an avatar of what we."
So they're going to come back and now have this bombshell in 2024.
Access to reproductive rights is a key issue for Democrats heading into November.
"I could see maybe a point, maybe two."
"I think one of the things that is most striking is how just a few weeks ago and a few months ago, the conversation was about, is Joe Biden capable, physically and mentally, of performing the job of the president?"
He's got a digital recorder now.
Don't just surround yourself with stuff that confirms what you already think.
"Did see, was seen with him earlier this month for Hurricane Helene efforts."
You can see there's a clear attack.
This is a topic that can be tough.
Let's have some real talk here.
I'm coming back.
"But nonetheless, it's still a very good poll for Harris."
"The Trump campaign, let's start there, claims that it was hacked."
Dr. Oz is a man who truly believes in Make America Great Again or the MAGA movement.
"So we'll check out 538, latest polls for President of the United States in the great state of Pennsylvania and very, very close race."
"It is said, the winner of Pennsylvania will win."
And this is higher than Trump ever got in our poll when he was actually president.
I'm all right.
"And I said, Well, we don't have to be that way."
I'll keep saying what are we going to do about project 2025?
And apparently he is going to round up undocumented immigrants in the country as well.
So be open-minded.
Maybe you could argue it leans blue.
"If the same error occurs, not even that, just a two point miss, not a three point miss, that's still a Trump win."
"So Raymond, I really appreciate this."
Great job.
And the economy is very important in Pennsylvania.
"This is a lie, man It needs to change."
These are not traditional places that Republicans go.
It is shameful.
There's roads named after him there.
They don't want to do it.
"Well, these polls suggest no."
"Christian, great to see you again."
And this is why Rupert Murdoch and some others are pulling the ripcord and trying to get the hell out of here.
"It is a small margin at the moment, 478,000 total, but the difference there is about 277."

"I've never been a red, maggot wearing guy."
"And even if he does lose some with, you know, white college educated voters, he loses some of these supporters."
But then you go one more ring out.
"All the institutions lied to you saying like there were this many jobs and really, they had to adjust the numbers down."
Betters on polymarket are putting the race at 53 to 44 for Trump with Harris up 6 percentage points in the past week.
"So in terms of the Poly Market website, this is actually a big one right now where we have like a lot of the election betting going on."
"If Biden did that, could you imagine how much Kamala Harris is going to actually overperform the numbers?"
All the better.
Yeah I asked the White House press secretary if she thinks this is appropriate if the president thinks this is appropriate at a time when you have some legal experts saying that what Elon Musk is doing is clearly a legal vote buying she essentially said that they've got to leave it up to the federal election Commission but take a listen to what else she said here.
Three cheers for Donald Trump.
"And I really think the naming of governor, Shapiro, could damage those chances."
That's why her campaign's talked about North Carolina doesn't really seem as if that state is going to be going in the left direction this election cycle regardless.
"Jake, thanks very much."
"And if you're in Pennsylvania, vote."
I spent a lot of time in Northampton County.
"If a Harris-Shapiro campaign were to win in November, Shapiro would be the first Jewish vice president."
"Yeah, and President Biden, as you know, he often touts his humble Pennsylvania roots from Scranton."
What we were saying when she made the pick was do no harm.
That's a really small margin.
He has a lead in Georgia.
"I'll look at it at the time and that was at that time an extraordinary thing to say I mean my jaw-drap because I was still looking at things the way things have always been traditionally done You know, of course, you're going to abide by it But so he said that and the other thing he said during those same debates was that if he won He might want to prosecute Hillary Clinton and there was some line that he in one of the debates that you know You're gonna be in jail or you should be in jail just awfully good that someone With the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country because you'd be in jail Secretary so he was signaling this whole notion of You're going to prosecute your political enemies and nobody had ever talked that way before Those were the two main things that led me to write those things is clear and present danger and you know, I I Lament the fact that they have now been born out by reality Yeah, and what do you think will happen if Trump loses in November if he loses in November?"
"You're probably doing well in the really big counties, too."

"If you will recall, Donald Trump won all the electoral votes in Pennsylvania in the 2016 US presidential elections by a margin of 0.72%."
"They've done a lot in our community and are being humble about it, but this year it's important to make sure we're communicating the impact that the administration has had locally."
Cause you guys know the way it works and you vote in the primary.
"But Percepts most significantly in that O'Brien essay that he wrote in Foreign Affairs is a major shift in attention to the Pacific, to the Indo-Pacific, including deploying the entire US Marine Corps there as it was in World War II and a big naval focus, less focus on counterinsurgency and a strategic delinkage with the Chinese economy."
Section 5 â€“ The People's Concerns Attendees at the rally expressed a range of concerns heading into the 2024 election.
What's another one to watch?
Back in 2020 Democrats made up roughly 63% of absentee requests.
"And so Kamala went on to Charlemagne the Gods podcast, Breakfast Club Power Hour, 105.1 FM."
"In fact, a lot of people were conflating this for firecrackers that didn't go down until they saw the former president get rushed by his security detail."

There's also a Discord server for you to go ahead and join on the screen.
"While Trump still holds considerable sway over Pennsylvania's large white working-class population, 75 percent of the state identifies as non-Hispanic white."

"Likewise, another contract that asks if Trump will win every swing state is down 4 percentage points in the last week and 35 percentage points in the last month since Biden's gaffered in performance debating Trump."
So does that discredit this current Quinnipiac poll and Trump is actually leading in Pennsylvania?
You should love it.
But then came Quinnipiac University.
"You know, my dear friend, Senator Casey, do you expect that Senator Casey will run a little bit ahead of Vice President Harris?"

"They were coming in through a system that we had, which was great because I'm the best thing that ever happened to farmers."
I got home and my husband could not stop laughing.
Women used to die that way.
"Can't stream the debate, but maybe I'll live tweet it."
It is likely that the survey conductors believe they had an insufficient sample that did not represent a portion of Trump's support and corrected for that in their new polls rather than it representing such a large swing across the state.
We'll see over 100 million spent by the end of the election.
Kamala Harris received 50% of the vote and Donald Trump 47%.
You never draw them.
"It's time to honor the work that was done by our ancestors over the last 248 years to expand and protect our freedoms, not rip them away and to stand up for decency and honor."

"So obviously, the candidates think it's an important issue."
That really?

She said she supported a taxpayer-funded Gender transition surgeries for detained migrants.
What happens in your confidence in the election going forward?
"So if folks out there are concerned about this issue or concerned about costs, but if you're just concerned about keeping a majority in the United States Senate, I hope they will help us by going to bobkasey.com."
Well she has a whole post dedicated to that one which is boom.
"So like I just I'm so annoyed by the double standard of this man who, you know, clearly there's a part of me that thinks he'd be OK if she lost Pennsylvania so then he can challenge her next election cycle."
It looks like anywhere from eight to 10 bullets were fired.
The most recent poll for the New York Times shows Harris is closing in on Donald Trump in a number of swing states.
" Pennsylvania's latest poll results are just unbelievable, and today we will analyze all the eight latest poll results conducted in this state."

"Hey, Sean Hannity here."
"Today, we're diving into the polls for the 2024 US presidential election, focusing specifically on TENSILVANIA, a state known for its razor-thin election results."
We just don't know but Pennsylvania is a crucial state for Donald Trump and he never led in Pennsylvania back in 2020.
I think you have to investigate the other side of it.
What is the Harris coalition look like?
"Again, I try to be as close to late September as possible, but Emerson in 2020, in the same time period, it was D plus five."
"Well, the Harris campaign stance is that they are still the underdogs in this race."
And so Kamala Harris now narrowing down even pre-VP selection in Pennsylvania goes to show that Democrats are in a far better position.
Pennsylvania has a very important influence in determining the next president of the United States.
"Harris was there on Monday speaking to a crowd of about 6,000 in Erie and then Governor Walls was hitting some of the rural counties surrounding Erie Pennsylvania as well."
"She says these are the words of an autocrat, someone who is threatening to use the military in this way."
Even RMG research the same pollster.
 Vice President Kamala Harris tells union workers in Pittsburgh she'll oppose the sale of U.S. Steel.
"You know, they remain red."
"Democrats technically are increasing their raw vote totals and their firewall, which is expected because, you know, the mail-in vote is overwhelmingly Democrat."
Pivotal this morning.

" In Arizona, former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis is now cooperating with prosecutors in the state's fake electors case, according to that state's attorney general."
"For those that don't remember, polling in Pennsylvania can be pretty bad."
It's a town hall.
So Trump is doing five to seven points better than he was doing in Pennsylvania polling four years ago.
You can tell from that last exchange how it's possible to have a civil dialogue with people you disagree with.
I don't care what they say.
This is massive.
That is something she said she was in favor of in 2019.
But I am not here just to talk about football.
Thank you for subscribing.

I will look at it at the time I'm not looking at anything now.
"He is a, you know, businessman."
So that's why in the headline Quinnipiac basically said that one is a up for grabs state Wisconsin.
So this is something that they want to see continue to tie together along with funding for the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan.
American prisoners release just happened.
These are fun ones.
"No, but I think he really needs Philly, and he's struggling with young black voters in particular."
"And we know, according to polling, according to, you know, some very preliminary early data, that we have in North Carolina and Georgia, seems like the turnout dynamic is going to give Donald Trump a boost in those two states."
"Bitcoin traded below $50,000 during Asia business hours Monday before recovering."
They released one clip about that from that interview.
Every Monday and Thursday only on First Post.
The majority are at least a plurality of their supporters.
"Negative partisanship is the most effective campaigning tool in any race, from city council to the race for president."
So how within the next 65 days does either of these candidates actually pull ahead?
"But having said that, again, we have four years of experience with Trump."
And what the next 50 some odd days will do is allow her to get out on the campaign trail and share those priorities directly with the American people.
I don't think presidents have a huge deal to do with gas prices.
"Yesterday, he and his running mate, JD Vance, attended a rally in the swing state of Georgia."
You know what?
"And in this poll, Quinnipiac had Biden at 54, Trump at 41, a plus 13 margin."
Stierwald's insights regarding the importance of Erie County and Northampton County highlight how local issues can significantly influence voter sentiment.
Have you heard this stuff?
"And basically how it works is that if Biden doesn't win Pennsylvania, the chances of him and Trump going to a 269-269 electoral college tie is exponentially higher."
"And if you're vice president Harris, you're seeing the surge of support among black women."
"The 2024 election is shaping up to be one of the most consequential in recent history, with the potential to redefine the political landscape for years to come."
"For starters, the big counties like Philly, Allegheny, Chester, you know, Democrat areas, they started returning ballots much earlier than the rest of the state."
I broke out in 2017.
"But if you're a Democrat, you don't want to rely just on election day because if it's very high turnout on election day more than likely those voters are going to lean towards Trump."
They found Harris only up by a point.
And so folks want to continue to see a bright economic future and they want a leader who's going to fight for that future.
I have never seen anything like this.
"Meanwhile, polls are showing the two candidates in a dead heat and voters are excited here in this key swing state."
We're gearing up.
"So that's something key to remember Kamala Harris, let's give her Wisconsin and Michigan if she also gets Pennsylvania nothing else matters."
We pray for you.
"But Trump still pulled it off, you know, by winning those key swing states."
I'm just saying that you can't underestimate the stupidity of the general public and how many NPCs there are in this election.
Are you ready to go?
Here's how he described it to me.
I'm kidding.
There's polling out of both of these counties.
"Now, if it is in fact the tipping point state, is there any elected official in Pennsylvania who may have been on a ticket that might have made a difference?"
And what I've been hearing in the last few days in this kind of stretch across western Pennsylvania where both campaigns are spending considerable amounts of time looking at this state concentrated in that area.
What you waiting for?
"And so, OK, we've talked about the cultural aspect of things, but let's talk money for a second, because you're a top member of the Harris campaign's finance team."
Far more Democrats and Republicans vote by mail in Pennsylvania.
So how much is he hurting himself when he loses focus on that specific issue?
"I find it very unlikely that every pollster, including ones like Mollenburg and Fox News, the fact they have the race tied just like Rasmussen and Sussacwon, even inside her advantage, she had the race Trump plus two."
"That is 285,000 Democrat ballots that have been submitted and 95,000 Republican ballots that have been submitted and then 36,000 independent ballots that have been submitted."
I heard Trump give me his inaugural speech.
A lot of Americans hear that shit and they fucking start frothing at the mouth.
No doubt about that.
"It's a method by which you extract natural gas, which is the cleanest fossil fuel in America."
Six weeks out.
I'm sure Biden was also there.
"It has to be, again, by rule of law."
"And then I say, so this whole thing is insane."
"Again, that's a little bit more favorable for the Republican than the actual voter registration as of 2023."
Now let's get started.
"Of the tiny amount in swing states, Northampton County was the closest in 2020."
"In 2020, she voted for Biden."
"Well, since day one, I observed him to be a man who is not mentally fit for the job."
"And veterans furthermore do not take kindly to the Biden-Kamala Harris debacle of pulling out of Afghanistan, which caused 13 Gold Star families."
" Hey everyone, welcome back to the channel."
Trump house.
"But, you know, I'm hearing from some Democrats, it's still hard to get a turnout and Trump is cutting into some of that black vote in the city."
"At the bar, a veteran for Trump is struggling in this economy."
What's going on here?
"People were afraid, and they've lost everything."
But the fact remains that Trump has not disassociated himself from her as much as some of his supporters will.
And I think folks see through that.
"Do you believe some of the voters who went for Haley in Pennsylvania, might they have reservations about having a possible felon on the ticket as their nominee in November?"
Watch the horse ship while you're talking and be careful.
The state's expected to be so close that the slightest change from last time could really make a difference.
"Having Trump, former President Trump, back in president, having his hands on the buttons of controls makes me really nervous."
"I mean you combine this concert yesterday with he's campaigning in California, he's campaigning in New York."
But Harris is directly tethered to those policies.
"For decades, Pennsylvania has played a crucial role in determining the outcome of presidential elections, earning its reputation as a swing state."
Where's then the raw data?
He and his colleagues used this foundation to develop a sort of game that rewards drivers who don't use their phones in the car and puts them in competition with other drivers who are trying to do the same.
"But then, you know, he's talked about on the campaign trail this idea of deporting all folks who are in the U.S. illegally."
"Well, John, first of all, it's always good to be with you."
Do you guys think this was the right move for Trump?
"We're bringing our political panel, Nancy Cook and Sabrina Rodriguez."
"So to all the other leaders who are also here, the parents, the grandparents, the advocates, the teachers, the community leaders, I thank you for the work you have done over so many years to make sure that this community and by extension as a role model many communities around our country that they have access to as Michael Regan said one of the most basic and essential resources which is clean water."
I guess it's maybe possible.
So it's probably kind of around a tie here.
That bill was for 180 police officers to patrol inside and outside the TCC Center for six and a half hours.
Election experts raise fresh alarms.
Such regions include Beaver County.
But of course we know the real reason they do not want actual election integrity.
The idea of intentionally trying to deceive people in their most desperate and vulnerable moments and my question is when did that become okay?
"Shares of US Steel sliding for a second day as President Biden voicing opposition to that planned sale to Japan's Nippon Steel, while Donald Trump recently promised to block the takeover instantaneously."
So I'm looking forward to November.
While Trump still commands a majority in these areas.
A stone newly discovered in a cave in Bucks County could prove it was a hiding place for the legendary band of 18th century outlaws known as the Doan Gang.
"And by the way, these are also issues of real freedom."
And that helped Trump because his enthusiasm numbers were through the roof compared to Biden.
"It encompasses the mobilization of specific demographics, whose votes could swing the state decisively."
That's where the unfavorable numbers on the Biden presidency are really coming from.
"I can't, I don't, you know, look, man, I don't buy this about that many black people voting Trump."
It's really focused on the economy and it's focused on manufacturing.
What do we know about Wisconsin and the tightness of the race in that battleground?
You need me.
"So Pennsylvania, that is the choice in this election."
So when the President and I took office across our nation we decided to deal with this we decided to deal with the fact that Americans in up to 10 million homes and children in thousands of schools and child care facilities had to drink water coming out of lead pipes.
"We could also debate how much that's going to be and we got to get everybody voting, including men, because men voted, you know, rates that are a little bit less than women."
It's not like he's barely in a stronger position.
And it's all total gaslighting because originally Trump opened up everything too soon.
Shapiro is strong.
"Like if you own a computer, you're always going to have to be upgrading the parts and stuff, but you upgrade it when you want to upgrade it."
These are the kind of kind of voters we're going to be watching throughout the year.
"John Federman, right?"
Very important policy difference.
"Yeah, Emerson found Trump with a small lead."
Vote for Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States.
"Pennsylvania is home to more than a million Latinos and as far as those that are registered to vote, that number is in the six figures."
" Hello, Tucson!"
"They're really banking on the idea that, well, these far right pollsters like Insider Advantage, Emerson, Trafalgar, they're going to understate Harris."
And this is exactly where President Biden was just a few days ago.
He was a billionaire going into this.
But now the polls show that the race has tightened and Trump is closing the gap.
You don't miss a beat.
So Quinnipiac did a series of polls in several swing states.
But we're going to see these candidates out here several more times before election day.
So this is part of that effort to court suburban women.
I kept my word and I will keep my word.
What do you think that's going to do for the economy?
"He clearly, it is getting to him that Kamala Harris has signed on to that no taxes on tips policy."
"In the show's part two that premiered early this year, Morelos got to display her singing talent for the first time in the series."
But and then the answer afterwards is about the economy.
"But Senator, talk about this, how abortion and how this is playing out in your race."
"However their recent poll in mid September had Trump gaining a single point to hit 46 while Harris dropped 4 to tie him at 46, another tie, a net gain of 5 for Trump."
Their mail-in balance aren't coming in like they did in the past because people aren't enthusiastic about Kamala Harris and the entire Democratic ticket.
"So Selena, if you had to bet your house, who would you bet Pennsylvania goes to in November?"
What I cannot understand is why anyone would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you.
I actually dismissed it for a long period of my life saying that caves were probably only part of the folklore and the mystique of the Doans.
I will not ban fracking.
"Pay one low price for your treatments, online visits, ongoing shipments and provider messaging."
"Now you could make a strong case that Michigan is a must-win for Harris, just like North Carolina is a must-win for Trump."
We think what happened to Ukraine was very bad.
"And it was crazy that they had a video with the 50 cent and they was showing Trump walking through and like, many men wish death upon me."
They want to do lots of little things like that.
"I'm walking around, I'm seeing former Congressman Jim Greenwood, moderate Republican from years ago in the House of Representatives, former Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois is here, former Congressman Denver Riggleman of Virginia."
"This was after Donald Trump's lawyer argued during oral argument that January 6th was not an insurrection, but that it was a vile and shameful and violent crime that took place."
But we're going to keep working to get our vote out and to get Kamala's vote out to win this race.
"Keep in mind that while the content may not always align with the official standpoint of 6Do brief, it's not meant to be taken as absolute directives for decision-making."
And then obviously things shifted there.
And more than 50 firefighters have battled a blaze in one Dauphin County community that displaced three people.
"Harris leads former President Donald Trump in Arizona and North Carolina, while trailing narrowly in Nevada."
"I know we got to go, but I think it's important because this is happening in states, especially battleground states."
Turns out a lot of Gen Z Republicans on college campuses are adverse to speaking with the media on camera and being identified as Republican.
You can't explain this to a communist progressive like Kamala Harris because it doesn't affect her.
"So either way, guys, that is going to do it for this video."
Their B-rated polls are likely voters.
"If they win, you're more likely to believe conspiracy theories about that."
One of the biggest reasons I'm voting for Kamala Harris and I would have voted for Joe Biden is that they are not Donald Trump.
It could break at any point.
The dumbest thing.
Trump and Harris are locked in a virtual tie in two out of eight polls.
"The 2024 US presidential election is reaching its boiling point, and all eyes are on Pennsylvania, a state that has become ground zero for this high-stakes battle."
That's really good stuff.
Make sure to subscribe to my channel down below so you don't miss future editions of this presidential election analysis style of video.
I was did a little bit of digging and I'm just going to show you really quickly a poll from back in 2020 where Quinnipiac was around this time.
I don't know why he wouldn't support that.
Why do you think that is?
A podcast that takes you behind the scenes and stories of politics in North Carolina and across the country.
And that Pennsylvania is the key.
But it's good that we have this this victory at least here.
It's supposed to be a town hall.
" This could be a great sign when it comes to Donald Trump possibly winning the state of Pennsylvania, the most important state of the 2024 election."
It was phony.
"And about health inspections, let me give you a little bit of insight baseball for you guys who may not have restaurant experience, or maybe you've forgotten, or maybe you just didn't have this experience."
I think I would like to see more ads that actually talk about policies and issues.
And a pandemic.
What's the reality?
"The Biden regime has been doing it unlawfully through executive orders, but that's another video."
And that's really why I'm undecided.
The only poll after she became the nominee has her up by two.
How do you think it resonated with folks?
"First of all, what the hell's the matter?"
"Good afternoon, Pittsburgh."
Where are the other people that started screaming about Charleroi?
But Pennsylvania is absolutely the most important swing state in this election.
 Donald Trump is in a strong position to win the key swing state of Pennsylvania.
"Well, in the last video, I mentioned the fact that he probably is, which is what it is."
He's the favorite even in Michigan.
But let me say this.
"So there's a big week coming up and one of the fun things about Rising Fridays is that we get to sort of preview what's happening next week as we go into the weekend to get that lens for as soon as the curtain rises on Monday, there are primaries Tuesday."

So technically the the Korean War is still ongoing.
"So I think you guys for watching this video, please subscribe, share this video with your friends comment down below on what other videos you'd like to see next."
We don't know if someone else was hit.
So I think it's a very important question.
Like me personally like of what I like been through it like in life Like we we've been through it.
Senator Casey.
People who are polled and say they likely will show up and vote Trump at 45%.
Trump said he says Nancy Pelosi caused the insurrection.
"Rubin's support reflects a growing trend of sports figures engaging in political advocacy, using their platforms to influence public opinion and drive change."

"It was not his time, but he's coming soon."
"And then it has this diagram here, which actually notes how much money is being made by middle class people one sec."
I know it looked kind of too easy and only got him in the ear Doesn't look like any bullets hit anybody else.
You know how annoying he's going to be now?
Real strength is about working hard and carrying a heavy load without complaining.
I think he's more intelligent than she is.
"So, you know, you have to communicate that robustly."
Four people suffered burn injuries and one from a fall.
I think it was stolen.
But now what Pennsylvania voters are looking at is Donald Trump's awful track record on manufacturing jobs and his awful job record overall.
So the pace is continuing in terms of people trying to make their voices heard.
"The final poll at 51, Biden got 50, so that was pretty accurate, but very much underestimated Trump support in Pennsylvania enough where Trump was able to pick up about five, six percentage points from where the poll was."
"But you know, I'm going to give him a little bit of credit."
"And then this weird statue of soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo said, Ermigird, that's Sir Scur."

"Georgia has only recently become competitive, North Carolina They have it once since Obama So those are the three states that are the most kind of straightforward path if she wins those she doesn't need anything else provided nothing else flips and so that's the most logical path and It appears to be the way that she's going to be most efficient a couple of important events on the campaign trail as we were just Showing our viewers on Bloomberg TV tomorrow Donald Trump high noon interview right here on Bloomberg TV and radio with our editor-in-chief John michaels wait Wednesday Kamala Harris sitting down for an interview with Brett bear on Fox News These are two important conversations that will be following closely and we'll invite you to our special coverage tomorrow starts 1130 Eastern Time As we walk up to the interview with Donald Trump now We want to turn to the Middle East another important story We're following today with some updates the Pentagon Announcing the US is sending more troops now almost a hundred along with an advanced missile defense system to Israel to help protect from attacks Coming from Iran this comes as Israel has yet to retaliate for the barrage of missiles that Iran fired earlier this month We spoke earlier today with former NSC official Hagar Shemali on the early edition of balance of power It is something that is meant to beef up that that that security to definitely send a message across to all Across the Middle East that the US is going to defend Israel is going to stand and support Israel You know in case of any kind of attack But it certainly indicates that there is they they are expecting something and they want to be there just in case Joined now by Bloomberg's Michelle Jim Risco at the table with us in Washington Michelle We've had a couple of updates not only that defense missile missile defense battery I should say on its way to Israel with dozens of Americans who will be there to run it But Benjamin Netanyahu according to the Washington Post Now saying that Israel will strike the Iran military when it responds We're not sure when that happens and that's as opposed to oil installations or nuclear facilities Does the Biden administration then in fact have some influence after all?"
I'm not that.

And he's not being transparent with the voters.

Maybe not.
It's bought and sold already.
"It has a population of about 4,000 people, a fraction of the size of Springfield, Ohio, which has been the primary target of Donald Trump and J.D."
This poll is within the margin of error.
You know why?

 here is showing a narrow two-point lead over former president Donald Trump that is well within the margin of error our political editor Dennis Welch is here now to break down those numbers yeah and when you say within the margin of error what you're basically saying statistically it's a dead heat now Arizona's family commissioned the survey in partnership with the local public affairs firm high ground and it reaffirms what we've been seeing so far that Arizona's 11 electoral college votes which could determine who wins the White House are still very much in play for both candidates here are the top line numbers they reveal Harris leading Trump 47 percent to 45 the results also reveal that 45 percent of those surveyed say they've already made up their mind to vote for Harris while 41 percent say they will definitely be voting for Trump I think one of the biggest takeaways here is that the race is very close and getting closer we've seen some surveys where Trump has a narrow lead we've seen others where Harris has a slight lead all of them have been within the margin of error Paul Bents is the longtime Arizona pollster who conducted the survey commissioned by Arizona's family his data reveals that Harris is doing a better job convincing voters to cross party lines at this point the vice president has convinced more than 12 percent of likely Republican voters to support her on the other hand Trump has only managed to convince 1.7 percent of Democratic voters to back his candidacy the two candidates are also evenly split with voters who are unaffiliated with any party while Trump is leading by double digits with independence what we're really seeing is that the Democrats are much more solidified behind their candidate they very much circled the wagons whereas Republicans are still struggling internally with at least a portion of their party Harris is also doing better than expected with voters 65 years and older the two candidates are evenly split at 48% among this reliably Republican block and like the previous two presidential cycles Trump is doing much better in rural parts of the state than Harris while the VP leads in Arizona's two most populous counties Maricopa and Pima and this survey was conducted at the end of last week another interesting data point here is the gender gap with Harris winning more than 52 percent of female voters to Trump's 40 percent while Trump is winning over 50 percent of male voters to Harris's 42 percent yes we've been saying for a long time it's going to come down to a couple hundred thousand voters in seven swing states of course Arizona very pivotal and the last presidential race was decided by like ten point five thousand here in Arizona yeah and if you look at the data here maybe it's not surprising but 86 percent are pretty much made up there they're locked in so 14 percent out there maybe maybe could be moving movable but you know it's going to be very close we knew that I know the election is a little over a month away but remember early voting starts next week so we're already in the middle of this and Dennis these were a likely voters not just registered voters yeah these were picked by basically on how often they vote these are people who are reliable voters out there they wanted to get a sense of who were they supporting how are they voting what's going to happen with them now that does leave open some room could there be an influx of new voters out there have Republicans identified voters who haven't typically voted in the last election cycle the last couple could Democrats do the same thing there's always a lot of questions to be answered well with these polls there's always things you can look at with a little suspicion just like every poll but as politicians have told me for years decades now the only poll that matters is in November yeah take a good thing they call this a snapshot in time which is what it is we like it it's interesting to see the breakdown Dennis thank you

Today we're diving into the heated battleground of Pennsylvania as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump ramp up their campaigns for the 2024 election.
"These four battlegrounds have voted for the same candidate as one another in almost every modern presidential election, voting blue in the six elections between 1992 and 2012, before Trump then managed to flip Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, each by less than a point, against Hillary Clinton in 2016."
I was loyal to Barack Obama when I cut my own path as president.
We do not need a president who's willing to make problems worse to make his politics better.
"Harris may focus on energizing younger voters and minorities, who have historically leaned Democratic but may need additional motivation to turn out in significant numbers."
"Therefore, when Democratic candidate Kamala Harris promotes her economic agenda, she heads to Pittsburgh, the industrial heart of Pennsylvania."
I was on the ground in Pennsylvania covering this for the primary.

So thank you all for being here today.

"There was among Democrats who were unhappy about Biden, but there wasn't anything moving or changing."
We're not to the conventions yet.
I hope the crowd just turned around and beat the crap out of that guy.
Demographics that have grown increasingly disillusioned with Trump's rhetoric and policies.
What you're seeing here is that 8.2 percent more people have an unfair 8.2 percent delta between the unfavorable and favorable numbers for Donald Trump.
We got to hold all three of them.
And it was interesting to see because Centre County has been a tightly contested race the last two presidential elections.
"But the more you look at Pennsylvania, the more you realize it's going to be the tipping point state more than likely."
The unions love it.
This is something that nobody can fathom and the pain is so deep that there's just a numbness to it.
I don't know if you've talked to the Harris campaign about this or if they've reached out to you.
He's a convicted felon as well.
81% to about 18.
People just have to get second and third jobs.
I loved it.
So the question is not whether or not we need to do some things different.
It's been practiced now for a couple of years where Democrats are more likely to vote by mail and more likely to vote early.
"They have an advisor playing the role of former President Trump during their mock debates, even dressing up as him."
"ABC News senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott, Fox News host Harris Faulkner, and semaphore political reporter Katia Goba interviewed Trump on stage at the event."

"Whoo, it's hot here."
Did Mexico pay for that wall?
I remember the debate performance.
So it's a long and winding road.
His substantial contribution is a vote of confidence in Harris' ability to make housing more affordable and accessible.
Or will Trump make a last minute surge?
I know what it means for an individual and a family to have home ownership.
Two in the back.
"And the AR-15, I know about that one too."
"Number two, the jobs have been added because the COVID is over or, or I'm not going to say it's over."

"Yes, yes."
"That's another way that the industry of fracking in the United States will be suppressed, because if you're not exporting, then you can't produce it."
So how would you assess how the vice president is doing with three weeks to go.
"So in addition to sort of becoming more aggressive in her messaging about the former president, you see her doing media interviews all over the place."
Much more grassroots.
Maybe she did.
"On crypto Twitter, which remains skeptical of IOC claims, a meme quickly emerged about the easy money to be made betting on contestants accused of being men competing in women's sports."

It's almost like the Republicans have an agenda.
D plus three back then.
"Trump won it by just one percentage point in 2020, but had polled very strongly against Biden this cycle, with an average lead of 4.9% based on 45 polls before the president dropped out."
When I learned of the vice president's return to Pittsburgh as a follow-up to her first visit it made me feel good to know that she genuinely cares and came back to hear the progress that has been made and to check on our communities in the city of Pittsburgh.
All of a sudden he says he's a Republican.
"She's speaking now, as you see."
You get all these exclusive videos.
She's taken it a step farther and is attacking someone who's not commander in chief for showing up to support them.
"Kristen, thanks for joining us today."
"Obviously, Republicans won't talk about this on the record."
But look at Harris voters.
It was Clinton plus six.
"One thing is certain, this race is far from over."
"Biden won the state by around 81,000 votes."
"Oh, I'm so glad that he is okay."
Is that what she's talking about?
Now his remarks were twice interrupted by medical emergencies in the crowd.
"All we can say is he jumped back up, raised his fist in the air."
"Now, I would never stand in line for these atrocities with the direct sunlight."
"Only she just goes, was I, I was against fracking?"
"There's four big fella suburbs, your home territory."
"For example, back in 2020 and roughly the same time period, you know, the middle of October, it was Biden plus seven, plus seven, plus six, plus five, plus four, when he won by a point."
Trump was three points ahead of Harris in this poll.
Clinton was up by six.
And that might be the pro of Dr. Oz.
"I mean, there's some differences here, but this is going to be an extremely close race."
If we see a mountain in front of us she said and all right quotes highlights from her speech at the DNC.
"From Washington, D.C. today."
"John Riebel, just experience an ad."
That's at least a five point swing.
"Let's keep growing as a family and let's make America great again There's little I love that you having somebody up there that you know Don't really in a way you could tell to be nervous, you know, even though it's a lot of trust me It's a lot of rappers a lot of people it took me a while to get to where I am right now You know sometimes when I see different videos and I'm looking at different videos y'all can't tell but sometimes I'd be nervous Tell me y'all you never know though, especially like in that position broad know I'd be shaking But I probably couldn't even get out five words up there standing with Trump But that's amazing though."
"The majority of Americans that will decide this race in six swing states like in my home state of Pennsylvania will be the phone calls, the door knocking, the voter by voter that we need to do to win this race in 75 days."
"This is a massive, massive crowd."
"I mean, whoever that is talking, you already know it's just somebody that didn't like Trump already."
That's exactly who he is.
"It's the baggage of being part of an unpopular administration, the vice president under Joe Biden."
And we're going to talk about the endorsement record a little bit later.
"But if she refuses to certify and then makes herself president, you'd be OK with that?"
"He's a very different kind of governor, Republican or Democrat."
"On health care, Harris has been a vocal advocate for expanding access to affordable and quality coverage."
My favorite is the Trump iconic black mug.
McCormick's guy posted on Twitter this morning.
 new polling out of the key battleground state of Pennsylvania.
And people see that and they're not sure what the truth is.
"The event, held on August 1, 2024, was Trump's first appearance in the state since a harrowing incident at a previous rally, which had left many supporters concerned for his safety."
"Trump will also be returning there to Butler this week as well, his first time back since the first assassination attempt in July."
"107,000."
"However, his pledge would also require the congressional approval."
Donald Trump has managed to bounce back in the last two weeks.
I'm going to tell you something.
"There was actually a strong focus from the Hillary Clinton campaign on Pennsylvania, and yet she lost the state by roughly the same margin that she lost Wisconsin by, even though she had not visited Wisconsin just once, not even once, after the convention in 2016."
"However, we have the strongest economy in the world."
"Again, this is not a Republican."
And there are one hundred and thirty two thousand votes down as of today.
They let the police and security know and nothing was done.
"His opponent, former Prince George's County executive, Angela also Brooks, has been touting Hogan's ties to Trump, but polls show the race is tight."
Make peace with the fact that that man is about to be president.
"I wrote a couple down, Lindsay, so I'll just read them."
"So that's why I believe while this number is more than likely inflated, I still think these are good numbers for the GOP."
More Trump stuff.
Definitely banger Catch y'all next one
Like that's the ego kicking.
It should.
I'll give you just one stat.
"And if he's winning Pennsylvania, so I love your thoughts."
"Use the built-in stand to display him proudly on your desk, or just keep him under your bed."
I have answered the question.
"Yes, ma'am."
Seems like the third party candidates are going to be on the ballot in a lot of these swing states where they can kind of play spoiler.
"The white working-class population, particularly in rural areas and smaller towns, has historically leaned Republican."
"And the, I guess the only other argument could be well considering there were way more Democrats that were afraid of the pandemic and wanted to stay home and vote in 2020."
It just puts a smile on her face as even looking at these cookies.
This is this is the worst possible scenario at an event like this.
"No, I just wanted to see if we can get those bigger."
"If not, you hope that doesn't happen."
And Donald Trump is using that as ammunition.
My name is Anthony Bryan Logan.
"Okay, let's look at the polling right now."
They just were not sold on Biden at all either.
"Thank you very much for joining us Oh, hey, it's just great to be here."
Like I thought you said it was close.
So could I?
One of the most consequential implications of this intricate electoral landscape is the critical role of voter turnout.
"Yeah, I mean, I would agree."
Biden on this day was plus seven.
"So who do I trust insider advantage, which has a a decent track record, not perfect, but it's all right or Suffolk, which is a garbage pollster that doesn't know how to pull out of Pennsylvania and they they dropped a Harris plus three here, which is actually an improvement for Trump compared to 2020 and 2016 or I trust insider advantage."
"Absolutely, sir Thank you so much for your time."
" Well, let me ask you this."
"A lot of them are from New York, New Jersey, Maryland, areas where they're historically more blue."
"I'm like, man, I guess I was wrong."
Who's this?
Am I concerned about that?
"That's up from 46 percent in June, while Republicans are steady at 71 percent."
"Today on CBS mornings, he said he is confident that she will dominate the debate, but no, she'll face some tough questions."
"So late yesterday, Speaker Johnson unveiled new plans for Ford aid, suggesting separating them into separate bills."
"Also, there's a $550 Maga Bling clutch, and one with his name on it, very classy."
Walz's ability to connect with voters on a personal level has been instrumental in his success as governor of Minnesota.
"Guys, thank you both for joining us here on ABC News Live."
"He seems like a dude who's just obsessed with politics and voted for Trump, but then didn't and then wanted Haley."
That's now on the cards.
"I mean, that's that simple."
"Yes, he did."
So they said not clear yet what impact the shooting will have on the RNC security plans.
"And just to add on to what you were saying, you know, we are entrepreneurs."
Age catches up with you at different times for different people.
Is that what she does every day for a living?
"Republicans gained 22,000 voters Democrats gained not even 10,000."
I think about this a lot because it's so different from what we see right now out of the Republican nominee and increasingly the entire party has just decided it's okay.
"I mean, US Steel is not the titan it once was, nor is the US steel making industry."
And I think they're the and it should be very easily handled by if necessary by the national guard or if really necessary by the military because they can't let that happen.
A zero point three percent point Trump win.
"We saw it when no matter the race of the individual who he's talking about, if he doesn't have a substantive message, he starts to go personal."
I had to get out of the shade out of the sun.
We are where the candidates are day in and day out.
Integrity is something that I deeply value.
Mostly.
Nobody in this room has been listening to the analysis We've actually all been talking amongst ourselves.
"You know, the weird thing."
"Today, Kamala Harris leads by one."
"And so now you're thinking about sitting out or even supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, that's not acceptable."
It remains to be seen whether it's this is this is how I cover my my left flank.
"On the other hand, here's Governor Walz."
"Although for an outfit like them who is tied in with major corporate advertisers and who knows who within the deep state and Intel agencies, freedom of speech can be a little bit of a dangerous thing."
You heard from other.
We really appreciate it.
"I don't know, I'm hopeful."
You know who a dictator is?
"Harris is hoping to capitalize on her strong debate performance, even as some undecided voters say they want to know more about her plans, including how she'd address immigration in the economy."
So I think that you also you're going to have to see individuals not only turn out.
"Months after the work was done, my daughter's blood work improved, the frequency of our headaches began to decrease, and my dad's breathing had improved."
"While Trump's proposal targets reducing individual tax bills, his broader economic plans focus on offering tax relief to the companies operating within the United States."
We'll see you next week.
"He won in 2016, narrowly lost in 2020."
And he has the benefit of being a challenger where you don't actually have to go into intricate detail.
I'll say that.
"Top issue safety, world peace."
By the way the following Monday the interview and the swatting took place on Friday.
"So, can Kamala Harris win Pennsylvania?"
"And again, that's the best compliment we could get."
Her argument?
What is his lasting legacy?
"Finally, we have it in t-shirts, sweatshirts, coffee mugs, etc."
We rescind it.
What's right is right.
There really is no in between.
Her love of cooking and dreams of opening a restaurant are relatable to America's foodies.
You can cut the check for Native Americans.
"The reason why honestly, a lot of Bernie voters ended up switching parties and voting for Trump is because of that economic messaging."
"So the first thing we're gonna see here is we're gonna come up here, of course, I mean, I started doing a video, someone wants to go outside, someone being the big baby over there, the big old, it's raining outside, puppy, rain outside, right?"
"You know, Judge Patricia McCullough is saying showed a wholesale abandonment of common sense and an ignoring precedent."
"Is there a good tariff, a bad tariff?"
"Top Democrats including US President Joe Biden, former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as well as former First Ladies Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton are all expected to deliver speeches."
They would say he did something wrong.
"Send it to the big house, not the White House."
The demographic data is better for her in terms of issues.
Horsestrawn buggies from the Amish and motorcycle and Hell's Angels.
1.
And look no further than 2020.
"But as of now, the race remains neck and neck in the final few weeks of the campaign."
"And, you know, I think the world of Bryce, he's also got another pretty good LSU guy in there."
The polling shows that the race remains definitely still in a dead heat.
"President Trump is still ahead in Arizona, but that lead is narrow."
It really didn't manifest.
It's not some lighthearted thing.
"Shapiro, you want to get a coffee?"
Conservatives are jumping on this all over social media.
"And last week, the movement announced it won't endorse Kamala Harris, but they did urge supporters to vote against Trump and avoid third party candidates."
"I'll bring the Philly cheesesteaks next time, Kenneth."
Vote for Kamala Harris.
I wonder what the hell happens during that 45.
"They're like, dude, really for me?"
Every place she's touched has turned to fucking.
"But Trafalgar is bringing the numbers down with the plus two, obviously Trafalgar being sort of an obvious Republican pollster."
"I agree with you, brother."
Anything that's a hindrance right now is because of an executive branch that has failed to perform.
He's not focused on the future of trying to help the American people.
You're saying she should have to not wear her earrings?
So we got to get our base out.
So it's like this false narrative that's being pushed.
Let's get to the actual news clip here.
"She's an online conspiracy theorist who has described herself as, quote, a proud Islamophobe and, quote, pro-white nationalism."
"Amish f conservative, their quali everything to them."
"The early turnout is high, with many Pennsylvanians voting ahead of time thanks to increased mail-in ballot access and heightened political engagement."
The new Rasmussen poll has not been put in for Pennsylvania and Trump is still sitting plus 0.1.
"And now it's like, he's totally discombobulated over Kamala Harris being the Democratic nominee."
I get some water from the store or something like that.
Bye.
My race is tight because of two reasons.
The enemy from within are more dangerous than Russia.
I'm Jones Cink and welcome to the Streaming News Network.
"Nevada has trended nearly 5 points to the right since 2012, when Barack Obama carried it by 7 points over Mitt Romney."
I've now worked 15 minutes more than Kamala straight for honest headline at all the headlines.
He'll be heading to North Carolina as well later this week.
But it's a passion for country.
"You can't extrapolate from that according to these people, the gatekeepers of the election mafia, like the aforementioned 538."
"Ryan, you're a Republican."
It's a serious issue.
Probably not.
"If you're a Republican, you want it to be if it's plus one, Dem, that's good."
What does Trump say when he's there?
Make sure to add the blades to your cart.
How's school going?
I joked with her the other day when I saw her Pennsylvania.
The sample size is 1331.
"Instead of like trying to recruit candidates that are solid, that he could prop up from the beginning, that share all of his values, he typically just wants to endorse whoever he feels like can win the election and might align with him the most or said something nice to him in the past."
"On the one hand, incredible strength when it is intact, what it does for its people to protect and defend their rights, their liberty, their freedom."
So Vance being here right in the heart of Pittsburgh is a very significant stop and before that I was up north in Erie Pennsylvania.
"I can't imagine the American people are dumb enough to vote for Kamala Harris, by and large, number one."
"No, he don't be."
"That's Trump's base right there, right here."
"And he's had some success with that, such that the Harris team is now worried."
And so I think it's going to be incredibly close.
"I don't, I don't take, uh, you know, credit."
Whoever Harris does select as her number two could have an impact on this race.
And we got another tie.
"This is a specter that I think, you know, Mao's China, Stalin would have envied to have the ability to impose this clean economy through the massive organs of the state in which they're able to do it."
And it was $22.40.
"I want a VP pick that's secure enough to be second under a woman, is content to be VP, and won't undermine the president to maneuver his own election, and doesn't sweep sexual harassment under the rug."
"These areas have diverse populations, particularly black communities, immigrants and young voters who tend to lean towards progressive policies."
Trump said Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother.
"Joe D, I appreciate it."
But Trump is not backing down.
You can make the flip side of that argument.
This is not an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
"Bob Casey voted for that, right?"
And we make more money.
I know that she will work in good faith with Republicans in Congress to address a congressional legislative fix to our broken border and immigration system.
"So let's take Allegheny County, for example."
That is exactly true.
"Look, we'll see."
"If this keeps up, I'm not saying that's for sure going to happen."
Is anyone there?
This is not a plan to bring down prices.
So you and then the second part of this is we want and I think this is important.
"I don't think she's very likely to endorse Biden, but it's possible she never endorsed his Trump."
Her campaign is trying to appeal to rural Democrats to try to offset any gains Trump would make in those rural Republican heavy counties.
Everything looks very good for it.
"Well, look, I think the big first decision she had to make was to choose a running mate, choose a future governing partner in Governor Walz, which she did."
They have a lot of arrogance in their campaigning and their entire existence.
"They've also chosen to take leadership roles in Penn's Democratic group, juggling schoolwork with driving voter turnout, canvassing and meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris."
"You have the one outlier for Trump, which is Atlas Intel has Trump plus three."
Politicians who are willing to work with people on both sides of the aisle to get stuff done and that in this race is Kamala Harris.
The other pollsters fared worse ranging outside their margins of error between 4 and 6 points.
"So even in the extreme circumstances where race is Democrat plus 15, the Republican poll will show Democrats plus five."
And I think that's partly because Trump has tried to paint this as a politically motivated attack against them.
We have the alternative logo t-shirt.
And there's reason for that.
How long did it take for people in the crowd to realize what was happening?
Harris has also been preparing by holding mock debates.
"If the margin of error is often in Donald Trump benefits at the end of the day because of that, this is a viable result."
"I, as a pastor, have to remember that our country is a democracy."
"But Pennsylvania, the one with maybe just a little bit of a lead for the former president, that is critical because the former president would only need to take one of these states."
I think she's a weak leader so with Trump being President already and He can be a good leader for us and not only for the US but throughout the whole world.
The vice president is expected to name her running mate before she begins a barnstorming tour of battleground states on Tuesday.
So you could argue.
Subscribe now and stay ahead of the entertainment curve.
I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that guy never steps foot in the White House again and we're going to deliver a win for Vice President Harris in Pennsylvania.
I'm out of here in January anyway.
 Let's go and put this next piece up on the screen.
And I think that speaks to his lack of character.
"When announcing her running mate, she went to Philadelphia."
His children go to a Jewish day school.
"Kamala Harris talking about cutting childcare costs, right?"
" In a significant development for the 2024 election cycle, Donald Trump has recently secured a notable legal victory in Pennsylvania that could potentially alter the trajectory of the presidential race."
How do you think they're going to vote?
"And finding entertainment news, Sam Morelos plays Nikki Velasco in the Netflix sitcom That Nighty Show."
They destroyed evidence.
"I mean, good Lord."
And make sure you go to join NN dot com to find News Nation on your television provider.
"They're actually just doing this right now through massive cash infusion, Pennsylvania, of course, being the biggest state."
The battle for Pennsylvania is intensifying with each passing day.
It could even flip.
"But you know, I view inflation was the worst we've ever had."
"But she's not as well-known to most Americans, Jeff."
He's nearing 50 percent and then the Emerson poll trumps up by four in Pennsylvania in the Fox News poll.
"And Biden was like, I am?"
And drink something if you got it.
We're talking about Democrats and their operations.
Some people say that that was because you had a weak opponent.
When everyone else is showing Trump leads?
"What this is focused on, though, these efforts or this talk of the former president wanting to repeal this Act 77, this is an act that was passed in 2019, which was before the pandemic, that allowed for no excuse absentee voting, which means that anybody could vote by mail."
When you hear and I want to ask you something that she's kind of asking us all to do.
"So he's very clear that he's obviously going to try to steal the election again, just like he did last time."
PS5 pro.
Democrats need a firewall of about 390 votes to feel okay that they have a good enough shot of winning the state of Pennsylvania.
"So spending a lot of time there, Democrats are both the surrogates and and the candidates and I'm going to continue to do everything I can to help there."
"The more inflationary debt cycle, economic calamity with food shortages, rationing, limits on your transportation, vehicle limits, the more you're going to have calamity, the easier it is to impose this kind of centrally planned totalitarian vision."
That's why this is a big deal.
I think we ran a hell of a race.
"Well, I wouldn't say that if you're just talking about, I mean, maybe Pennsylvania, there might be a 0% chance."
Trump can use this legal victory to emphasize his commitment to election integrity and contrast it with Democratic positions.
And that's why President Biden and Vice President Harris have made investing in our nation's water infrastructure a cornerstone of this administration's agenda.
I know I don't think it was since 2016 that Republicans haven't won here in Pennsylvania a key swing state What do they have to do differently this time around to win?
"He then, after being taken to the ground, stood up, pumped his fists, says, USA, Make America Great Again."
"Think Arizona, Georgia."
He says I gave him lunch.
Rural and exurban areas.
And I've seen a division in our country that I don't think he's going to be able to unify.
"A new poll in Pennsylvania, a new poll of 600 potential voters in Pennsylvania conducted by Susquehanna polling and research places Harris ahead by four percentage points in the state."
"Republicans voted in support of passing this, and it was signed into law in 2019."
This is manipulation.
"The survey, executed by Fabrizio Lee and associates NGBAL and sponsored by the Wall Street Journal, involves 600 registered voters from the state."
They are waiting and watching what we're going to do.
How about some Yacht Rock?
So this visit is about reviving the Obama coalition from the past and trying to get some political electricity around Vice President Harris.
I'm not sure that Harris has that kind of instincts or experience to know where that is.
"Your job, which is a good job, an energy job."
John's interest lies in healthcare innovation and ensuring that new medical technologies are accessible to the public.
"Again, Trump's trying to show some solidarity with union workers."
"But once it's done, I would like to give this to President Trump as well, just to give him a show of gratitude."
"Last week, dozens of undergraduate students from various colleges in Pittsburgh gathered for a voter education event dubbed voting 101 with the pretty girls hosted by undergraduate members of AKA."
Will he count the votes for the Democratic candidate that won or will he not?
"In his analysis of the next election in 2024, Shapiro described it not only as a contest between two political parties, but more as a referendum on the continuation of democratic values."
"But I think what you really need to see on an economic message is something that speaks to the middle class, strengthens our union jobs and our unions in general."
I know you're in the house.
"And I've always been saying this, that Erie picks the winner of Pennsylvania, and then Pennsylvania picks the president."
"Doesn't mean you're going to be millionaires, but you will have a comfortable living if you, you know, work hard."
So these are really good numbers.
You're going to base your decision on that.
And I just really hope that we can do everything we can to make it a reality because we deserve this.
He should have stayed in.
I think we should just take a look at what happened there last night.
"Then the polls are close and the Republicans and the Democrats have spent a lot of time, money and energy in Pennsylvania trying to get the state to swing their way."
The Trump campaign of course had a field day with with that with those remarks there.
He doesn't.
"Be well, enjoy the rest of this Wednesday."
"It's like, wait, what?"
"So the best thing here that we have is being prepared, having a legal team ready, et cetera."
"It's sort of naturally what leads to inflation is that when the government spends more than it brings in, that's what causes inflation."
A lot of black males are not into the Harris campaign.
So we are basically doing a lot of the Democrat activities just to elect Republicans.
"The campaign can leverage the recent legal victory to galvanize support, mobilize voters, and build momentum heading into election day."
"So first of all, why did you, no, but hey, the Rambler, why did you wind up giving five minutes of your speech to how hot Kamala Harris is?"
That guy goes out and parrots Trump's bullshit every day.
She does have a good track record.
"And so these guys, they went at each other during this 60 minute debate, contentious and at times, Lindsey, personal."
"Friedman's $750,000 donation to Harris is driven by his support for technological advancements and cybersecurity, both of which Harris has championed."
The Hispanic vote likely does move to the right in the state of Pennsylvania.
It don't matter.
"And look, Erie's also had some economic challenges over the last several years."
"And therefore, they're looking for another alternative."
"The sixth poll was conducted between September 20th and 24th by Beacon Research, Shaw and Company Research among 775 likely voters."
 Anybody who's about beating down other people is a coward!
Harris matched him among voters 65 and older and saw support from white voters without a college degree rise to 41 percent from April.
And we got a picture of Trump out the window waving.
And let me tell you something.
It's not like he hasn't been spending any of his war chest either.
So I think she has to articulate that tonight.
Vote.
That's what he's looking for.
I'm just in college Trump is only up by two.
Have a good one.
"And of course, invest into other states, but mainly those two."
I think there's a lot of work to be done.
"Oh, sure."
And Harris rose to the top of the ticket.
The eleventh poll was conducted by morning consult between September 19th and 25 with 993 registered voters.
We then fixed the border.
"But just to be clear, did you have any conversations with him about that or did you consult in any way kind of as this process was playing out?"

It's anybody's game.
"At this point in time, he just needs Georgia."
And Pennsylvania's do not believe Kamala Harris will not come after fossil fuels.
Pennsylvania isn't just any state.
That gets Trump 277 to 261.
" Harris, mistrusted in PA, Keystone State."
We don't have an official ground game as of yet.
"But even, for example, R. Chris Krebs, who's a CBS News cyber security analyst, used to run CISA, which is the big cyber security agency, did it for the Trump administration, pointed out that there had been concerns about sort of hack and leak instances, where you might see someone hack into some kind of an email account or website and then start pushing out information, what he called malinformation."
These key democratic vote banks are appearing to gravitate towards Trump.
And yet you look at what Democrats have done with just their few years in power.
There's really no words.
A lot of the big issues for me were the fact that Kamala is a politician and the debate is a politician's game and I believe that she definitely has a better convincing point for who to vote for.
"Our votes are our voice, and that's how we can win."
That's why Pennsylvania is so crucial.
This isn't harmless.

He's a nearly 80 year old man.
"The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide-ranging 21-minute long segment."

"If these were in fact gunshots, are there concerned about everybody's safety as people are now moving in aimless directions, bumping into each other, bumping into tossed equipment?"
And Donald Trump also hit the trail in the state with a town hall outside Philadelphia.
58% say disapprove.
"So is this move toward Jill Stein, is that a political strategy?"
Trump on through social is calling on voters here to get out and vote saying quote if you have a ballot return it immediately and if not go vote at the polls right now.

"And if you're pro-FBA, and if you're not pro-majority in this country, you're not going to go far in the Democratic party at all."

"She is definitely, she's had four years to do it."
Does that mean it's going to trend fifteen points Republican?
They weren't affected by COVID because they don't watch TV and it's just a really amazing man.
"We ask folks, do you have a positive or negative impression of Trump and Harris?"
"They've been there Prominent family A guy like Trump's little weasel A little bald head weasel guy, I can't remember his name right now But he is related to a prominent family from my hometown And they absolutely flipped it The poorest city in Pennsylvania With Republican economics and Trumpism So what I'm telling you is that Pennsylvania has been hard flipped It's conservative And a woman with Kamala Harris's background is not going to be able to flip Pennsylvania back And the only thing that Donald Trump needs in order to win the 2024 election out of the six swing states Is Pennsylvania Okay, I'm sounding this alarm because I feel like the guy on the Titanic who saw the iceberg ahead And said, hey, hey iceberg Y'all see that iceberg out there?"
"I'm not gagging because the state of the world has rendered me just ungaggable at this point, but a single sip of McDonald's Sprite, an Altoid, one Altoid, a whiff of Fireball whiskey, a swig of green Listerine, a flight of stairs up or down, 15 minutes, 10 minutes standing on a sidewalk in Las Vegas this week."
"In the third poll, conducted by Redfield and Wilton Strategies, from August 12 to 15, with 825 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 44%."

"First of all, all the money that's coming in from the West Coast and places other than Pennsylvania being used in this district against me, that's number one."
Let's give him Georgia.
"So again, you know, we're seeing some changes from last time around, but it's not yet clear how this is going to break down, even though some of these percentages are much bigger than four years ago."
"Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz have begun a week-long media blitz where they will be interacting with media organizations and social media influencers across the country."
 I didn't even flinch.
"You know, remember with the purple background, the pink and purple."
I mean Parnell would have been far better than Oz.
"And so whether you harken back to the Donald Trump future, because he would say that's what he's delivering in the future or to a different vision of the future from Kamala Harris, I think both these candidates will need to tie that into their message this evening."
"The seventh poll was conducted between September 20th and 24 by Beacon Research, Shaw and Company Research among 1,021 registered voters."
"Joining us right now is CNN senior political analyst and senior editor with the Atlantic, Ron Brownstein, it's good to see you, Ron."
We're not going to see these crazy swings like where Trump almost won the electoral college while losing the popular vote by four points.
And that's kind of what we see here.
The same is true for immigration.
This is like how normal people talk.
"For example, he'll say, well, she said, I'm going to ban fracking."
"I mean, they are looking at numbers that show them in a really, really strong position, a really, really strong position against Donald Trump, in contrast with what we had seen previously."
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision to uphold the requirements for mail-in ballots reinforces the Republican stance on election integrity and provides a boost to Trump's campaign as it prepares for the final stages of the race.
It's saying right now about 10 shots were fired.
So they're just going to do token crap.
"Factors influencing voter sentiment in Pennsylvania include economic concerns, healthcare access, and social issues."
I do think that people do get frustrated with Donald Trump because of his own personal grievances.
"And some of that money has gone out the door already, Lana."
You go to other parts and the Harris signs are up.
This Republican pollster tells us what we've known for a while.
We appreciate it.
"Most of all, most of all, Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them, between the, quote, real Americans, which, by which he means his supporters, and the outsiders who don't support him."
"For Trump, freedom is getting away with stuff."
"Ryan, what do you think they need to hear on Tuesday, that undecided voter?"
So we know Harris is also kicking off her own battleground blitz.
Not on your mind at all.
We understand that ultimately you have a binary choice come this November.
"In contrast, Trump talked about his policy vision with a Time reporter for 90 minutes across two interviews."
Get Donald Trump on there.
"I mean, the guy gets so high off cocaine, he smokes Parmesan cheese, but still, it doesn't matter."
So I don't know what she's going off on about.
"First Post decodes the U.S. election, explains how America chooses its president."
Donald Trump has pushed us to the point where we can't even agree on the weather.
For the Hill Emerson last time we saw that Harris had gained 2 points over where President Biden had stood and found the race in late August tied at 48.
Amish f of this election?
So you could see Kamala Harris kind of barely hanging on with like this point seven point eight lead.
"We met Eric Daring, who mentioned those two key issues."
"Because he's been a president for what, three years?"
"Trump yells, fight, fight, fight."
"It's about helping people not just get by, but get ahead, making sure that there's a conversation around housing policy and building more housing and making sure that the issues that resonate with all voters are the issues that they talk about with our voters here in Allentown."
It's not going to win talking about whether she's dumb.
You already need a supplemental one.
It's called demographics Y'all see that iceberg?
But I don't think they're the problem in terms of election day.
 Pennsylvania's latest poll results are pretty shocking.
We've seen it when we did it in the first year of our administration.
"I want to ask you about your the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, because I just think so many eyes are on that state."
There were some awesome people there in her stay.
And the article kind of hints that this might not just be a Philly thing.
"Edwards explained that a longtime female friend in Omaha, who is featured in the picture, shared the image with him."
"But seriously, I mean, I'm interested in this because I mean, I don't even know how many dozens, hundreds of campaign events I have covered in my career."

"Biden took the state, so Harris absolutely can take the state too."
"It was local I've been wanting to see Trump I voted for Trump the first time around and second time around And I want to see him in office this time around what in particular about Trump made you want to vote for him three times now Well, he his values align with my values if you can see my hat."
"We have to talk about the 2024 presidential election, because it appears that Kamala Harris is in deep trouble in the key swing state of Pennsylvania."
The election is fundamentally done.
"You know, this guy, he'll never get anywhere."
"So we're at the DNC right now, as you can tell, right?"
They are the definition of die-hard Trump supporters.
"Others just hit the deck, got into the grass."
What were your thoughts?
"Yeah, Lindsay, she's going to have some policies coming out that will really focus on black entrepreneurship and careers, things like loans for black entrepreneurs who want to start new businesses and things like new pathways to have more black teachers in schools."
And so wouldn't you want to give them no excuses by making the election process?
I don't always put the full quote in an article.
Why is that important?
So the election fever gains momentum.
"OK, you told me something in the break, Amy."
But we've got to fight like the Democrats do in order to win.
"It seems as if like Barnett and Gale might be the better candidates, but neither of them really have that much of a chance in the primary."
"So for new listeners, whether they're in Key West or any of my other news stations, Selena wrote a book eight years ago that called it called The Great Revolt."
I think if we really start to look at how we really have a lot more in common and we all really want the same goal.
Without question.

"Several miles away in Northampton County, Republicans too are gathering for voter outreach."
"Generally speaking, conspiracy theories tend to form, are more likely to form for big, frightening, dangerous events than smaller events."
This level of frustration and finger pointing is not normal.
And that's the very first political Amish buggy parade ever in history.
It's all on Pennsylvania.
These are the fake news.
And we do hear him walk on that message a little bit sometimes.
Every poll is showing a three to 10 point shift in Pennsylvania for Trump with the majority of them short of four to five point shift.
It's it's really it's about the choice It's not about the money or it's about policies or those kinds of obscure things It's it's about the choice and what kind of a direction do we want our nation to go in and after all those things?
Pause.
Then they want to support family farmers and quote help ensure future generations of American farmers can thrive by helping beginning farmers get more access to credit and connecting them with all sorts of training and technical assistance.

Local stops.
"So that means compared to 2022 Republicans have already requested more mail-in ballots than the entirety of 2022 in Pennsylvania while Democrats they haven't they're going to obviously but Republicans already cracked 300,000."
The campaigns themselves basically have a different strategy.
This poll resulted in an exact tie.
"Well, see, it's weird."
And maybe that would allow this to go through.
It should be killed.
"Thank you, Pittsburgh."
Here's Governor Walz again.
Better than I have in a while.
The thing is that it's really gonna matter everyone's vote.
"Some of these places in Montgomery, she'll hold the margin."

Back to our friends at the rundown.
"Yeah, I'm still 50-50 on the debate."
This race is different.
"And as I've always said, liberals, progressives, independents, mainstream conservatives, mainstream Republicans, let's all come together, reject this Trumpism, reject this maggot madness."

"Always good to be with you, John."
And I still think there could be some more correction because it's not like the polls are ridiculously outrageous like they were with Trump and Biden to where Trump was leading every state by like five or six points.
"But this also comes as our CBS News polling from this weekend shows that the script has been flipped in the last couple weeks since the last debate that Donald Trump is now seen as in the red, no pun intended, on having a weakness among voters about who voters see as the most competent and able-bodied to be president."
Which is I mean just obviously completely the opposite of Trump's campaign.
"It's actually attributed to a stop, but it's obviously something that both candidates are focused on nationally as part of their major strategy."
You just.
"But he looked at them and said perfecto, which, of course, like melt any mother's heart."
And we see them showing up and voting that way.
"I think this goes to the question, though."
It does look like it's truly an effort just to win over this one segment of voters.
Well today in these blue wall states Vice President Harris is really going after that narrow sliver of those undecided voters specifically suburban women those more moderate Republicans and independents they're really hoping that former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney is going to make a dent with some of those voters who may be unsure about Vice President Kamala Harris but are also frustrated and tired of Donald Trump and Harris's message to them is that they've got a home within the Democratic Party and Liz Cheney is making the pitch that it's because she's deeply conservative that she's backing Harris she says she's putting the Constitution over her party calling Donald Trump unchecked unstable and dangerous.
"So the fact that Harris has at best a very small lead in Pennsylvania, the fact is those undecideds, they're going to break for Trump."
"And folks know that Vice President Harris has been part of administrations, been standing up for working people and standing up for folks' freedom."
We see the customers coming in to buy them.
His commitment highlights the power of sports in American culture.
"Hugh Hewitt used to say, if it's not close, they can't cheat."
It's been central a bunch of people.
This is Kotel and let's talk some politics.
I think that's why it's what does Trump use?

"And I mean, the surprise on your face, it was it was a shock, but it was also it looked like enjoyment as well."
And they'll scrutinize the hell out of polls that don't look good for them.

Donald Trump has been convicted of a felony.
Democrats are only slated to spend 40 million dollars.
"You know, not having just me, I think you're having everybody in Pennsylvania is here."

"Yeah, they had a head start in early voting, just the simple fact that Allegheny, Philly, Chester, the Democrat parts of Pennsylvania, they started voting earlier."
I Personally spoke with him.
"Sources say Trump meanwhile has had less formal debate prep, though he has been getting some help from Florida Congressman Matt Gates and also former Democratic Congressman Tulsi Gabbard."
"Even though wages are steadily growing, even though inflation is finally slowing, the price of everything from health care to housing to groceries, it's still too high and it hurts."
You've really got to dig deep when you're talking about that situation with NATO involved in everything like that in the United States should not be in NATO.
"I think Americans are just so sick of the anger and the despair and the hatred and the disunification, the other ring of others, the other ring of others, the other ring of the other."
"Yeah, and the economy is something that has been the top issue throughout this campaign There's a lot of frustration still from a lot of voters about inflation Even though some of those numbers have come down more recently."
 It continues live from New York City on a Friday afternoon.
"Which is to suggest, which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down."
"He was born there, North Carolina, in 2009."
I don't think that's good news for Harris.
The only thing that would give you pause is the people that Trump picks are always really weak and he's a lot stronger than them.
He should be condemning this.
There was a very narrow majority in the Minnesota Senate that allowed them to do this.
Yeah he looks stressed.
We know that she's going to be obviously traveling today.
"This is no shade to that creator, but the creator spoke about polls and I'm a professional pollster and some of what the creator said was not true and I just want to address it."
"To the victor go the spoils really is the state of play in Pennsylvania, Terry Moran, our thanks to you as always."
Like he could just really drive out the support in these red counties in Pennsylvania.
I don't think it's enough for Harris to win Pennsylvania.
It's the content or the statements being made in the middle of those rambling sessions.
They can mobilize tens of thousands of voters.
It sounds like he got a little fed up with taking questions and went with an unorthodox way of getting around taking questions.
And I can tell you tangibly that we are out registering the Democrats in terms of mail-in ballots in Mifflin County and Amish County in the center of the state and Juniata County and Amish County in the center of the state.
We've seen the manufacturing construction boom.
"He's showing strength there with white working class voters, with older voters, with black men, with the Hispanics suburbs around Philly."
Likely voters now see little daylight in most cases between Harris and Trump on who can best handle those key issues.
"We first met the duo, both of Dominican descent, before former President Trump survived an assassination attempt and pig JD Vance as his running mate."
"The demographics of Philadelphia County reveal a robust base of support for democratic candidates, making it imperative for any democratic hopeful, including Harris, to galvanize this urban electorate."
"For Democrats, maintaining their coalition of urban voters and winning back suburban voters who swung Republican in 2016 is essential."
"But how does the campaign, the Biden campaign and its surrogates, Democrats, how do they intend to capitalize on this and drawing this contrast?"
"Now, Nate Silver, formerly known as Nate Plastic, he's making a lot of sense lately."
"You know, everybody knows who he is."
The man should write a parenting book.
"If you believe, and I'm not coming to Joe Biden's defense at all."
I'm invincible.
"And when you talk about that white working class vote, Harris just dropping, you know, two, three points, you know, Trump making up some ground just because Joe Biden was a better fit for those voters than somebody like a Kamala Harris."
"Yeah, I also think I think economy."
The poll before that they had Biden up by seven.
"They got their piece of the American dream in terms of this democratic politician in my hometown Jack Mirtha providing benefits, providing jobs, providing opportunities to black men, etc So that's the basis of the environment, right?"
So I'll see you guys in the next one.
We appreciate you being on.
Good to have that context there.
"You're just mad whenever you lose, even though Mark Zuckerberg admitted in a letter to Jim Jordan that, yeah, I mean, I mean that letter is earth shattering."
Jess finished up with JD Vance who was in Pittsburgh just now in the city.
I Believe it's good not only for the economy.
"I honestly say it a few different ways, too, Connell."
"So it's hard to attribute to one factor and other specific stop, but certainly that's why those campaigns are going there so much, it's going to be a key state."
"That's what we do over here on this channel So uh, subscribe hit the comments and i'll catch you guys on the next one."
"Like some voters, yeah, but outside of, you know, place like Butler, he did, in fact, even worse than Clinton did in places like Lawrence and Clarion."
"If you have a summer home, uh, in Delaware and another house in the suburbs of Pennsylvania, I mean, come on."
" We want to turn now to young voters, Gen Z and millennials heavily courted by both campaigns."
Let's go win.
"I'm not a doctor, but..."
"Well, 2016, during that campaign, he mocked a disabled person."
These like the biting years.
"And for me, running for Dearborn, for mayor of Dearborn, was about the opportunity to improve the quality of life for all of our residents."
"And look, even though your grocery prices are improving, gas is going down slowly."
We got this massive surge.
"While Kamala Harris enjoys a steady support on several fronts, when it comes to key issues like immigration and economy, several polls have shown that the voters are leaning towards Donald Trump as the preferred president to deal with these issues."
"We have an amazing ticket with Vice President Kamala Harris at the top with Governor Tim Walz who are two people who understand the struggle of the everyday American, the working class and will fight for them when they're elected in November."
And I purposely convened them.
"If we have to go with another four years of these people, these people, and she's worse, and she's worse than Biden, in my opinion."
And I think that's really the folks that this campaign in Arizona will be wanting to do.
Sounds fantastic.
"Moore also stressed the importance of focusing on critical issues like affordable housing and climate change, and he warned that Harris's campaign should be cautious about being linked to unpopular policies of President Biden, particularly his support for the war in Gaza."
So here we have Trump at plus three in Arizona.
"At Shetley Quad, the heart of the University of Pittsburgh's campus, a plot displays each of the Divine Nine's seals and founder's names."
We saw for ourselves at a ballot intake center in Chester County outside Philadelphia.
"And then on election night, you'd be counting the ballots as they're coming in."
But Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote by two points and lost.
"She is me, and I am her."
But the only reason it's not like a Trump plus one lead is because of the Suffolk poll for those that don't know Suffolk University is one of the worst pollsters out there.
But what I've seen over the last four or five weeks with Kamala Harris is just extraordinary energy.
"Okay, Grandma, do you wanna vote for the first black woman president ever?"
And I say was because earlier this summer he decided to write an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer endorsing Kamala Harris as a local GOP leader.
And both Barry and Dan are joining us live from there with more on what the voters had to say.
"As inflation and interest rates are coming down and the stock market hitting another all time record high today, the Dow up 200 points closing for the first time above 43,000."
They're going to be covering that building that Thomas Crooks was able to get up on.
"And you have a shot, I'm told, at Scott Perry and Harrisburg and York."
"Did God protect Buffalo, New York?"
"I mean, I am the hopey changey guy."
"Obviously, you know, this is somebody who is doing that more during the time."
That all tells you the same thing.
"They can't force the market to, they can't keep the market from eventually being right."
"In 2016, the Democrats had an advantage of nearly 1 million more Ds than ours."
What else could Trump do?
Like a civil war to me involves black people.
"All right, let's just increase to the college student a little bit."
"However, I have just seen Kamala's report and it's not good."
"In this scenario, you've won."
"I mean, just take a look right here in Delaware County, for example, and this is Delaware County mail ballots."
"And Perry, Trump has been taking some heat, of course, for comments that he made this week about the Presidential Medal of Freedom."
"I've seen you top the charts with your music and you do music on top of everything, on top of your reporting."
"The states joined battleground Wisconsin, Michigan, and the all-important Pennsylvania as the six toss-up states in the Cook Political Report ratings."
"He is, however, Jewish."
"Remember when Biden used, I used to love this guy because you were on pins and needles watching him speak."
I'd rather listen to someone that's actually gonna do something for this country.
I Hope so.
But the thing about these places is they're also the kinds of voters where Donald Trump would hope to cut into some of those margins.
And I know the Biden campaign makes it seem like North Carolina is in play.
Vice President Harris remarked on stage today that she would be pretty surprised in any other election year to have this group show up on stage with her in the closing lap of a presidential campaign.
"Because leading up to the first presidential debate, I will admit, I had Joe Biden starting to do better because he was rebounding in the polls, starting to see improvements in battleground states."
"So tonight, I think at this town hall in Cumming, Georgia, I think the women there are hoping to hear more answers from the former president."
"And the reason why that matters is because, sure, Biden and Harris were never going to win Ohio."
We do not have a negative opinion of them at all.
That I'm not sure of and we're going to have to wait and see on election day.
Maybe so we're gonna exclude those so we can show you just all cherry picking.
"People don't love Dr. Oz, although he does in polling have a decent chunk of the vote."
"In other words, we're doing so bad in Pennsylvania, we can't even pick Josh Shapiro to save us."
"Yeah, I mean, because we were there on Thursday, word spread like wildfire that Biden might drop out, right?"
"Mark, Momma Kamala wants to ban fracking."
So when you look at the Harris campaign they've taken so many different stops in rural deep red areas of Pennsylvania that from an outsider perspective you're thinking why are they spending their time.
"To date, Harris has yet to hold a formal press conference, raising further concerns about transparency and accessibility as the campaign heats up."
But then ABC Ipsos has Harris plus four.
I see what kind of stuff you're on Nikki Haley.
The Trump campaign's success in Pennsylvania is also indicative of a broader trend in the 2024 election cycle.
Biden can't sink.
"And he was this big horrible person who killed, I mean, they said he killed millions."
"Okay, let's do a couple of questions."
But it's you and the evidence of the energy and the passion of the American people.
"Because Donald Trump, John Federman is right."
"Look, I think it's more of the same from Donald Trump, someone who doesn't show the kind of respect to the military that our men and women in uniform deserve."
It's easy to imagine that a strong Republican candidate could have beaten Federman in a race that may well determine control in the Senate.
"The stakes are incredibly high, and the outcome will have a profound impact on the future of the country, influencing policies and the direction of the nation."
"Pennsylvania has long been a political bellwether in presidential elections, with its diverse electorate making it a crucial state for both parties."
"Look, Democrats aren't held accountable for anything they say or do."
So good luck to all those involved.
I don't think there was one poll back in 2016.
"Campaign focus and strata, Harris has been making numerous trips to Pennsylvania, emphasizing a broader strategy that goes beyond traditional Democratic strongholds."
"There might have been a couple, like one or two, but yeah, there was two polls out of Pennsylvania or actually just one in the final month of the election that had Trump winning Pennsylvania."
And they're eating cats.
And then you've also got this going on at the same time on the same day.
You got media members all around and then he comes over with the hundred dollar bill.
The reality for both candidates in battleground states is they have to fight and fight every day.
"They only need one seat if Donald Trump wins the White House, two seats if Kamala Harris wins."
"Now, the city of Philadelphia has become slightly more Republican."
So one third of every voter is under the age of 45.
"This shift was evident in the 2018 midterms, when several Republican-held congressional seats in the Philadelphia suburbs flipped to the Democrats."
"And then came another point where flank Franklin and Marshall College, which again is the in state in house pollster in Pennsylvania, one of the best pollsters in the state, showing Kamala Harris with a three point advantage."
But really your AIPAC is going to be the one telling us who the good Democrats are.
"And that means no blade movement, more comfort before and after shaving."
Or are you rooting for Trump?
So let's get right into it First of all Trump leads by point five.
They are not in this country illegally.
Like her changing her position on fracking.
You need to be screened to enter this area.
This is on Tuesday.
Says you're fired and then it's like on the barrel of the gun.
I'm hearing that things don't change that drastically.
"Mr. Wallace is gonna be fantastic too, so we're just over the moon."
We most certainly still feel that way.
But what if that isn't the case?
The bad news is he endorsed Dr. Oz.
"But in the grand scheme of things, this could be one of the most defining moments for the Kamala Harris campaign and the Donald Trump campaign."
"He's caught, by the way, I hate to say it, he reminds me of myself in these situations because that's the way I would handle it."
And together we'll keep building a country that's more fair and more equal and more just and more free.
"Because this election, it's not just about picking a president."
And then the Washington Post came out with a poll in the same day that said they were tied in Pennsylvania.
That's not to say that Trump didn't win a lot of those voters or hold a lot of those voters from 2020 because he absolutely did.
Voter fraud is widespread.
"I still think that there is a pathway for Harris, but in the last couple of days, it seems like there has been more data to suggest, uh, yeah, Trump's probably gonna win Pennsylvania."
And so that can give Pennsylvania added attention.
It's really 50 50.
That's what a lot of people like about her.
He's not afraid to talk issues and just tell it like it is.
"But that being said, there was the the idea was like regardless of where you put the filibuster, like they reduced the filibuster, you know, from 66 to 60, I think during that era, regardless of where you put the filibuster, a guy like Lieberman is going to put himself as the 59th or 60th vote."
So it's a party ID.
Of course not.
And I think that's school indoctrination.
But this is what we're going to go ahead and do.
"Quite the spectacle, as always, from the former president."
Mark my words.
JD is great.
Donald Trump calling Kamala Harris not a smart woman.
Sure.
Why is he traveling to central Pennsylvania?
They call it occupied.
"He's got deep, deep roots in the Pennsylvania community."
Trying to process that.
Go to a factory in France?
He said she went from being one of the worst vice presidents in history to Margaret Thatcher.
We're going to raise a little bit of money for you and in return you're going to tow the line.
I just came out on top here.
" Hi, thank you for joining us."
That's not what that means.
"I have iPhone bootstraps, Venezuela 100 billion dead."
"And he's doing all he can to avoid a hostage deal, to bring all the hostages and prisoners home and to allow unfettered access to humanitarian aid."
"I can't remember the exact word they used, but it lasted a little too long."
My name is Tricia Amish and register them.
"Okay, let's see what's going on."
She really has the nuts to send billions of dollars of our tax dollars overseas.
"But also having a difficult time with African American folks, with black men in particular."
"Or I mean, we're still a little less than two months out."
It's hard to say for sure.
It's a garbage pollster.
"Our latest DDHQ and the Hill polling average for today, it has Harris leading with 48.7% and Trump with 48%."
But do you find it just a little bit odd that it's every poll finding the shift every single one?
Yeah a new way forward.
The historic coalition might prove to be a powerful voting and mobilization bloc.
So definitely 46% of the economy is good and excellent.
"All those politicians that run and pretend to be something else, they think they're better than you."
It could really improve his chances and it's all about getting the vote out.
"And so far, it is indeed bouncing off."
These are the steel stacks.
"But I think this is reflective of as we actually get closer to Election Day, people are starting to pay attention."
"They should be at roughly a million requests right now, but they're not Republicans at the bare minimum."
"Understanding this context is critical for any candidate aiming to connect with voters across the spectrum, particularly in regions that have experienced economic hardships."
But why did she go back?
The one debate they had was in Philadelphia.
"So let's go over the numbers for a second, Meghan."
"Pennsylvania is always a swing state, but it feels like the whole election could hinge on it this time around."
He wasn't going to pick no Negro.
"You're about to get on a bus tour of the Blue Wall states, including your own home state of Pennsylvania."
Kamala Harris faces a unique challenge.
"There are some moments that are going viral, but this right here is getting a lot of play."
"A word on polling errors, the best two pollsters are Susquehanna and Rasmussen for the state of PA, at least for the ones I looked at here."
Amazing.
So let's go to Susquehanna.
Go out and make sure those firefighters know you got their back.
Aquafina plays that unsuspecting winner.
"The ninth poll was conducted between September 20 and 24 by Beacon Research, Shaw and Company Research among 1,021 registered voters."
"Trump addressed the incident directly, expressing gratitude for his survival and his ability to continue speaking to his supporters, emphasizing the importance of resilience and determination in the face of adversity."
"I grew up in a coal mining community not far from here and it's sad to see the state of a lot of those places but with the oil and gas they established a new tax structure in Pennsylvania to where a lot of the money is diverted back to the local communities, the counties."
"Looking back, I regret that vote."
And so they just kind of tear everybody on our side down instead of lifting people up.
You're going to vote.
"But no, it's a great family."
"Kamala Harris was also asked, this is a short clip, but Kamala Harris is also asked if she is ready to debate Donald Trump."
Others as well addressed so many stuff.
"If I'm Kamala Harris, I want to be up in the polling average by four to five points."
"In November of 2020, Democrats had a 685,000 voter registration advantage in Pennsylvania."
They thought it was too harsh.
He is also very pro-Israel.
Please support the channel.
"I mean, he was born in Pennsylvania."
"And Republicans avoided disaster in Ohio's sixth district, but it was closer than it should have been."
So that's a big shift there in terms of moving those numbers around.
Is Trump and the Republican party at-largest rapid gains among minority voters?
But we have another song coming out in hopefully a month that is a tongue in cheek song about these political elites who believe they're the smartest and the best and they're better than you.
"Yes, they had to relocate for a period, and we had security around the clock for many months."
Who are you?
"All right, let's keep going down here."
And they thought they'd already want.
"I'll tell you what, how about if we gave you some French fries?"
We lost all these jobs.
The state leaned towards the Republicans under Donald Trump in 2016.
He votes Pennsylvania values in the United States Senate.
"They've had a couple of good weeks, but how do they continue to maintain this energy, particularly in a state like Pennsylvania, where your governor, Josh Shapiro, was passed over as the running mate."
Even Harris plus five.
And my opponent has not shown the courage to stand up and to condemn.
This is why she came out after the election when she lost and she never really got over that or admitted it by the way.
And I know a lot of Republicans were a little worried because Donald Trump wasn't having a whole lot of fun in September.
But we have to adapt our strategy and fight with the political rules on the battlefield as they are today.
"He'd say build the wall, lock her up, etc."
Maybe she's wrong.
"So Libby, let's talk about Donald Trump."
"As the Democratic National Convention approaches, Harris's upcoming speech is anticipated to further boost her campaign, setting the stage for a crucial period leading up to the presidential debate and the start of early voting."
And America is not having enough.
"Right now, there is a pending court case, and we are hopeful that the judge listening will require the State Election Board to actually follow the law."
"Hey, I'll be the first to say, do I think the border's been handled that great the last three years?"
"There's two in Pennsylvania that went twice for Obama, then went for Trump, and then Biden got him back."
Donald Trump was just a good president and he's the best president of my lifetime.
So the electorate looks much more Republican than even 2020 and much more than 2022.
Think like the Harrisburg area.
"All right, that's fun."
"But without further ado, let's go ahead and roll it."
"With favorable polling data in key battleground states and a strong legal foundation, Trump's campaign is positioned to make a significant impact on the outcome of the election."
"It was a tree, all trees."
"Y'all see it definitely prayers to Trump always, you know prayers to Trump What are you going through?"
And then they come up with rules and regulation to go to all electric.
All labor.
"We're much better prepared today, four years later, than we were."
"If you're about my age, you are not getting social security."
"There has been a shift recently, though."
The bets are programmed into a smart contract on the polygon blockchain.
"That's incredibly close after almost six million some, or more than six million votes that were cast in the election."
"Jim, thank you very much for being with me this morning."
"Now with Pennsylvania in place, she's trying to backpedal."
So I had to come to Butler.
"Unlike in polls, polymarket punters trade on Olympic women's boxing controversy."
"Well, we don't know there Biden's local ties and cultural roots left him to victory in 2020 here But obviously as Democrats battle for the state Kamala Harris is their nominee, you know, she's not a Catholic man she is a California woman of color who is spearheaded post-dab as a porcelain messaging So she's an awkward fit political rights for the state of Pennsylvania, you know have a hard-pressed working-class region That's historically been a locus of anti-abortion activity So I don't know if every like if a majority of voters are actually anti-abortion but again, it's She does remind the voters there of She doesn't Biden reminded them of the older Democrats more focused on economic messages then Kamala who's focused more on abortion and democracy and other stuff like that and Obviously they say here Biden's discomfort we're talking about abortion may have been a Swiss spot modern for the Democrats but Paris by contrast like It's you know For voters that like Northeastern is Pennsylvania Catholics."
"That's 270, and he has taken a lead in the aggregate."
"Yeah, I'll be looking forward to seeing how that interaction, if there is one, between the governor and the former president, happens."
He's at 50 percent and Kamala Harris is down there at 47 percent.
"Like, we're talking about a presidential election, guys."
If polly market shows Kamala Harris is losing.
"And that here, you can sense that as well."
"Like it'll, it's going to happen no matter who, like really from the, no matter a Democrat or Republican at this point, like it's going to happen."
He delivered for them in his first term.
"New York Times interviewed some local supporters who were really energized, inspired by, you know, his reaction in that moment and decided, you know, not only am I gonna vote for him, I'm gonna volunteer, I'm gonna be a like precinct captain or whatever."
"And in fact, I was the tiebreaking vote on the inflation reduction act, which opened new leases for fracking."
They still found Trump with a sizable lead in Pennsylvania.
This came on Sunday.
"William Thompson â€“ $10 million William Thompson, an influential figure in Pennsylvania's finance sector, has donated $10 million to Harris' campaign."
It's a little bit tough.
You've campaigned across Pennsylvania and you've gone to places like Somerset County where Donald Trump won by 56 points four years ago.
Probably two or is that everybody?
"Meanwhile, back on the campaign trail, a local Pennsylvania journalist has raised concerns about the accessibility of Governor Walz to the press during a campaign event in Lancaster County on Wednesday."
"In the 2024 race, Pennsylvania once again becomes the focus of campaigns, as both sides understand that winning this state will have a significant impact on the final result."
These guys don't get any.
I want to get a little bit more of a sense of Harris's message for Michigan voters because we know that both Harris and Trump have spent a lot of time there in Michigan.
Watch this.
So the fact that the Kamala Harris team is on the ground in Georgia speaks volumes about where they think they've got some opportunities here.
You win the election.
"First off, I love Tom Hagan."
Look at this man.
"And when you see polls that have them up, it's a good sign."
"Now, one of the things that Harris campaign is learning is that in 2016, this was a complete blind spot for Hillary Clinton's campaign."
"Well, there's a lot of trash candidates in this race."
But he's winning Hispanic 62 percent to 36 percent.
You mentioned he's won everyone pretty widely.
"Most of all, most of all, Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them, between the, quote, real Americans, by which he means his supporters, and the outsiders who don't support him."
And I think they know there are good chances that other defendants are coming forward.
"So as always, guys, thanks for watching."
They didn't have anything.
You get the idea of what's going on.
"And just days after Ms. Harris moved to the top of the presidential ticket this summer, every divine nine president pledged in a joint statement to meet this critical moment in history with an unprecedented voter registration, education, and mobilization coordinated campaign."
And so it looked like Donald Trump was unbeatable that this election would be one and done.
Pennsylvania is the ballgame.
What does this one show?
It's a more making it more personal and just like the attacks seem to be a negative thing.
We're going to take it back in November and it's going to get done.
"Samuel Lin â€“ $4 million Samuel Lin, an investment guru from Philadelphia, has donated $4 million to Harris' campaign."
He said Democrats complaints a reflection of their anxiety over a tight race.
How do you even know what to believe anymore?
I'm a data guy.
"What, it bankrupted the country?"
And people had thought that I'd lost my mind.
This ain't nothing but a white liberal.
"With each region bringing its own set of priorities and concerns to the table, Pennsylvania's strong labor union presence, particularly in the manufacturing sector, has historically leaned democratic."
"But I think at the end of the day, whatever the polls say on election day is gonna be your biggest guide."
So that is something that has been shown to be a particular interest within that community.
Huh.
Was known any Amish people?
And so then the following days as I mentioned we're going to Wisconsin we're going to go see some dairy farmers in Wisconsin they feel a little left behind.
"So watch for, not just in those remarks at the podium, that the President will kick off and then the other remarks of the other speakers, but also watch from what you hear from folks down here on the floor about party unity, about how they feel they have coalesced, a lot of Democrats say, around Harris, obviously, hurtling towards November."
"That said, we can win anyway by understanding what their intention is and doing our best to overwhelm the polls with our presence."
"Now, you talk about reaching out to voters."
Y'all know how I feel about this.
The the the donors to this super pack want the Republican agenda.
"If you like what you heard, please comment, rate, share and subscribe."
"Okay, will you deliver a message to your teacher?"
Trump can use the ruling to emphasize that his campaign is fighting for the principles he has championed throughout his political career.
And now Kamala Harris is losing on the nuclear politics average by just 0.2% nationwide.
So we have a equal opportunity in this America in this country So that's a good thing for us.
And that is something that is viable.
"I was with a group of people, like sort of nice people."
At least they'll give her some consideration.
"And again, I'm getting phone calls from close immediate family members saying they're trapped or they have been killed or they have been injured."
But the truth is that people are feeling the pinch.
But that's the problem here.
"And in particular, they look at Michigan, which is another state state that's going to be key in the race."
"And as I see here, look at this man."
I talked to someone who studies conspiracy theory today about when these kinds of things can take hold.
"You throw everything at Georgia, but even then it's not enough."
"Even in that scenario, Harris has a much smaller lead in Pennsylvania than Biden did, that Clinton did."
Now this is of no surprise because I've been following Kamala and her national political aspirations for a while.
Their combined presence in Pennsylvania underscores the Democratic Party's commitment to reaching out to voters in key states.
Despite what Democrats may claim about the current state of the race and how Harris is actually up by 50 points.
This is a renaissance painting.
We've had a historic pandemic that wrecked havoc on communities and businesses.
"It's only one point lead, but it's another pollster that's not bad."
But now it's still a Trump lead.
"These measures include the initiative launched by the administration of Vice President Joe Biden to regulate the price of insulin and other drugs that save lives, to put an end to jump fees at banks, and to regain the 800,000 manufacturing jobs that were lost during previous economic downturns."
"But the one place where you had somewhat okay turnout, I guess you would say, it's about where half the district was."
Where you already had a lot of Democrats switched to voting in person.
"Ohio has long been considered a bellwether state in presidential elections, often reflecting the national mood."
"Signing me now, my friend Mark Moreno, executive editor, climatedepot.com."
They're down about 50 percent voter registration.
Quinnipiac is awful.
Election day is November 5.
"Well, why are you losing to a convicted felon in what you try to claim as your home state or one of your home states?"
"She said at the event in Dallas, including of course in 2020 when during the height of a pandemic, you helped elect Joe Biden president of the United States and me as the first woman elected vice president of the United States."
Every day for years and years and years studying public opinion and looking at how elections turn out based off of that public opinion.
"It's, it's self-righteous."
"And that's wild, that's never been witnessed."
"But that's not close to true, according to Manning."
"But do you think the average blue collar voter in Bucks County or even Philly, do you believe those voters, who they might have voted for Joe back in 2020, do you think they're going to vote for Harris?"

"Well, Caitlin, Hugh Burns, thank you."
"And like I said, you could make an argument that this is a must-win state for both campaigns because, well, look at this."
This is an absolute travesty.
Trump flipped it.
And you think Donald Trump can change that?
It's like what's left?
"That's not exactly a very good way of looking at the election when you see that, but you look at this, Joe Biden, they have Joe Biden leading Trump in the probability, 53 to 47, which is such a cop-out cope from these people."

"Thankfully she can deliver on that excellence, but that means one mistake, one slip up is ten times worse for her than it ever would be for Donald Trump when Donald Trump can't even answer coherently what his childcare policy is."
"And when you look at the demography of it, you're getting like a Trump plus three if this holds up."
Being in the mix would lower Biden's margin of victory by five points.
"So in addition to sort of becoming more aggressive in her messaging about the former president, you see her doing media interviews all over the place, traditional stuff like 60 Minutes, but also non-traditional podcasts and radio shows."

And this is absolutely huge.
Harris is also underperforming against minority voters.
"But just also her record, you know, she isn't like this Catholic larper like Biden was who would never let people forget about it."
So all those numbers fall on him to where the jobs don't get added back while he's in office and they can manipulate numbers like this.

And economic uncertainty.
Does the campaign internally have a sense that that has begun to waver?
Trump is trusted more than Harris to handle immigration by a margin of 55% to 38%.

"And look at the difference, 44 percent of plurality, clear plurality."
It's not clear whether she'll get it.

This is a must-win situation.
"That's what she stands for, not concepts of a plan."

He's not going to be running for president.
"Yeah, it's a little bit more of an internal."

And then you know Trump has always run as an economic populist since he walked down that golden escalator nine years ago I guess almost a decade since he's been on the political scene.
So I want to talk a little bit about that.
So not only is the vote share just weighed down but the percentages are just awful for Democrats.
Jeeves?
"They think, well, at least he's owning the libs."

"Let's see who's not just reporting and the volume of content they're reporting on, but look and see who was editing photography, who was adding color grading and filtered effects to photography, who was altering these images and focused points within them to make the content seem more anthemic than it actually is."

You know you can agree to gristigry both sides.
They're going to vote on election day.
As to who I would vote for in this election I Strongly felt Kamala was more optimistic more respectful I thought she had plans that she Tried to describe in the minutes worth of time that she had I mean they really were limited with their time so I Don't know I just felt more strongly for her as opposed to her opponent I want to talk about some of the moments the debate because As we told you guys before the debate each of these individuals had a dial and if they turn the dial to the right Then they felt positive about what they were hearing in that moment if they turned it to the left They felt less so they felt negative about what they were hearing we could track that throughout the debate We're gonna show you a couple of moments where you saw the biggest movement Towards positive direction for both of those candidates You will see the lines at the bottom of the screen and you will see that movement as the sound we play you plays out We're gonna start with this Because they're radical the Democrats are radical in that and her vice presidential pick Which I think was a horrible pick by the way for our country because he is really out of it But her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine.
"And most polling down here in Miami-Dade County shows that Latinos are choosing Trump over Harris, which is why the Harris campaign has been trying to get out this message to Latino voters, sort of reminding them in a way about the immigration policies that former President Trump had, but also trying to get the message of what they would do when it comes to the economy, which is a key issue for this voting work."
"Oh, no, absolutely."
"This is Biden putting on, uh, the hat here, uh, putting on a truck."
It does.
Now we know the economy is the number one issue for voters coming up after the break.
"So right now it's all about doing those events, getting out the message."
Two thirds of them say that it's good.
Real quick.
They loved Kamala up until like two weeks ago.

That's the most important thing.
I didn't realize this.
There are things outside of it and I think that you don't have to understand it.
Are they here to solve problems or just weaponize those problems for political purposes?
So what's up with all these rich people giving their opinions about things.
"Josh Shapiro begins his day as governor of Pennsylvania, but by this evening, he may be Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate on the Democratic ticket."
"Or maybe they'll be used for, you know, I don't know what they'll be used for exactly, but I know, you know, the government denied that they were going to do the long range missiles."
"We know that the union vote is typically a dependable vote for Democrats, but Republicans have been putting effort into chipping away at that."
"And one that a lot of political pros will tell you, if people are undecided, announced that they're undecided at this stage of the race, it means they probably aren't that connected to politics and aren't gonna vote."
They went to work every single day.
It's a recurring theme and pattern.
"And they believe that Joe Biden is sending people into panic, which is causing this, which caused the situation today."
"She has a four-point lead in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania."
Look at Jen Psaki.
"This is Trump's hood, right?"
But Santa Claus is real.
She's a weird person.
"Bobby, it's sort of fascinating that Kamala seems to be struggling with younger minority voters versus Trump struggling with white women, suburban voters."
She was one of the most unlikable VPs ever.
What do you say?
"He's been holding a town hall near Philadelphia, rallying his base in this crucial state."
"Now, Selena, I want to my view of the world is there is only one selection for Kamala Harris for her running mate."
"So the Harris campaign at this point is on the defensive in a way, trying to get some of those crossover voters, perhaps, you know, she's going to be on stage with about 100 Republicans who are saying that they're going to vote for Harris."
I think you will see him gain a little bit.
He blamed a lack of air conditioning and called for music to be played.
The problem is you're still way behind the Democrats when it comes to registering to do these things when you're registering for that ballot.

"Democrats have convinced themselves, actually, no, they're not going to vote."
"Maybe I'm a Republican, I'm an independent, I'm a sort of centrist."

"I mean, this is going to be an extremely close race and it will be within the margin."
"It's a lot of what I love doing is I love helping companies become successful, which is why this election is so important to me and to all of us."
So it'd be murder.
You can see it in his face right.
And I think that Trump's decision to pick Vance as his running mate signals that that's kind of where he wants the party to move.
"Rachel, he's traveling to the state on Saturday for a rally with those top Republican candidates."

They say it has spread election misinformation.
It's crazy to me that you actually need to pay homeless people to come and see You at your rally and then not even going I mean they're getting free stuff You get a free concert man.

And we're going to get it fixed very quickly.
"And they should have strategized and he should stick to the strategy, but he can't help himself."
They were saying he he's he's a retard.

"Kit Delgado says we already know a couple things that influence human behavior, like rewards and losses, personal beliefs and motivation."
"She's in Erie, Pennsylvania tonight."

We know it's a red herring.
"Trump, a master of using personal narratives to energize his base, has continued to use this incident as a rallying cry, especially among the state's large, predominantly white working-class electorate."
People can look it up on ballot PD.
But what we see in the numbers is there really hasn't been much of a change.
"I mean, come on, let's start playing games."
Those have been the top five issues we're seeing and that hasn't really changed.
But that's not the whole story because Democrats absolutely positively need that floor in 2020 of those mail in ballots in order for when they barely won with the floor as it was in 2020.
"And that takes into account the past four years of Biden's record, which she's basically tied to with the hip."
"So the fact that he's leading in nearly every single poll should tell you there is some kind of a shift and you could talk about the midterms and polls, whatever."

"The other thing to point out about Pennsylvania is, you know, Trump just had his giant rally in Butler, Pennsylvania with Elon Musk."
"Because if Kamala can't win Pennsylvania, she's not winning."
What was it and what is it about him?
"He told our colleague, Emory Herdern, on the floor of the convention in Chicago just weeks ago that this would be a priority from him if he stays majority leader."
I bet he's so unbearably smug right now deserves to be.
"And this has been happening for decades with, you know, back since Obama's first green stimulus."
"To me, it sounds like they're saying she is going to be a lock and step, more mongering, if needed, be status quo, establishment candidate."
Not what Donald Trump and the Maga Republicans are doing by taking away your freedoms taking away women's reproductive rights trying to divide the country spewing this hate day in and day out not supporting our allies folks.
"Former president is hosting a town hall just outside of Philadelphia, while the vice president is holding a rally in Erie."
"So how do you see abortion, Ozzy, at this point impacting this race so close to Election Day, if at all?"

They released this past week and Saturday and Sunday which because we've seen a lot of this kind of really screwy down you know down deep in the weeds when you're looking at the cross tabs of polling some polling showing Donald Trump getting a huge number of black voters or Hispanic voters and then oddly very small numbers amongst white voters and that's what's kind of causing these top line numbers a little bit odd.
"Or do you believe, based on your reporting, do you conclude that these issues are already baked in the legal challenges for Trump as they look at the Trump campaign?"
"So I think Biden is a good thing, a good pillar, a good anchor."

"Like, OK, Harris at 244."
Our votes do really matter here and I think that's the message that we're trying to send and I think people have been receptive to that.
They're going to help guide them in there.
But let's be more specific.
Some even said they were worried it would hurt their businesses.
" Alright man, so we got some absolutely massive news here for Kamala Harris in the state of Pennsylvania Now we've been keeping you updated about what's going on a big thing in 2020 that actually happened was the third party support was almost Non-existent or very muted and that was a big thing that also is able to let Biden win in 2020 as opposed to 2016 Where there was a lot of third party support because Hillary was obviously, you know, not not a really great candidate So a lot of people ended up voting third party 2020 was a different scenario because it was so dire with Covid and everything and so he was able to win So what we have here is this article says Cornell West can't be on Pennsylvania's presidential ballot court decides So Cornell West of course, he's like a left-wing dude who's running He was definitely pulling some votes from Kamala Harris and definitely more from Kamala Harris and Trump So it says Cornell West can't be on Pennsylvania's presidential ballot court decides."

She was concise.
Kamala Harris is a good person.
Morning Consult is ridiculous and all over the place.
"We're living in you know what I'm saying, but when I say that I want to make it clear I'm not saying that that was fake, but you best believe in the blogosphere in this internet era Individuals are most definitely saying that here We go everybody with the Donald Trump staged a shooting just to win the election First of all Donald Trump would definitely stage a shooting with fake blood and all that just to win the election Absolutely, I agree with that But think about it He would have to fake out the CIA the United States government is going to take every resource and asset They're going to make sure that this was real if it was fake they're gonna find out So you'd have to know that I am a fake out the CIA."
"Aside from his pull in Pennsylvania, Watkins believes the governor could help shore up support from voters."
He appeared to emerge defiantly with his fist in the air but with some type of blood coming near one of his ears.

Ashley Ringelberg and her husband Sean Foy feel the weight of their votes in this battleground.
I want to ask about what issues you think we'll see Walz really focus on during this campaign.
"She's been in the party 62 years and does not mince words about Trump, noting he's a convicted felon or about Trump voters."
"And as we see Bloomberg morning counter poll jump up by seven, I'm just in college poll Trump up by 45."

"The DNC will kick off Monday, August 19 and run until Thursday, August 22."
I'm a little suspicious.
"But they do have a pathway forward with Pennsylvania now, with Tim Walz and Kamala Harris, and that's what the data has proven to us, that even the Republican pollsters, which try really hard to show Donald Trump the advantage point, show Kamala Harris tied and dead even, which is already a massive improvement off of where President Biden was when he was down five points."
"I saw it firsthand, presidential race after presidential race, that very conversation on socialism happening."

Now everyone's for Kamala.
"You know, I think all of that is a lot of petty politics, to be honest with you."
"So it's not like Quinnipiac is really the strongest pollster, especially in the Rust Belt."
Keep in mind Trump needs to win one of them.
It's like this is an etch a sketch campaign.
"So in terms of that argument, there's so many left-leaning pollsters even that have horrible track records in past elections, but they get a pass from the election mafia."
Today's rally comes as calls from Democrats asking President Biden to step down grow.
"It's not like voter registration is everything, but still you would like that number to be lower."
"If Trump wins, he's always anti, you know, like kick, let's kick everybody out and build a brick wall."
"Lies about everything, play the clip."
These are slim margins in the battleground states.

You don't have to go to college.
There are so many different metric points that tell us right now Kamala Harris is in fact turning around this election and the New York Times poll today only affirms that point even more.
You want to stick it to the man?
Not all Trump parades are made equal.
I am such a PC.
"They have hundreds of them, and they wait."
I ain't gonna lie.
I think so.
You're 100 percent sure of all that.

"And remember, Pennsylvania polling back in 2020, back in 2016 at this exact same time."
"Yes, I definitely think so."
"It wasn't just marginal, it was massive reductions."
I'm sorry I don't have time to make an actual video.
But it seems that that post-debate bump that a lot of analysts expected that she would have is pretty much gone now.
They were banking on that.
"This is an area that really, over the last three election cycles on the presidential level, hasn't really moved."
"People on the street interviews when they're talking about Kamala Harris is fake, just not real."
And what does that say about the state tonight?
That is really at the forefront of what I'm hearing from particularly young women voters on college campuses.
But the reality is that's what they did.
"A significant amount of those people are not gonna approve of Heels Up Harris, that's just a fact."
"This is full escalation into World War Three, especially with what's going on in the Middle East."
"He does not, as far as I know, make any money from this."
We currently have an office morality matters and Trump does not rank high in it.
"Harris, with her deep understanding of national policy and her ability to navigate complex issues, brings a comprehensive approach to governing."
So what has changed?
"Pennsylvania is tied, according to most polls."
Why didn't they do it?
"And we just had a graphic up there talking about, do you know what the candidates stand for?"
It's a different electorate.
They are driving rigs on election day.
It's actually a return visit.
Why aren't you inviting us to these things?
The twelfth poll was conducted between September 15th and 18 by Emerson College among 800 likely voters.

All he does is talk about himself.
"Listen, I'm voting for Trump."
That I just can't get it out of my head that somebody would go on national TV and state that.

Mr. Gala?
So Trump said on social media that he was shot and was hit by a bullet in the upper part of his right ear.
It's definitely complex.
"Rallies three months before an election don't win campaigns, but how dramatically has the presidential race been reshaped here in Arizona since President Joe Biden ended his campaign just three weeks ago."
"You have others that are a little more maybe a little more social liberal, the Harris."
"I'm telling you what, it is now 11, 02 p.m. We got up at three o'clock this morning on Monday, September 30th and we flew from Raleigh where I live up to New York City, LaGuardia."
That all sounds wonderful and like the sort of thing that you would expect and hope that any elected official would say in response to the kind of rhetoric being promoted by Trump and J.D.
But they may have spent enough money that they will have pushed this kind of anti-union lawyer and corporate lawyer over over the finish line.
"It's kind of rough, but he gets results."
I am not going back.
"So what you're talking about is a couple hundred thousand people in really six or seven states choosing the direction for a nation of 300 million, three to 30 million."

You're the one who thinks like that.
"Another morning consult poll conducted on the same dates shows Harris at 49% and Trump at 46%, a solid three point lead for Harris."
"Now, of all the metrics I've shown you today, I would argue this is the biggest disaster for Democrats as of now."
We'll see what they do.
I'm not leaving.
Please be serious.
"Again, with the betting favorites with Trump taking Pennsylvania, what happens when we turn Pennsylvania red?"
"Couple of things that stand out behind that, right?"

"There is roughly 3 million requests in 2022, roughly 1.4 million."
That's not my place to speak on that.
Maybe is a better way to say that by the Democratic base this week.
"Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state, played a pivotal role in the 2016 and 2020 elections, drawing national attention and media coverage."
"Look, for years, since he first ran in 2015, 2016, we've reported on the massive crowds that show up for his events that were not reporting it these days."
You got purses.
While the Vice President enjoys support from women and women of color.
I should be free to do so.
"And so you saw earlier up here, it's not just the Latinos, Latinx community that they're struggling with, maybe because they keep calling them Latinx."
Let's listen to a sound bite.
"Her campaign has the potential to unite the Democratic Party and inspire voters across the political spectrum, bringing together a coalition of diverse voices."
So we want to do everything we can.

Let's first off move percentage points real quickly.
So it changed in that campaign.
"It was Biden plus five, Clinton plus seven, plus eight."

"So the fact that somebody said even recently like I guess Kamala changed her opinion about fracking, like if you said that years ago that you're gonna shut down fracking and you're not gonna allow fracking, well I believe as Americans we should honor each other's work."
"And when you look at these polls, even some of the Bellwether polls, oh, Trump is up in Erie."
"And first off, just tell me about this surprising moment."
" As you know, we've been working on this for months."
"When you look at what Donald Trump has specifically said to American Jews, this notion of this dual loyalty where American Jews can only care about Israel, that is deeply offensive to me and to many others."
"Another local official, also a Republican, also infuriatingly still a Trump supporter, laid out the situation very succinctly."
"I think it'd be a smart place for him to go to Erie, honestly."
That's good.
So why is Trump campaigning in California and New York?

Florida used to be a swing state.
They're going to continue to fight price gouging and these junk fees that the Biden-Harris administration has been taking dead aim at.

They love our president and they always show up for him.
One issue which stands in stark contrast to Republicans' professed agenda is that they have been openly hostile to IVF.
"The Harris campaign has added an issues tab on the campaign website, but I wonder what you think about this perception from voters."

Explain this policy a bit more and why it's sort of stirring up this controversy.
"Now, I think he could very well be up by a little bit more and it doesn't take into account potential swings in places like Philadelphia City proper, where it's the largest county in the state."
And so Trump is using this line that Dr. Oz is who can win the general election.
I think the latter for very specific reason.
"But still, I mean, if you compare it to 2022, which again, it's a midterm year."

None of it matters.
I'm Anthony Hennen.
We're going to vote.
The remaining four pollsters though range from a plus one to Trump to a plus two for Harris.

"Largely, it has not."
"And that's because Democrats and Republicans, Republicans are putting in their early votes in that county more than any other."
Key swing state for both parties.

"Yeah, it's very suspicious."
This will depend on family size.
That's why Trump's excellent showing in the latest polls is an important step towards the presidency.
I think she's really leaning into these issues that impact people personally and then doubling down on whether it's housing or child tax credit those are those are pretty big differences and I don't think that's that's a pejorative towards it there were other issues that were being dealt with and she's her own leader she's got her own path a new way forward.
That's the kind of person who's going to help Kamala get stuff done.

Presidential debates and presidentials or anything.
"At the same time, Trump is such a unique figure that he's so much better and more appealing to Republican voters or even swing voters than in Oz or in a, or even a Dave McCormick, if you look at how much more he's running ahead of him, that maybe he's the only guy left in America who could still win of the state of Pennsylvania as a Republican."

It is what it is.
"I hope that it's gonna become a line whilst, so I'm not voting for the bully."
"Yeah, I think it's pretty interesting."
And a lot of stuff got kind of swept under the road quite literally.
"Because I don't think they've been enough for election security, even here in my own county, Fulton County, even though we're run by the Republicans."

What do you make of him talking about the enemy within?
"With its 20 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is a coveted prize for both major political parties."
Are your tax returns still unfiled?
We're doing it together.
It only costs us 500 grand.
"So, and 4% of this exit poll was Jewish."
"Well, thank you so much."
"This is oh, they go crazy when they want to try and say he's cognitively impaired."
Thank you
"Advertising, Pennsylvania has seen significant advertising expenditures from both campaigns."
"Okay, so that would be a two-point trend to the right and there's that but then of course As you can see she doesn't have much of a connection with Northeastern, Pennsylvania So as you can see through all these counties, I'm gonna multi select them and just trim them Let's let's say not anything nuts But something definitely impactful like five points to the right for Donald Trump just just based off You know these counties in Northeastern Pennsylvania and also just Eastern Pennsylvania because Biden had an advantage all there So let's let's go five points to the right."
I'm Kristen Smith.
You know that it's the new thing.
"In fact, what you just watched, it didn't end there."
"And so I feel as though Donald Trump, he's not the silver bullet that's going to save the country."
"What gives Democrats a bit of hope here is not only the work that Kamala Harris has instantly done over the three weeks in terms of all of the polling out there about bringing the pieces of the Democratic coalition back into an enthusiastic support for candidacy, but they also point to the gubernatorial race in North Carolina where the current lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson, who is a very controversial figure, is somebody that Democrats believe they can paint as far to the extreme in a way to also bring in those critical, independent voters, the suburban voters that Alyssa was talking about earlier."
"If you want to have a rally up in Minnesota test the waters, do it."
You of course were there last night for the Trump rally and have reported on the ground in the state extensively.
She definitely need to talk to black males.
And I have confidence that she'll continue that.
"So the final 2020 was, you know, Biden plus one or whatever, but compared to the RCP average from 2020 and 2016, that's a seven to five-point shift in favor of Trump."
"Look at Arizona, which is again another battle state and a joining state to California where I am right now, a state that borders Mexico where migration or illegal immigration is a big issue."
Look at 2022.
We have the lowest unemployment rate in the country.
I'll try to answer them on this podcast.
Maybe.
We're in a customization.
"Those are, that's data from local law enforcement around the country."
"And the politicians who are good at this and Governor Josh Shapiro is one of them and his predecessor was, too."
This is where there's actually some good news.
The policies of the left and Kamala Harris are destroying our women.
"It's hosted by ABC News, but you can watch it right here on CBS News 24 seven."
"As both campaigns make their final push, the outcome in Pennsylvania will likely be decided by a combination of voter turnout, enthusiasm, and how each candidate navigates the key issues like the economy, fracking, and the future of democracy."
"He was down in Michigan, he was down in Wisconsin."
The campaign has not provided any other specifics other than to say it believes it was hacked by some Iranian entity and cited a report that was released on Friday by Microsoft warning that Iranian-backed entities or Iranian-based entities had been doing or attempting to do these kinds of things.
"Thousands of people braved the sweltering summer heat, waiting for hours under the blazing sun to attend the highly anticipated rally."
"Many years ago, my father had started having breathing problems with no concrete answer as to why."
"In Tampa, they had 100 mile gusts of wind."
So that's just where my focus continues to be.
"This county voted for Romney, for crying out loud and voted for Biden by just under twenty points, but this county in recent months has seen a surge of Republican support."
This is effectively Joe Biden's home state.
RFK Jr. is not going to get 10%.
I really don't eat a lot of beef anymore.
"So I guess if I were Biden, I would interpret that poll as definitely more work to do in Michigan."
"As we move closer to election day, expect Michigan to be a hotly contested battleground, with both parties fighting for every vote."
She's been loyal so far but she's going to cut her own path.
"So it doesn't escalate any further, but it is crazy."
"And then he says he's pro life strong on crime, the border election F word."
He was like the second highest donor to their campaign saying that they manipulated the election with big tech.
"The other day, this was crazy, too."
What have you found?
She was Obama's field director in Pennsylvania back in 2008.
"And instead, they've turned the whole issue into cash grabs."
But what's going to happen is this is what people say when they answer the polls.
Do black men have more concerns than other men with their crypto?
It's almost like this echo chamber isn't tight enough to keep these people over here in the MSNBC column contained.
All of them are blue.
"Joe Biden, now they're trying to say, well, he's a convicted felon."
Let's take a look at it once again on our decision desk HQ forecast map.
"And so you know that I haven't thought that Trump had an age problem because I'm like, look, if you think the things he's saying is crazy, he's always been crazy, right?"
"She was trying to escape her home in Lebanon and as she was walking out with her children, she was advancing to the car when a bomb had just dropped on the car and killed her in front of her children."
The Washington Post.
"Then this one, we got the fleece lining on there."
We're going to talk to some independent voters there about why they're independent why they feel like they're an island and what are they looking for in one of these candidates.
So at least in 2020 Quinnipiac very much not overestimated Biden support a little bit.
"Martinez is passionate about healthcare reform, particularly in making healthcare more accessible and affordable, aligning with Harris' healthcare policies."
We're going to talk about what some Pennsylvanians has to say about it.
So Donald Trump is really surging in the key state of Pennsylvania.
"It's okay to not trust journalists and experts, but from widely disparate ideological sources."
Here are some key aspects that highlight its role.
"Maine and New Hampshire, plus the 2nd congressional district in Maine and Nebraska."
"And that's the real big question because even though the Democrats are losing voters, those who are registering now as non-party affiliates or non-affiliated voters, which is right now the largest chunk of people registering in Pennsylvania, they seem to be becoming more Democratic."
U S Russia prisoner swap.
Polls of Pennsylvania in the presidential race are even closer.
"The story was real because I'm guessing liberals knew the higher up Democrats knew that the story, the Hunter Biden laptop story was what the Republicans were sitting on because of course it's going to get released a few weeks before the election."
Listen closely.
He's not a threat no more.
"Democrats added only 17,000."
What can we expect from the former president today?
But they're into the cooking.
Do y'all realize how serious of a situation that was?
"Anthony Salvanto, as always, thank you for bringing this to us."
This approach stands in stark contrast to the divisive politics of her opponents.
They're flooding the water levels or big lead.
"Truckers, they are busy serving us, the American people."
Now we're for it.
"Historically, mail-in ballots have been a significant source of democratic votes, and any reduction in the number of valid ballots could favor Trump's campaign."
"In fact, New York city and its five boroughs, very democratic."
I've said it before.
"We know that President Biden is expected to also campaign in Florida for former governor, Charlie Crist, now campaigning for his old job, but in a different party."
Ms Harris announced a plan to give black men more economic opportunities and described some of her opponents' behaviour as increasingly unhinged.
CBS News estimates have them neck and neck in the state.
"That's not really a good sign for Democrats, regardless of the spin that we will see."
I brought about automatic voter registration in Pennsylvania.
You look at Morning Compost like they're in the mix and they are a horrendous pollster with an awful track record.
"But starting 2012, going back, like Donald Trump, the reason that they kept having him on Fox, this is before, oh, Mark Penn in 2008 doing that stuff."
Hillary is also coming out of the woodwork.
"It's immature, and it's using my body for spite."
You have this beautiful brain.
She was leading in Pennsylvania.
Let me go over to Twitter and let's see if we can look at some video together.
Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely Sir that you will absolutely accept the result of this election.
So we'll see what happens in terms of that.
In a statement the Harris campaign says Trump's proposals to raise the national sales tax will raise costs for families by thousands of dollars per year.
"To not have to pay taxes on that would save her conceivably $30,000 a year, which she said would be a down payment on a house."
She sent it to some of the state party leaders and it's pretty scathing.
"Look at the confidence in this woman's eyes, the way she answers."
The community is not a monolith.
That means nothing to me I believe that women have tons of rights and I think that we've come very far throughout history in terms of our rights And I don't I'm not voting on gender for a presidential candidate I'm voting on who's going to get things done and who's going to save America Absolutely.
It's half the place left.
They think it's okay.
"He has to win Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania."
" And here in the United States, former President Donald Trump held two major rallies in the key battleground states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin over the weekend."
"Arizona has become a focal point in national elections, characterized by its rapidly changing demographics and shifting political allegiances."
But one thing is for sure Pennsylvania is shaping up to be one of the most critical battlegrounds in the 2024 election.
He is stuck there.
"I think just yesterday and today, Tim Walz was in rural Lancaster County and up in Erie and rural Fayette County."
That just made my heart swell.
"Trump's campaign can argue that if they can secure such wins on election integrity issues, they will be effective in other areas as well."
So we'll see how that gets resolved in the next coming eight days.
"And so Fox News fuels this birtherism, which then fuels Trump and now is utterly appalled that they're losing control of it."
"Someone says you know they're concerned about reproductive health care, you want to talk about Kamala Harris' opinions on that."
Talk about outliers.
"Trump won in two polls, but Harris gained a slight edge in four polls."
"Vance has been on TV constantly, and he does a lot of press conferences as well that it's a kind of double edged sword to caramelize not giving herself the opportunity to make mistakes, but at the same time, it kind of cuts off access to who she is."
It was Walz who first dubbed the Republican nominees weird two weeks ago.
"So in order to do that, we said, heck, why not?"
There has to be some true dire situations.
"Now, in contrast, Donald Trump is managed to get just about 310 odd million dollars."
"But he also criticized her Republican opponent this fall, arguing that former President Donald Trump would be more likely to cross a picket line than to join one."
"And there's a significant, although shrinking, rural population, white voters without college degrees who make up Mr. Trump's base still account for roughly half the vote."
"So if they're admitting that Trump is actually tied with Harris in Pennsylvania, more than likely, that probably means he's up by two or three."
Like is this going to be like a pie chart?
"So, Governor, appropriately, the spilly suburbs and city of Philadelphia gets a lot of attention."
"Yeah, I can imagine there."
I think it is safe to say that MSNBC is not reporting with the same level of integrity as Newsmax.
This is something that voters continuously say they trust her more than Donald Trump on.
"And I learned the other day, he can take a vintage truck apart and put it back together again, which is just cool."
"And drink your, drink something if you got it."
She sounded presidential and I think she's gonna be a unifier.
That was the best interview I've ever seen of her.
Our polling has it pretty much even here.
But this is also something that is important to Trump.
I had four interviews with Joe Biden during the 2020 election.
"As of a couple of days ago, and these numbers actually have been updated, Democrats are not even at 60%."
" Moderate voters in Pennsylvania don't really want to vote Kamala, although they don't like Donald Trump that much either."
"A new worry since our last visit in May, Trump running mate, JD Vance."
"These areas have seen a shift in voter sentiment, especially among women and college-educated voters who have increasingly moved away from traditional Republican support."
Let's take a listen to part of Trump's speech at the RNC.
"Zach, what can you tell us about the man who was arrested near a Trump rally near Coachella over the weekend?"
"He's very unpopular in a lot of places around the country, but he's from Pennsylvania."
"He is on his way, I believe, to the hospital."
"But, you know, what else are you going to take it or leave it?"
"Look at these numbers in 2020 at the same time frame Republicans had 376,000 requests."
You don't even say hello.
"I'm not denying that, but funny enough, Axios actually looked into this."
So it's there are plenty of Pennsylvania Republicans who are open to persuasion.
Thank you so much for that.
"Hello, Arizona."
Donald Trump on the other hand turned his event into a dance party yesterday after two people suffered medical emergencies at the event.
"Look, our economy is making good progress."
So we can talk about the issues.
So what do you guys think?
"And so especially for our beautiful truckers, we are pushing them to get a mail-in ballot."
I can hear the yelling behind you Scott.
"But secondly, look at the percentage like Republicans went down roughly 12 to 15% or whatever it was Democrats went down 20 to 25%."
"Here in Arizona, you don't even have to wait."
"And now if when she takes her dog for a walk, she has to stay inside of the building so that she can call for help if need be."
And it's like Kamala Harris's entire record just doesn't doesn't matter.
"The eighth poll was conducted by Marist College between September 12th and 17th among 1,163 registered voters."
It should start with things that are bipartisan right now.
"So Trump definitely has a unique point of strength there I want to talk about why Pennsylvania is the most important state in the election Which is why we're going to be talking about it so much It's because if you give everybody all their states that they won not in 2020 But like and these doesn't mean safe states just because they're in the deepest color But it's just states that are not considered to be the seven big competitive swing states So if you give each candidate their safer states, let's just say well Kamala Harris, let's just give Trump, North Carolina, right?"
How many cookies do you expect to sell this year?
Because those groups tend to vote more.
"I have already provided them many times, including quite recently, and they were flawless."
A whole lot of Eagles and Steelers in your fantasy draft.
We now have to take him literally.
There are many on the left wing of the Democratic party dislike him for his support for Israel and school vouchers predicted a more traditional betting site where trades are settled in old-fashioned dollars shows a similar pattern with 66% odds for Shapiro and 26% for Waltz.
She's still part of the administration and really honors Biden for both choosing her to be vice president and endorsing her very early in this race.
"And those earning about that threshold may over the US taxes, despite already having paid taxes in their host nation."
"So, we've heard this time and time again."
And you know Tim Lall's talk about that.
"Gen Z and millennials combined, 18 to 43 years old, now make up the largest voting block in U.S. history at 48.5 percent."
"Now, going back to the moment there one more time for our viewers that are maybe just joining us here on Live Now from Fox, we are talking to Jenny Katz there, the mother of three who just there was chaos at the checkout line because you have a former president there."
Shapiro is popular among his constituents in a battleground state with a 61% approval rating according to a poll released by Fox News last month.
"And, you know, she has I've never seen a candidate have such a treasure trove of information that pushes back on everything and anything that they're trying to portray portray that she is today."
"Now, I want to be clear that I am not saying there is no pathway for Trump if he loses Pennsylvania."
I'm going to ask you one question.
"Tonight, President Biden will deliver remarks ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act."
I did.
"Look, I think there's a lot of enthusiasm for the former president."
"RFK juniors endorsed Trump, so he's not going to take much from Trump."
"That's your opinion, ace."
This is walls in Pennsylvania.
That's all.
But do you care more about the election now?
"So this is in line with what you would expect, and when you look at it, Donald Trump, among those definitely voting close to 50%, this is a brutal poll for Joe Biden out of Pennsylvania."
They really did.
"And so what I say to them is, look, you can't vote for Trump."
"And the more people that bank their vote, the more surgical we can use our resources to direct people, low propensity voters on election day to get out."
"I mean, I listen to some of the language that's being thrown around."
So I wish I could tell you that this presidential race is going to be exciting.
"If it's worth saying, I think most of us can agree on is that these McDonald's fries are good."
To I'll give it for but tentative to over there.
The path to 270 electoral college votes is nearly impossible for Trump Vance without Pennsylvania.
I know you all in this room are involved.
I want to just for a moment mention my friend Bob Casey.
"If you found this analysis insightful, don't forget to like, subscribe to Global News Network, and drop a comment below."
"Just like Eddie said, trying to peel around those margins, women in a state that Trump needs to win, a group that Donald Trump is not doing well in, and a group that needs to improve in the home stretch."
"So I would say like a 5150 poll, for example, would actually be better than this kind of a, or I guess that wouldn't be a possibility, right?"
"The crowd was a vast sea of red, white and blue, with enthusiastic attendees proudly sporting Make America Great Again hats and energetically waving Trump flags."
"Think back to the primaries this year, even after Nikki Haley exited the race, she was still getting a sizable portion of voters in the suburbs, places like here in the suburbs of Philadelphia."
This is a man who does not tolerate profanity or inappropriate language of any kind.
It's really exciting because we haven't had a total darkness outside since November through March.
It's going to be a battleground state right up until the very end.
Do you think that Pennsylvania was a battleground state when Biden was in the race?
I think he would compliment her.
So maybe that could be something to watch.
We'll call them Rameshian kind of Republicans that live on the South side.
Five point three point average R plus four point nine.
"But one thing is for sure, Pennsylvania is shaping up to be one of the most critical battlegrounds in the 2024 election."
We've had a few polls over the past week that have had Donald Trump leading.
Morning Compost missed by eight points in the popular vote in 2022.
This places Trump ahead by a narrow margin of one percentage point.
And the Democrats have put us in this position by not having a primary.
"She doesn't even live in the district, but that doesn't matter to them because they can flood the airways with millions and millions of dollars of lies on TV and on the Internet."
They need a real plan and they need to execute it flawlessly and they need to do it fast.
"Then you base on your team, obviously, because they help the whole team win."
But the fear tactic is not going to work.
Just like a lot of these pollsters from the mainstream media.
Every vote counts.
"They may not, they may not vote for Trump, but they're certainly not going to vote for Harris."
Transitor.
The contrast in this election couldn't be more clear.
"And so when he ran for president the first time, he said he would support punishing women who got an abortion."
My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency.
"So, you know, people are much more savvy about getting their information."
"And then she's just going to be like, I grew up in a middle class family."
"They always mention, you know, it's a way of demeaning."
What made you change that position at the time?
What did it actually do much though?
And Harris beats Trump in this poll by three points.
The Trump campaign estimated 5 to 6000 people were here for this event.
So this is actually I think like the first sort of nonpartisan reputable pollster we've had in a while.
My dad worked as a stuntman most of his life.
What do you mean that they're worried about Pennsylvania?
You having a good time today?
So I think she sees this as an opportunity and a good one.
"They think they're smarter than you and that they can sell you a line and a story, and that's not President Trump."
"You can clearly see though America was always polarized in the sense that there are red states which vote the Republican way, primarily in the Midwest."
I think that's really important and that's something that gets overshadowed.
It's kind of an open secret here in Pennsylvania.
"Social media and and making it a major issue You know, the problem is is that we're numb where so much of this are we're numb and not just numb But there's a there's an amnesia factor involved here, too but I guess that That's what I meant about a normal country a normal country would say that these are important issues But we are numb and we are exhausted I think by some because there's something every single day and in terms of my particular Job still as as as a journalist when I'm not teaching I think that's important enough to point out even if people are too numb to take it on and Even if I end up having a smaller audience Maybe because people don't want to read it on that kind of stuff on any given day And I'm gonna write a column about this tomorrow about these COVID tests In your column you use a very personal and partisan voice Was there something specific that?"
We really haven't taken advantage of it yet.
"I saw this video earlier today, but it was so short."
"Joe Biden may be old and senile, but every once in a while, old and senile, people have a moment where they're like, Ooh, this will mess with someone."
So many interesting aspects of this polling.
Let me know what you guys think.
"These counties all add up and you realize immediately, oh, wait a minute."
"So that's why it's down by more, but this is still pretty crazy when you look at the difference and you would say that would at least help Trump by you would have to say 20, maybe 30,000 votes."
"Remember, the margins here are just so thin when it comes to taking back the majority in the House."
I don't think it's going to hurt him at this point.
I still don't know what my debate plans are.
I think everybody agrees.
And there's just so many swing voters that they determine the outcome.
"Sabatini, the chaos of what?"
Many of the state's most well-connected Democrats have been worried about the operation for months.
Key to where we are today as a country.
"Please go there, sign up for their mailing list, follow them on Twitter."
And there she came to talk about cutting costs.
"Okay, so former President Donald Trump was holding a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania."
"But even today, as many of you know, too many parents know the pain of having a child sickened by contaminated water."
JD Vance is taking away from the ticket.
Nathaniel was showing us the polls just super tight between former President Trump and Vice President Harris.
I need to pretend like Harris has got this sort of stuff.
"I mean, she got more baggage than anyone I've ever seen run for president."
" Well, joining us now is former senior adviser to Donald Trump, Christian Witten."
"So if we're looking at coefficient, they're actually the worst one here."
"Cooper's interest in urban development and affordable housing drives his support for Harris, who has outlined plans to address the housing crisis in America."
Is that a state North Carolina we're talking about that Kamala Harris can really win?
It makes absolutely no sense.
"But the margin may be smaller, if that makes sense."
"Obviously, what's so shocking about that?"
"Put in whatever P you want, whatever his polling number is."
"It's like, no, clearly he's not."
"Like, oh man, you know things are bad when Dick Cheney is coming out for Kamala, Karl Rolv is coming out for Kamala, Mitt Romney is coming out for Kamala."
"I think it is largely economically illiterate, but she of course is economically illiterate, so it's par for the course."
"Right now, inflation and prices are up, wages and savings are down under the disastrous policies of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden."
"There is a group that's emerging, especially out in the East Valley that is saying, look, we're supporting Democrats because they actually have common sense."
"The Harris campaign and its allies have locked in $77 million in ads for Pennsylvania, showcasing just how important the state is to both sides."
"Well, Sean, this is the single most important industry."
And do you think that may have hurt his chances in any way?
We've seen polls out of the Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News over the past month or so that also show Donald Trump is in the lead in Michigan.
A lot of people look for it.
"While he may not be on the campaign trail every day, he remains a powerful voice in the Democratic Party, using his platform to advocate for key issues."
"Because if you don't have the right team, the right strategy, it doesn't matter how much money you have."
"These are the smaller counties that however, despite their smaller size, will take the eventual winner over the top."
"Social issues, including abortion rights and gun control, are also likely to play a role in the 2020 four-election."
"And that home ownership is one of the surest ways to build intergenerational wealth, right?"
Wisconsin to a two-three-point lead.
He did worse.
"I understand just how critical jobs in the natural gas industry are here in this commonwealth, particularly for our building trades in the southwestern part of our state and elsewhere."
"If he wins the presidential race in November, Biden and Trump's stance on the proposed deal coming as the two candidates face the heat of election year politics."
"You can make an argument that well, it was the middle of the summer."
"That 80,000 number, I want everybody to write that on the chalkboard in your brain."
It's the only place I know where there's three acceptable pronunciations.
"The way that the country was handled last four years, people lost their jobs."
And Harris's ability to appeal to them could prove decisive.
We talked to a lot of people.
But you take that energy out.
And I think that might tell us something.
This is a very winnable election for Trump.
"Geographically, Pennsylvania is conveniently located for both candidates."
"Although I do believe the mail-in balloting, you know, things have changed in the last couple of years for processing, it's no longer COVID and all of that."
You bear your soul.
"Sam Brown, he was endorsed by Trump."
Yeah when I'm not on the trail I'm typically on the Hill.
She will not ban fracking.
So the Harris campaign working very quickly on this one and this is just the latest moment in what has been an anything but ordinary election season.
"His children, quite honestly, with that much wealth and that much fame, they should be crackheads."
There was an instance where Kamala Harris showed up at a restaurant that was full of supporters and it turned out that they had cleared out the restaurant and bust in a bunch of supporters.
We don't want him to leave.
I'm Enjoy your day and thanks for coming.
I've been skating for decades.
Does it's a complete mess?
"It's good news, but you really want to be up by three, four because then you're starting to get outside of the margin of error."
"But if I am Kamala Harris, this makes me very, very nervous because I am underperforming Biden four years ago."
So to me it's just really hard because it's what they really do when they're elected.
That's what the individual looks like.
She could go to Georgia.
Truly a moment.
"And that's a major reason why now we have Kamala Harris in the lead in Pennsylvania, where Joe Biden just simply did not."
"In Pennsylvania, we've had almost all the shipping has been red cookies."
All right we'll see if Michelle comes out and changes the narrative out there on the campaign trail.
"Dan, do you buy those polling numbers?"
These investments present a historic opportunity to change the game for so many communities struggling to access clean water across the country.
Is it baked in or the image of Trump every day repeating the kind of salacious details of the Stormy Daniels saga?
"But here is a question that she got asked about reparations in particular, an issue that they continually bring up, in my opinion, to gaslight this demographic, just like we saw in California, where Gavin Newsom was like, no, yeah, reparations, yeah, totally, we'll do it for sure."
"And of course, she has her E.V."
I do not like to hear.
"And there's a quite a there's a lot of votes in the Allegheny County is Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas, the uninitiated here."
It's malleable.
But the biggest shifts came mostly in the Scranton area.
Be patient with Pennsylvania.
You name anything that's been pretty much like conspiracy theory that came true now as a conspiracy truth.
"Now, there's all these criticisms that people will throw at Dr. Oz and you know, some of them I don't necessarily agree with."
I knew who I was standing with.
They're just coming out.
"In August, AKA formed the political action committee to raise money to support federal candidates, joining other divine nine organizations that recently made the same move."
It's the latest in what has been several visits to our state over the last six months.
"She has articulated clear and concise positions on a wide range of topics, from health care and immigration, to foreign policy and climate change."
It voted for Joe Biden by less than one point.
"Well, I remember he was saying that, you know, Barack Obama wasn't born in this country."
It might be.
And that's why you saw a bunch of New York Republicans vote against the bill at the time.
He is falling further and further behind.
And he would talk to Anna's point about economic populism.
"And that does mean that Trump hits exactly 270 electoral votes now, which would be enough to make him just the second president to serve a non-consecutive term in the White House."
"Here's another thing I peeped, a lot of y'all are hopping on the same train talking about some God protected President Trump."
"Harris is focusing on urban voters in cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, emphasizing issues like health care reform and climate action."
"If you want to look at Northampton County and look at the relative demography of it, it's 54% working class white, which is the case of a lot of these, you know, Midwestern areas that will dictate the election."
 Rasmussen has Trump beating Harris by three points in Pennsylvania.
Obama had 60 for a little bit.
Harris coming in plus six over Trump and plus five guys.
"We call them beanies where I'm from, but out here, I think they're toboggan."
"Now if Harris is going to outperform Biden anywhere, it is going to be in a state like Georgia, with a high percentage of African American and young Democratic voters that simply were not energized by Biden's candidacy, to say the least."

This is the real reason we elect Trump.
He went into the lion's den.
How do you look at the differential there?
Concrete plans.
Let's dive deep into the evolving dynamics of these critical states.
Trump campaign comparison.
I'm the best one.
And feel reminiscent of what we saw with Obama back in 2012 with an expanded Democratic coalition.
"While Senator Kelly, another often mentioned name, also comes from a battleground state in Arizona, that only carries 11 electoral votes, compare that to Pennsylvania's 19."
He was great.
"And of course, Vice President Kamala Harris denounced some of that as well."
You're telling me that not a single person at The New York Times or Quinnipiac looked at this poll instead of themselves.
"Look, I think he brings the fact that he has served our country in the military, the fact that he is someone who's worked his way through life from a working class family."
"And he has very much leaned into trying to target men, not just conservative men, but sort of socially liberal men, Latino men, black men."
"I mean, how can you watch that and not feel excited and hopeful?"
It's the battleground state.
"Technically, you don't own your money either, chatter."
"Please welcome City Clerk for the City Council of Pittsburgh, Kimberly Clark Baskin."

"Oh, he tearing up, boy."
We got to take this to the finish line.
They were trying to basically go away with the Secret Service and it's so odd that now they feel as though that the Secret Service didn't really step up to protect Trump in a way that they should have.

Both Trump and Harris taking their campaign campaigns through Pennsylvania.
"This video highlights the top 15 Pennsylvania billionaires who have donated to Kamala Harris' campaign, ranked from the least to the highest donor."

They're eating the catfish.
"We know, but I'm objective and it wouldn't be fair for me to cover the Pennsylvania polls without shedding some light on some Wisconsin news that might not be so good except, you know, we got to understand where this is coming from because you have a poll in Wisconsin."

John Federman is here for the working man.
"And so the New York Times, when I'm sure the Trump campaign wrote off as fake news, but then came Quinnipiac University, a nonpartisan poll that doesn't dabble into Democrat or Republican politics."
I'm here to widen the middle class.

I'm sure a lot of them may come home to Trump.
This year he made Pittsburgh the site of his first joint campaign appearance with Harris.
"Today, Trump is participating in multiple town hall events while Harris returns to Pennsylvania."
Trump is higher than ever.
Joe Biden starts off at 214 points in this race.

Trump support for as far as the eye can see.

"Trump's really cutting into it, Alan."
This is not a thing.
Is there a vibe change that you're seeing in Pennsylvania that your campaign is seeing right now?

Got to love the old cookie poll.
"When you think about it, the big guys only have one half."
"Yeah, we saw that, it was a good interview."
"At one point, there was a man from the media who was very close to me trying to get a view of Trump."

Trump finished one point ahead of Harris in this poll.
"""'Voters are able to see through his empty promises,' Shapiro said."
"When you see what happened in Pennsylvania, do you see a microcosm for something that could be playing out nationwide among some Republicans skittish about Trump or is it more just a protest and they'll come home in November?"

Let me know in the comments below.
This is a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice and a champion.

"But now that it's Harris, we feel like she's someone that we'll be able to organize with and potentially work with in D.C. Today, they were preparing people for door knocking, hoping that one on one encounters can change minds."

"And they are so well aware that even though this area in particular voted for President Biden back in 2020, there is plenty of opportunity for her to lose, which is why she's trying to meet face to face with as many people as she can to try to get her message across."
So let's check this one out.
"I remember hearing that Kamala Harris went online and was like, you know how the Olympics were like the opening of the Olympics."
It's a primary source income for my family.

Oh absolutely.
"Last week, there's a poll from Muhlenberg College and the Morning Call where Casey had a 46, 42 lead over McCormick."

"Seems like you have maybe a couple cases of that being the case, but not always is what it really seems."
"Pennsylvania stands out as a microcosm of broader national political trends, characterized by stark contrast between urban and rural areas."
"Well, this commentary really digs into some demographic shifts that are happening all over the country, which is really interesting."
I wish they did.
"Okay, abortion, which I think is Democrats best issue."
That's our founding partner right there.
I do not oppose fracking.
It's inexplicable.
And that's what he said about Kathy Barnett.
"Well, I'll leave that."
That's great.
"Now where we are here in downtown Erie, this area is generally democratic, and we went out to a diner in Waterford about 20 minutes from here, and that was a bit more Republican, a bit more Republican area, more Trump supporters out there."
But I know about sports.
Look at all this.
We all know that America became great off the backs of free black labor.
So we are running like I.E.
"It was, you know, 64% Democrat 25.5% Republican now."
I really want to focus on this.
It is doable.
"You know, Hannah, I'm in Bucks County."
That matters in a campaign when you've got people enthusiastic to support you.
"It's what we're doing in Pennsylvania, the way we're leading on that, to provide real freedom so a kid gets a great quality education, a safe street to walk down, economic opportunity, the ability to marry who they love and worship where they want join a union if they'd like to be able to pursue their life on their own terms."
"So they're off by, you know, two to three points, but insider advantage is relatively speaking a good pollster."

And I'm proud that he's going to continue doing that alongside me.
That's all I know as of right now.
"And we've seen so many polls that have this race, you know, Harris plus two were under in the polls."
That's exactly.
"So now that Kamala Harris has taken economically populist positions, Trump is defending corporations."
They are blaming Biden for this.
She was talking about it before she was even running.
"And by the way, I will give you one guess."
Let me show you this one because it really pertains to what you think or what we were going to see in in the election coming up.
"I mean, this inflation has been a 22% or greater tax on working families, on people on fixed income."
And if black men weren't excited about that enough because Kamala Harris is going to be creating new opportunities.
"The Harris campaign has a very definite attitude that former president Trump, by denying the 2020 election and rhetoric on the campaign trail so far, makes him unfit."
"Democrat incumbent Bob Casey, still in the lead, but that lead has been shrinking in recent polls."
"Hey, did you ever see the unselect committee?"
This is the energy for something like this.
"And then Kathy Barnett comes out of nowhere, has a great debate performance, and it started to get really ugly."
The Harris actually wants to do something for a country and I'm excited about them.
"Nice to meet you, Charlotte."
"But the measure in between, the people in between are really going to make the difference in this election."
Harris is prepared for the upcoming presidential debate between stops inside stores in Pittsburgh.
That's part of the oppo that sort of been flung back and forth in the race to journalists and conservative media.
What do you make of this?
All the counties around there are Trump Country.
He's been forgetting things.
It's certainly a state that Vice President Kamala Harris covets the most and it's a location in which both candidates have spent an enormous amount of resources.
"I just want more but Burgos who chairs the Latinos con Harris, which I think is gendered."
"And for the last four years, she's been acceptable and for fracking."
Has that changed in 2024?
So they can at least take on some culpability.
"Everything that I've seen outside of like a Republican internal last night, everything I've seen is very, very good."
"When you believe in ending child poverty, you fight for that."
I would just lean into it and use it as a marketing campaign.
The Vice President's lead has dropped 1% in both of those measures since mid-September.
But let's see.
Does anyone really expect her to win?
I serve the American people.
He said that she never called or came to visit after any other hurricanes in the last three and a half years.
"Inside Advantage, Emerson, even Trafalgar and CBS News."
"Does the White House worry that voters are going to sort of say, even discount what the president's saying more?"
"However, a lot of them don't want to vote Kamala either."
"Now while Trump is on the other side of the state, Harris is focusing on Erie County, as we said, this bellwether area, trying to win the state's 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state."
"And I'm just baffled that suddenly the police are the bad guy, and the January 6 prisoners are the good guys and should be pardoned."
Especially in a state like Florida where Trump holds an undeniable edge among Hispanic voters?
Unless you're supporting the Republican Party and Donald Trump.
I asked just how she was going to do that.
Any sense of where things stand in those counties?
"Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben."
But I do think that you really have to look at these moderate Republican voters.
The only ones when everyone else is saying Trump's up in Pennsylvania.
"And so 312 to 226, I say this a lot."
He's a liability.
She gets asked a tough question.
So there's no.
Lost.
So really big news coming out from some legal news.
We talked about it earlier.
So fracking is hugely important for the voters of Pennsylvania.
And this poll sheds light on the complexities of this key voting bloc.
"Meanwhile, Trump's rallies in the state have continued to draw large crowds, maintaining his base's enthusiasm."
"For your outstanding next United States Senator, Ruben Gallo."
"We do still have two states to go though, up here in the Northeast."
" We are, if you can believe it, just 21 days out from election day."
"But it's a historical moment that matters in rallying people, boosting morale and telling people you need to get out, you need to vote."
Political fans.
And I'm going to try and be as influential as I can to inspire people to be as brave as Trump is in the face of taking a bullet.
I do what I want and I'm not responsible for anything.
"You heard him like well, you know, is it possible trump?"
"We hope I'm so excited to listen to that because I'm totally in that culture, the whole alternatives, skateboard and all that."
Trump inching slightly ahead.
She's out there saying.
"While Donald Trump on the other hand, who's seen as someone who's very business friendly, has managed to generate a watch list of just about 300 plus million dollars."
So what will President Trump be doing during the DNC?
"If you're in business and somebody you're doing business with, just outright lies and manipulates, you stop doing business with them."
"I'm looking forward to it, but I'm also just like this is going to be a big moment."
"And here on our map, it gets marked down as Safe Democrat adding 10 more electoral votes to the Harris tally."
Now they're running ads against Jill Stein in Michigan.
So says Kamala Harris will legalize recreational marijuana breaking down unjust barriers that hold black men and other Americans back and making sure black Americans have opportunities to succeed as the marketplace takes shape.
"She went to a county you've probably never heard of, Beaver County, in the southwestern corner of our state."
P.A.
" The big debate tomorrow night is in the city of Philadelphia, which is in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
It's pretty crazy what Bill Clinton saying.
Would you rather have a 51 or 52 seat majority with cinema and mansion or a 50 seat majority with none of those with like maybe tester being the most conservative for Harris?
"In recent weeks, the in-state campaign has brought on new staff, which has given some Democrats more confidence, but they fear they're running out of time."

That's exactly what the data is suggesting in Pennsylvania and all around the country.
And Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona tweet last night made it look for a little bit like he thinks it's not him.
I couldn't do a better job.
This is Trump's hood guys.
"So you know, the big issue here with this is the amount of early voting and mail and ballots that there are going to be."
"And if Trump is really winning Pennsylvania, do you really think he's losing Wisconsin?"
Do we notice a difference in the polls once these candidates make a stop and are stumping on the campaign trail?
"Once we get a vote banked, in other words, you vote by mail, we bank your vote."
Harris is not really able to stop the bleeding.
But I really appreciate your time.
He just got a drug problem.
"And then in addition to that, you also have some rulings that impact how ballots will be addressed and how election night will be handled here in Georgia."
So they were counting them throughout the day.
The 13th poll was conducted between September 19 and 25 by Morning Consult with 924 likely voters.
That was three weeks ago.
"Obviously, at that point in 2016, we did know who was going to win Pennsylvania."
I remember the inflation much higher from the 1970s.
And mainly these small margins.
"By ensuring that mail-in ballots are subject to strict requirements, the ruling may reduce the number of ballots that could otherwise be counted for democratic candidates."
"Okay, let's see."
"Where's the rest of the Democratic Party, in particular, Michelle Obama?"

So that's a good thing.
Urging Trump to stay focused on issues like the economy and protecting the border.
A little bit.
"Historically, they don't show up in mass like the older age groups."
Biden was able to pick off those working class voters.
There was rumors of an Atlas Intel drop over the weekend.

The Trump mugshot design.
"People were waiting, including after the debate, thinking, well, at the debate, we'll get some specifics."

"Are they going to be, is it going to be a Trump country?"
We know how he gets people to go to the polls and also the independent support that I think Trump will get in these swing States over Harris.

You're just one of the victims.
"And now Harris is leading Trump here by five points when every other poll except for one has the race at three, at two points or under, aside from USA Today, which had it at three points or under and a 4.4 percent margin of error."

Hospitals overrun.
Please tell me he's okay.
"Yo, I love the wordplay on that name."
