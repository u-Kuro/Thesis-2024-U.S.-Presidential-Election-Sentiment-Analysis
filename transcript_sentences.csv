"Stierwald suggests that the dynamics of turnout, who shows up to vote and in what numbers, could ultimately define the election outcome."
"Or do you want to, well, you had said you wanted to close with a specific song."
I'm really proud of that work we're doing in Pennsylvania.
"Like, for instance, it should be in like this itself would bring Donald Trump out in the margin of error."
Thank you so much for joining us again.
It's the battleground state.
Jesus died for them.
"And when you're young and stupid, you think that that means, yeah, the way the warrior's death, because I'm a killer."
"He believes that Make America Great Again means making America back to work in those industrial era industries that he believes should be onshore taken back, especially after the pandemic."
"So they have millions of dollars in this agreement in this deal, which we, by the way, killed."
Use whatever vocabulary term you want.
Nobody's leaving.
Kamala Harris received 51% of the vote and Donald Trump 45%.
I'll be back.
"And they have this thing about, you know, they want to put gas out of business."
"So back when Barack Obama won this area, he had 49% of the vote."
Some of these House races you name it and they were able to kind of make Mike Braun underperform and make Donald Trump underperform as well.
There's sun beaming down on this beautiful body in a bathing suit.
Then Donald Trump has a proven track record of ripping away people's rights and freedoms and a blueprint in this project 2025 for how to limit people's freedoms even more going forward.
"For those that don't remember, polling in Pennsylvania can be pretty bad."
They refuse to talk to each other.
What makes you so excited to be at a Trump rally?
"A couple of weeks ago, his running mate had the nerve, the hook spot, to say that Donald Trump salvaged the Affordable Care Act."
 Anybody who's about beating down other people is a coward!
 Hello everybody and welcome back to Red Eagle politics.
"Well, this is somebody who tracked more to the left as governor than he did as a U.S. House member."
Make sure to add the blades to your cart.
And we also believe that freedom requires us to recognize that other people have the freedom to make different choices.
So modeling what has been working there to basically the federal level is something that we need to do with the Kamala Harris and Tim Walz ticket.
"Now, look at Haley's numbers in Bucks County, outside Philadelphia, 19 percent better than her statewide Montgomery County, almost a quarter of the vote."
"I mean, in those traditional Democrat seats, is it important for voters to see that this is a smooth transition, if you like, an endorsement?"
"Well, that's awesome."
"It looks like while he had his head turned, speaking to a screen, he was in fact shot."
I'll have to decide that on election night or whenever the results are determined.
Trump said in that true social post He likened himself to a boxer who knocked out his opponent He says he knocked out Biden and he will knock and he knocked out vice president Kamala Harris within that second debate Those are his claims The second reason he says is that voters are already voting so that they don't need to have a second debate between him and Vice president Harris voters are not voting yet.
I bet.
"No, i'm good Thank you so much."
"I know we always say it, but it's usually very true, which is why it's important that we make sure that we get our news from sources that cut through the bias so we know what's really going on."
The Democrats need to build a firewall before election day if they're going to survive and win in the 2024 election.
Well this really feels a lot like a festival of sorts you can see the crowd behind me but what you can't see right now is the crowd that extends far beyond our press riser really essentially covered in people I would say tens of thousands of people are here and some from across the country we spoke to someone yesterday who drove an RV all the way from Los Angeles to be here in Butler.
"So again, numbers guy, data guy, let's break this down by the math."
Election day is November 5.
They'll change the name.
"Yeah, they don't, I guess, you know, they don't want us promoting and they're a Democratic party so I get it but they should have like a responsible democracy where we're supporting our old president and you're supporting yours and nobody's making vandalism."
And that Trump hasn't been pushing early voting enough.
"He was in favor of lifting the ban, the cap on salt, which in essence gives tax breaks to millionaire homeowners in California, New York, at the expense of Pennsylvania taxpayers."
"So you can't, you know, dissect one poll."
I've heard it many different ways at this point.
"These states are crucial to the path to victory for any presidential candidate, and Trump's favorable position in these polls could significantly enhance his chances of winning the presidency."
"Historically, mail-in ballots have been a significant source of Democratic votes, and any reduction in the number of valid ballots could favor Trump's campaign."
And so you're getting an opportunity to see the best side of American for the young people here.
And wonderfully honest.
"They would, so like you see, you can never win with these people."
So that's the right decision for Vice President Harris to make.
Now I don't know if you're there.
We welcome everybody and we're here to show that support today.
The Democrats were less organized here.
"By successfully defending these requirements, Trump can argue that his campaign is actively working to ensure fair elections."
You just can't.
And Harris beats Trump in this poll by three points.
The same thing goes for Wisconsin.
"And in terms of turnout, Donald Trump, you got to get that turnout operation going."
I don't need their protection.
I could also tell you it's worth noting the crowd.
And it says Trump that bitch?
The hears his campaign is calling Trump's positions unpopular and damaging.
"These counties voted for like Al Gore and John Kerry, for crying out loud."
That's the bad news.
Here's Roseanne Barr taking a shot at Fox News.
I don't exactly understand these people's logic when it comes down to these primaries like we explained Pennsylvania very well.
Anything worth having is worth fighting for.
Trump has a pretty good shot at winning back some other states.
You have many of folks who are still in Vice President Harris' camp.
A lot of black males are not into the Harris campaign.
I made a commitment during my campaign that I was going to appoint a pro-democracy Secretary of State.
"NBC's Peter Alexander has that, plus a new controversy swirling around Trump."
"By God, I'll tell you, it's a means of supply and what they're running around here complaining in this and it's these radicals."
And look at that deal.
I really don't know what the Harris campaign does if they lose Pennsylvania.
And Laura is here with us in studio alongside Lisa Desjardins.
It's going to be it could be more could be less but right now the tracking is not good for Democrats and it's going to accelerate eventually.
You should see the ads on our television station.
You had somebody who supports gun control that won like an R plus 20 district.
"Now expanding to the largest lead we've seen in these three states, according to new polls here, that's good news for the Democratic Party."
"Well, you're my name is Derek."
"This is not only leading, but expanding the lead in a way that we haven't seen for Joe Biden in a really long time."
"I mean, do you see a strategy to the way he's campaigning?"
"Kamala Harris not only tweeting about it, but she played one of these gaff reels at a rally in Pennsylvania."
"Winning by like kind of resetting the narrative around these particular this particular set of, you know, issue sets."
That's a better deficit for Harris than it was with Joe Biden on the issue of the economy.
"So the lapse began, unfortunately, at the top and on the ground."
After all Philadelphia is one of the few counties in Pennsylvania that shifted right from 2016 to 2020.
It's really 50 50.
We have nothing to do with this.
And Trump won this poll by one point.
It's correctly called the next president three out of four times since 2008.
You've got to uncross those fingers.
I heard Trump give me his inaugural speech.
Trump is going to be strong in Pennsylvania.
"Elon Musk donating nearly $75 million, I understand Jake, from his political action committee to support the Trump campaign."
"So the fact that he's leading in nearly every single poll should tell you there is some kind of a shift and you could talk about the midterms and polls, whatever."
This poll is within the margin of error.
"Harris has struggled to attract independence, of course, swing voters and non college educated voters, which have been a harder sell for her to make."
US election explained every Monday and Thursday only on first post.
"In a statement, national campaign manager, Julie Rodriguez said that Harris's ground game and outreach are stronger than Trump's and we're aggressively crisscrossing the state."
"With its 20 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is a coveted prize for both major political parties."
The intense focus on Pennsylvania in the lead-up to the 2024 election underscores the state's significance in shaping the future of American politics.
What is up people the internet it is me real American back in with a new video today.
 the assassination attempt against former president Trump.
It's very good work for the people that Kamala Harris traditionally doesn't give a shit about.
I remember the debate performance.
"But the question, are these candidates truly on board with the MAGA agenda or just looking to get Trump's seal of approval and the spoils that come with it?"
"So how do you think this whole thing, especially for those on the fence about Trump, plays into all of that?"
"In the Redfield and Wilton strategies poll also conducted between September 16th and 19th, we see another tie with Harris and Trump each securing 47%."
We're a failing nation.
"The suburban shift in voter sentiment, which has become increasingly pronounced in recent election cycles, suggests that moderate and independent voters in these areas are essential to any democratic strategy."
"Access to capital is one of the strongest barriers to starting your own small business, and he will eliminate that."
Trump is on track.
"He has been a champion for America's work in families from passing universal breakfast and lunch in Minnesota, helping to help him bring down the cost of insulin to fighting for manufacturing jobs and working people."
They're just saying how they're going to bring down prices for the everyday American.
"This time, a group of young space colonists discovers a derelict space station."
We are looking at the number of early votes already cast in the states that allow early voting.
Vance doesn't have the ability to appeal to the average voter.
"But after that, she cannot lose a single state."
"Especially in 2016, Democrats held their convention in Philadelphia."
"And honestly Oz may be the lesser of two evils between those two, but that's not enough in my opinion."
Do we want an administration that is based on that type of non-integrity?
"It's like, right there."
A lot of the people who are uncertain at this time are not going to vote based on intricate policy issues.
"So once Bloomberg gets knocked out, although there's going to be probably more Bloomberg polls that come in, that's, that's going to be annoying, but I don't think it's going to be Harris plus five."
Donald Trump Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged.
 Kamala's operation is being poorly run in the nation's biggest battleground.
And we're gonna analyze this endorsement.
"It's not the popular vote, it's the electoral college."
"OK, now it's starting to look."
Here's the biggest reason.
"Well, I really think the people that are supporting Donald Trump had been with Donald Trump throughout."
"And so I think Kamala Harris needs to make sure she's continuing to fight these legal matters right now and then obviously being prepared for what happens later, what comes later."
As you can tell I am not a black man.
"In the fifth poll, conducted by the New York Times and Siena College from August 6th to 9th, with 693 registered voters, Harris received 49% of the vote, while Trump received 46%."
"Yeah, I guess."
"So massive, massive, massive gains that the Trump team has still yet to combat and still yet to see any type of boost in their own battleground states."
Do you really believe?
"And so to see this massive, massive overturn from where it was before, again, day of the dropout, we saw Kamala Harris down nearly 20 points nationally."
Walz's ability to connect with voters on a personal level has been instrumental in his success as governor of Minnesota.
Look at this on the first day of the request.
We also have a key governor's race there.
Is Kamala Harris going to be the next president of the United States of America?
"That's a data question, a statistic."
"And Kathy Barnett, actually, who started off her political career by being the Kim Klasek of Pennsylvania, she ran in a deep blue district, but she's actually ran a solid campaign on the issue."
She's also expected to potentially sit down with the National Association of Black Journalists as early as next week.
"I mean, all these carts full of books, they had at least eight of these carts."
"And they're doing so because they're under assault on campaign commercials that are running on radio, TV and social media, in which Vice President Harris outlines her plans and is very specific about the things that she will do."
"It's kind of like a test, you know?"
"Both candidates have poured more money, time and effort into Pennsylvania than anywhere else."
I can't see anybody else.
And the good news is Kamala Harris is ready to do the job.
They don't tell you that part.
That's where these Republicans make a huge mistake.
He's straight up.
Rural voters in Pennsylvania have been a key part of Trump's coalition.
"Yeah, I'm I'm not too sure."
This requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges their struggles while promoting a forward-looking agenda that addresses economic and social issues in a meaningful way.
Americans don't wanna vote because they think it's rigged.
"But again, even that shows a terrible lapse of response."
There's only so many police officers that can go around to help folks as far as that's concerned.
"And Terry, one more thing, if you don't mind, I want to drill down on this idea of Pennsylvania and some of these Republican heavy counties, because the Trump strategy is to run up the vote totals in places like where he is now in Johnstown, which can be a swingish city, but it's in a county that's heavily Republican and it's surrounded by counties that are heavily Republican."
It's not just Trafalgar.
She came to talk about economic challenges and what a Harris administration would do to improve their lives.
I know originally it was Joe Biden who was the Democrats pick But then they swapped out Kamala Harris after a bad debate performance by Biden.
And that's what Kamala Harris is doing.
"And in terms of who it's going to be, he also says that there are a lot of options on the table and he hasn't necessarily made up his mind yet."
via the homeland security.
That was the largest margin of victory for any Democratic Senate candidate in Pennsylvania's history.
"No, I'm not disappointed maggot."
He's also the chairman of the House Task Force on the attempted assassination of former President Trump.

"However, Trump's appeal to this demographic isn't the slam dunk it used to be."
We've seen a lot of support from the Republican party for our cookies.
"I'm sure there's some things that we would disagree on policy wise, but I think what most Americans feel is a deep commitment to this country and a desire to do right by this country."

We don't vote for Biden.
"If you guys did enjoy this video, smash the like button down below, subscribe, share with your friends, hit that little bell, follow the social media accounts in the description down below and of course, join the channel today."

"And then Donald Trump's like, all right, let's play the song."
We're going to win the election.
So it could be a strategic vote.
"If you can see the setup behind me, he's going to be moderate."
"There's a lot of enthusiasm since Kamala Harris got into the race for you know getting out and voting for her, but I think people are very you know concerned it's such a close race."

They're holding a rally for Harris in the swing state of Pennsylvania.
"She could still lose, but she will still be in a position."
It's about tariffs.
"And we still got, you know, 73 more odd days until election day."
There are seven in all.
Great song.
Democrats need a firewall of about 390 votes to feel okay that they have a good enough shot of winning the state of Pennsylvania.
And Jake Rosen here with me in Studio 57 with the latest on the Trump campaign.
Early voting in the Keystone state is painting a fascinating picture with Democrats surging ahead.

The reason that happens is because they run up crazy margins in liberal states like California and New York.
This is a prosperous area in many respects.
"You're seeing more Trump polls coming in, which is obviously great."

"Since Biden has no longer been on the ticket, that question has gone away, even though we have one of the oldest candidates running for president still on the ballot."
And now look what Iran is doing.
 Kamala Harris just can't catch a break.
She was all in on banning fracking and shoving the Green New Deal down America's throat.
"They both lean Democratic, but really close margins here, and every vote is going to count."

"Harris's ability to forge meaningful connections with various voter blocs, articulate a compelling economic vision that addresses diverse concerns, and effectively leverage sentiment analysis in her campaigning will be of utmost importance."

"So former president Donald Trump was injured in a, by a UDA Saturday evening during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, trigger man and at least one audience member are unalived."
That would be the equivalent.
I can't even get it out.
"Personally, if you have an America First candidate that's like ethnically Turkish as an Armenian, I don't really care."
He knows about it.
"So these counties may not even be direct bellwethers, but the fact that Donald Trump is, you know, starting to turn a little bit of a corner in these bellwether counties, that's good news for him."
"And I'll tell you what I told him, I thought what he did was really honorable that he put country first, that he stood as a patriot."
Is it possible?
She's the current VP What do you think about how her and Joe Biden are running the country?
"It was great, I'm not lying."
So the polling was one point left.
Maybe she's wrong.
"So there is a good poll, one good poll for Trump."

One issue which stands in stark contrast to Republicans' professed agenda is that they have been openly hostile to IVF.
"So that means less voters for Donald Trump, more voters overall, that's going to add to the overall number."
These are slim margins in the battleground states.
It's real bad.
How is he going to fix that?
It's crazy.
So that is something that has been shown to be a particular interest within that community.
"It's a little bit outdated, but every single day Republicans have gone up."
The reality of the matter is that generally hasn't happened.
It was great.
It's only 53 percent say amnesty for CNN.
What Obama meant was that the Democratic Party is seeing a slump in support for Kamala Harris among black men and that it was a major concern in the upcoming presidential election.
What do you make of him talking about the enemy within?
"Let's be frank, okay?"
"Perhaps most of all, Carlos sees the working class at stake."
"And we are even advertising in a newspaper article to 16,000 federal firearms license organizations and companies."
Just put on music for 52 minutes and just sit.
"You mean those voters who maybe don't want to say who they're voting for out loud, but then when they're in that voting booth?"
"If you will recall, Donald Trump won all the electoral votes in Pennsylvania in the 2016 US presidential elections by a margin of 0.72 percent."
He's pointing out her flip flop and even warning during the last debate that fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one if she's elected.
"The ninth poll was conducted between September 20th and 24 by Beacon Research, Shaw and Company Research among 1,021 registered voters."
"Now, I should be clear that when it comes to voter registration in many states, especially Pennsylvania, you have to be careful because it can be misleading."
"If you're a Republican, don't get too anxious yet because Republicans are expected to not vote early."
"JD Vance was really just dog water in terms of the possibilities that he could have, you know, who he chose, and what ended up happening."
"So yeah, I was with Josiah and we like, okay, let's go to the Donald Trump rally."
"Yeah, you know, we'll see if that happens."
"Well, it needs to be about the issues."
"It just feels like, bro, everything just feels so iffy, bro, like who do you even believe?"
"If Trump can run up a big margin and Westmoreland County, Butler County, Greene County, those counties, and that if he can run up a big enough margin in the Carl account counties of Pittsburgh, he has a shot at it."
They're not going to have anything.
"Not even a month remaining for November 5th, the day that Super Tuesday when the Americans vote to elect their new president."
There really is no in between.
"70, 75% of people support this."
There's momentum for Harris.
"No, first one."
The fact that she came down in the middle of the city to talk to people at the community college for me was the most positive thing.
"Crime in general and especially migrant crime are at the forefront of voters' minds, as are taxes and the economy."
"Even if they released a Biden plus three poll, they wouldn't exactly, you know, bat an eye at it or they would be like, haha, this is proof."
"Well, it's not."
I'm going to suggest that that is probably the moment where things really started to go sideways.
"You can see when it was a Biden versus Trump rematch, we saw that Biden was down nationally, two, three points on average."
You really care about me even though.
"Joining me today is the Center Squares Pennsylvania reporter, Anthony Hennon."
"Thank you, Congressman Jolly."
"Vice President Harris is set to speak in Erie tonight, while former President Trump is holding a town hall in a suburb of Philadelphia."
"And a lot of people may think these numbers would have changed after the momentum gained by the DNC, right?"
"You know, very simple act that becomes like a little miracle."
"We've seen the Trump campaign kind of make it push in the last couple of weeks to focus on doing more digital streaming engagements, like podcast shows with very popular hosts."
But like she had things happen to her.
And I derived them through use of polls.
I know what it's like to come from a working class family.
And these companies on their prices and keep pointing out when they're jacking up their prices on food and household items and forcing people to pay higher prices just because they can get away with it because they can unless you have price gouging legislation passed.
"For my friend and your outstanding congressman, Raul Grijalva."
I grew up a middle class kid.
They like his fiscal policy.
He pretended to be Scranton Joe.
I think it's that social media and trans people online are not a monolith.
"I think that's why it's, what does Trump use?"
Let's walk.
The whole thing will be won.
Donald Trump swayed on stage with South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem mimicking his dance moves.
So how do you allow homeownership to happen?
Concept.
Of course and I believe him that he wants to repair this country because this country has been going through a lot in the negative way.
"After addressing the crowds in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump rallied in the battleground state of Wisconsin, where the Republicans said that the state needed liberation from the Democrats."
"Speaking for myself, I do not condone violence in any way, shape or form."
"Her, in her own words, something that ABC Disney could learn from."
We have also grown our support with women tripled and support among white college educated voters in that state.
"And if that happens, Democrats have a really good shot of winning the state of Pennsylvania."
"But Pennsylvania, the one with maybe just a little bit of a lead for the former president, that is critical because the former president would only need to take one of these states."
"Actually, North Carolina was fucked."
"Now with less than a month from election day, what is it that's keeping these undecided voters from knowing for sure, yes, I'm going to vote for Harris or yes, I'm going to vote for Trump?"
"Throughout our history, the leaders of Alpha Kappa Alpha have stood up, spoken out, and done the work to build a brighter future for our nation."
"A history of, for example, something that still exists that I've worked on to address, which is racial bias and home appraisals."
"If only Andrew Jackson had gotten to know more Cherokee or Chickasaw people, he'd never have signed the Indian Removal Act, right?"
Even Pittsburgh.
You had to move your family out of your house for safety?
"And I don't think on election day, it will be Harris plus five."
"This could give Trump a tactical advantage in Pennsylvania, which is a crucial swing state with a significant number of electoral votes."
I'm not sure that Harris has that kind of instincts or experience to know where that is.
Kamala Harris is winning Pennsylvania.
He killed an 11 year old boy.
"He constantly tries to create others in our society, separate people out based on what they look like, where they come from, who they love, who they pray to, and it is something that is deeply offensive, I think, to many people."
"Reason being, a campaign will sponsor a poll, and they very much would like to see slightly more beneficial results than what we see on the actual polls."
"The next thing you want to know is, am I better off than I was four years ago?"
"My husband is also a full-time owner operator of transport in the dry bulk industry, and I also work part-time for a Christian school as the food service director."
"You know, I got a lot of stuff."
"Speaking to a large audience of men and men of color, President Obama urged them to do the right thing and vote for Kamala Harris."
So Pennsylvania that is the choice in this election.
"Those are the things that voters actually care about, and Donald Trump is ranting about conspiracy theories that don't make any sense and that people are actually laughing at when he says them."
The Trump campaign of course had a field day with with that with those remarks there.
"I mean, what you're seeing is the enthusiasm for the vice president in Kamala Harris."
But the biggest shifts came mostly in the Scranton area.
And I have friends.
"He doesn't hold the administration, so he has no power to deploy national guard or the US military, but giving out such threats."
"That where I can't excuse me, Montgomery County."
"You go to certain parts of Western Pennsylvania, his signs are up and there are very few Harris signs."
Sorry.
"He, of course, grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania."
But I'm not going to do so enthusiastically.
Would be an interesting dynamic.
But listen to this.
They called a free talk in Arizona.
"And when she gave her speech, she in very racist terms said the following about Vice President Kamala Harris."
We are so excited about tonight.
These are the only points that can be won.
Election experts raise fresh alarms.
And they had an interview.
And that's with some big outliers.
"If he's around and I'm around, he's straight going to have my attention."
"Now, our playlist would probably be better, but..."
"And of course, you're at the checkout line there."
"Thank you so much for watching The Real News Network, where we lift up the voices, stories and struggles that you care about most."
"The problem, I think, is that that is being massively overshadowed right now by inflation in particular."
"But either way, I would argue that Catholics are a must win group for Trump."
Vance just said on stage just now and so this is kind of a theme throughout this campaign we'll see if the former president sticks to a kind of similar message that he's been talking about on the campaign trail but this is also a sort of homecoming for him here in Butler the campaign had really wanted to make this point of returning here.
"Well, why are you actively trying to make it harder to pass legislation that prevents that potential voter fraud?"
Because I think it was an insurrection caused by Nancy Pelosi.
Must win.
He pays his bills.
"For starters, you're talking about a 300,000 voter drop."
Tell me about yourself and how you came to like Donald Trump.
They had a seven point polling lead for Trump going into the switch and now it's down.
"You know, the Marist poll in Ohio had JD Vance tied in their final poll with Tim Ryan."
And he was tragically killed.
Governor has long been mentioned as a favor to be a potential running mate for Harrison.
"Who are people of color who are sold on their message, you know, just do your own research Try not to be so biased try not to trust and everything that you hear on TV do your own research And once you start doing your own research and going down that rabbit hole You can make an honest opinion based off of that, you know And I feel like everybody deserves a fair chance, but Trump definitely has my attention when it comes to certain things that he talks about and I just like how direct he is and how you know, you know not so He doesn't just bow down to the media and I like that if Kamala Harris were to be elected She'd be the first black female president."
"He has to play, you know, defense but also offense at the same time because you need to protect your lead in these places."
Chase.
"I don't think so, right?"
It's just it's a very close race.
This is why she came out after the election when she lost and she never really got over that or admitted it by the way.
There was another poll from a national pollster CBS.
"Now I should mention, Donald Trump recently posted on Truth Social."
I would say Biden.
She should be up by four to five points.
"The vice president's going to Detroit and then Pittsburgh, where I am later this afternoon."
"That's a lot of fake news back there, too."
What they've done.
Don't expect the government to take care of you.
"And I think as Reuben mentioned, si se puede."
You've got a good breakfast here in front of you I think some French toast and some bacon.
"And then you were at this rally that the new Vice Presidential nominee, Tim Walz, and Vice President participated in Philadelphia and it certainly seemed to be allowed an enthusiastic crowd."
"So, you know, Michigan and the primary Nikki Haley missed by 11 points."
You have a lot of people on the Democrat side who will vote on election day in comparison to the 2020 election.
So it's not a surprise to me that he would want to stay and continue this work.
"So Republicans, in my humble objective opinion, are in the best place possible to actually win Pennsylvania and therefore the presidency this November."
That was the state that decided the 2020 election.
"Would everyone else, even the Washington Post or even Franklin and Marshall, they're finding the race, you know, within the margin of error."
"If I were Trump, frankly, I would not try for Pennsylvania, but but does this no point to it."
I don't forget the insurrection he tried to lead and failed at leading.
"Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Experts, in fact, are predicting that an October surprise could be around the corner, which could change the course of this election."
"People just hit the ground, chairs were toppled."
"So when you take positions like that, you're going to get knocked around as I have."
Great to be with you.
It's a real sliver of Pennsylvania and the country.
"So yeah, I mean, I would say this is normal."
"If Trump's Nebraska rant wasn't enough to make people question his grip on reality, his strange obsession with Oprah Winfrey certainly was."
An angel appears and warns of the coming trumpets.
"But nuclear politics, I'm only using as a point of reference because their website is really strong in comparison to some others, and also tells us a lot about where Biden was and where Harris is now, just as a point of reference, as a point of comparison, but I will say, I do not believe Kamala Harris is up by one point, sorry, Donald Trump is up by 1.8% in Pennsylvania right now, because what we have seen is a massive, massive reduction in terms of support from the past for Trump compared to when he was running against Biden."
"Well, look, it's clearly where the vast majority of Americans are."
"I mean, he he was very successful."
Just install the games on like a external hard drive and you'll have those games forever.
"Ryan Bowyer, who as the first blackhead of the city's building trades council, one of the most powerful labor leaders in the state, this guy says, I have concerns about Nikki Liu."
"I don't know, I'm hopeful."
I want to ask you a little bit about Kamala Harris.
You'll see it's without of the margin of error.
What a moment it was.
No rest for the weary today.
So I like that.
The Detroit economic one.
"These numbers are on par with the national electorate, but in Pennsylvania, these concerns are compounded by the state's divided political landscape."
"I've heard people are driving for hours to buy your cookies in person, or even shipping orders to Alaska and Hawaii."
Looks like we might need an EMT right in front here.
Real strength is about working hard and carrying a heavy load without complaining.
Of course there's been a lot of media coverage of Harris's outreach to black men in particular.
"He was down earlier in the night, but he ended up coming in first."
"We have a new ad out this morning featuring the moment in the debate where the vice president says, when I was a prosecutor, I never asked a victim, whether they were a Republican or a Democrat."
The fourth poll was conducted between September 18 and 20th by RMG Research among 783 likely voters.
Just like a lot of these pollsters from the mainstream media.
"Harris left DC today for Pennsylvania, making a stop at a small business in Johnstown before heading to a rally in Wilkes-Barre tonight."
So there's all different types of voters in Wilkes-Barre.
"I can understand, you know, oh, maybe it's a tight race in Pennsylvania and then Trump's tied in the popular vote."
You cannot lose that scenario.
Here are the top stories making the headlines to the North American region.
I've talked about this before.
"And that's more than likely because he's from this area on paper like, oh, yeah, he's Scranton Joe."
"And what this was supposed to be was a town hall moderated by Christy Noem, where Trump was answering questions from voters in Pennsylvania."
"It was Biden plus five, Clinton plus seven, plus eight."
"In 2016, when Trump won both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and indeed if we looked at the analysis, county by county, the Polish vote clearly in 2016 helped Trump a great deal in claiming victory."
But the likelihood of turnout lags than that of white voters.
"And with Donald Trump's proposal today, look, I know a lot of guys in the energy sector that work in either oil or gas, and they work in 80 hour weeks, sometimes even more."
"Unlike the previous poll, this poll was conducted only between Trump and Harris."
They're covering him.
Harris tonight responding.
So that's why you guys are out here or is that permit for in there or just generally the city?
"But regardless of what either person would not be running the country, it'd be the staff behind them."
"On the South side, you have the mainline, old school, traditional."
"Like, how's it looking?"
There's some negative comments that I try to control my best.
"It is so close that we don't know how it's going to go, right?"
"So it's not like Quinnipiac is really the strongest pollster, especially in the Rust Belt."
"Cafe Versailles in Little Havana, as you know, it is a stopping ground for every presidential candidate and really shapes the narrative on that issue as well."
"So the focus on Pennsylvania at this time is critical because of everything that we have seen, but also in terms of this law."
mandate?
"You have unstable blades wobbling around as you shave, which causes the irritation."
"Thank you very much as well, man."
ABC's congressional correspondent Rachel Scott is at the midterm monitor with more.
47% voted for Donald Trump.
So I know exactly how this will go down.
And that's it.
"Well, that's really not just a Tim Waltz thing."
"Right now, polling there shows that Vice President Kamala Harris leads among young voters."
"Oh, right."
I put a truth.
"If people feel like they're not being heard, then... You can't justify this."
"So that book in particular is very, very good."
"And right now there have been 416,000 votes cast in the state of Pennsylvania."
A one point swing in Wisconsin and Michigan means Trump is president of the United States.
"Because he figured that if you passed it, he would not be able to engage in the same kind of fear mongering that he's been doing."
"And look, I mean, we can make light of it."
That's the phrase I want you to remember.
"But either way, what's more likely these undecided voters to break for Trump or break for Harris?"
"When you look at the polling, match it up against 2016."
I'm making another video with you.
"Senator Casey was only for one exception, which was life in the mind."
It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it.
"And the one thing that there is actually evidence about, as far as best practices for security and stuff like that, the people who are debating about it, they're debating on the very last thing in a string of things to go wrong."
The Democratic Party has a really unique point to where they have been able to change the way people perceive their candidates months out from the election.
"How's it going to act, is that family influence?"
You're just going to be spinning your wheels.
"Again, I put this in a video, went out last night."
But Trump still has many pathways to winning.
Everybody leans a certain way.
And are they going to how are they going to divvy this up?
So of course that was a vice president there reacting to those comments.
"I mean, I don't know."
"Biden, sorry, rather, Trump was up four points against Kamala Harris."
And that becomes the center and the just the normal and the average.
And Ace.
And that's assuming there's no polling miss.
"It's 19 votes without it, Democrats will lose the election."
"In 2016, many suburban voters, particularly in areas like Macomb County, shifted towards Trump."
What I have seen is that we can we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.
"Biden has been spending a lot of time in the state, a lot of money in the state, but still according to two recent polls, he's not really in a very good position right now."
"Trump's attacks on Harris drew mixed reactions from the crowd, with some cheering enthusiastically while others remained silent."
I don't deny that Pennsylvania will be a close state.
Mr. Brenneman.
What are you going to do for them?
"And many of his content that go on X, his own social media platform have been questioned."
Thanks for taking this deep dive with us.
I was about to say he sounded like a regular.
"In 10 seconds, Trump was put on the floor by Secret Service and they protected him from the shooter."
"You know Western, Pennsylvania I'd love to hear what you think should be focused on I Think that's a very stark choice, and I think all of those things are embedded in that you know if you really if democracy is Important to you of course you know you know vice president Harris is going to be who you choice if you're talking about reproductive freedom for women of course obviously you're going to you're going to choose the vice president and if you're concerned about is somebody going to try to have an insurrection and and and Claim about you know rigged elections and things so definitely you're going to vote for for Harrison things But but that's why I can't understand why I personally would vote for that But I know a lot of people that are in an absolutely going to vote for Donald Trump and spend any time all across in small County, Pennsylvania You see a lot of support and there's a lot of energy there for Trump And I want people to understand that it's it's true And it's there and if we don't take it very seriously Then we do it our own peril on that the same message that I would have had Back the secretary Clinton, and I would like to remind the secretary Clinton She beat Trump in all three debates I was actually in the audience of that first debate and he absolutely Wooked him, but that really wasn't determinative in that race sadly Yeah, and so I want everybody to do on this I do believe that Harris is going to win and Trump is going to have a strong performance, too But I do not think it's going to change the underlying dynamic that I've already been discussing That it's since 2016 a senator John Federman."
Joining me today is the Center Squares Pennsylvania reporter Anthony Hennen.
"But with this cooperation agreement, Ellis signed Monday."
"And as for those workers right, the whole essence of Trump's Make America Great Again really economically rests on his notion that America should make things again, manufacture this part of America, obviously, with the steel mills, which left 40 years ago there."
You know what the problem is?
"This is so bad that if Donald Trump would have taken Democrats' advice, and I'm sure most of us realize that he's using the whole COVID thing as a way to say Donald Trump's a terrible president because when he left office, of course COVID was raging and you had all his, his economy got destroyed because of it."
"No, not really."
"You take somebody who's familiar to the region, you replace them with a liberal nut job from California who's been on record flip-flopping on something like fracking and, you know, co-sponsored the initial Green New Deal."
They don't know where she stands on anything.
But those aren't the people I'm talking about today.
It could come down to the wire.
He must win to preserve democracy in America.
"The sixth poll was conducted between September 12th and 16 by Quinnipiac University among 1,331 likely voters."
"Really appreciate your down the middle approach, calling balls and strikes on both sides."
How's that for all you senior citizen voters?
But she's run a fairly flawless campaign so far and still isn't budging.
"This, as CBS News polling, shows a razor-thin edge between both of them."
"Of course, Democrats, to even keep 50 50 control of the Senate, they have to hold on to Pennsylvania."
Does that typically boost sales when one of the candidates says something like that?
"Yeah, everyone's pumped."
We get to do something about it.
"You are the first person of Arab descent to be elected mayor of Dearborn, which I think might be surprising to some people, given that Dearborn is a majority, you know, Arab-Muslim city."
"Then somebody like Kamala Harris, who is being branded and successfully branded as an out of touch San Francisco liberal."
"For the presidential race, it's 390,000 votes."
"They offered her the best deal of all, which is dropping the charges again, incredibly rare."
What's Joe Biden going to do?
They don't poll.
"It taps into the worst aspects of xenophobia and racism, encouraging division and hatred in a country already grappling with these issues."
I think we're a model for the rest of the country.
I want to interview you guys.
"According to Nate Silver's election model, Pennsylvania is far and away the most important battleground this year, with a whopping 32% chance of tipping the election."
"And we all know that there's been a lot of ministries doing this and I would encourage you to keep on doing it, keep on preaching it, keep on telling people about the Lord and what's about to take place."
But here she is.
He's confused.
"Joe Watkins, a former White House aide to George H.W."
Passions were so high that one resident we spoke to says he avoids talking about politics altogether.
"Let's hit a few other topics now, Kayla."
And it is a bare minimum.
This reflects a long-term trend of shrinking middle class over the past five decades.
"I'll give them that, like when you ride along the highway or anywhere, here in Virginia, I wouldn't say it's as common, but there, I mean every house, if whoever they're supporting, they're there, there does seem to be a lot of neighborliness, so that's good, people respect each other, but it was fascinating for me to see it like in action of what it really looks like in the hardcore swing state for, right before an election."
"Remember, you know, you want to know CNN, MSNBC, they had the death counters up where they would count how many people would die."
And I think you will see Donald Trump gain.
"But you go a little bit further out, you know, maybe even your more rural areas of Gwinnett County."
"And you see it on this question, too, on our Biden's policies, the Biden administration policies helping or hurting your family."
"Well, I heard there was a guy there."
But let's take Pennsylvania out of Kamala Harris's column and put him in a Donald Trump's column.
Why?
He would not vote for Trump a third time.
"Osman, let's bring you in now."
"And sort of going with this notion of dual loyalty that Jews only have to care about Israel, and by the way, have to have the exact same views on Israel, I think is deeply offensive and deeply troublesome."
"Online debates are heating up, and it's clear that digital engagement could be a deciding factor."
It's beyond ridiculous.
Donald Trump has been convicted of a felony.
"But do you really think with pollsters like Bloomberg, Quinnipiac and the New York Times posting their shit that they're going to be right?"
It could.
The officials are saying it's at capacity.
"And what we're gonna do here, check this out, this is incredibly, again, Heels Up can't win if she hasn't won PA."
Central PA. Show you all the Donald Trump stuff.
"Okay, Nishimara, Mishimara."
Made in the USA?
"You should see roughly the same margin, but you don't you see the opposite you see Republicans gaining percentage-wise and it's getting worse for Democrats with each pass today."
 US What's up YouTube this is 2raw4TV.
"She goes to the border, as literal borders are, and doesn't really want to take questions from journalists, of course, about this."
Is there going to be cheating going on?
This is a really really big deal for the race Because again even like the smallest of a margin if you have two percent 1.5 votes time and then you get point four and Trump gets point one.
She's answering questions.
"What does that have to do about good policies, effective policies that work for our country?"
"I'm originally from Brooklyn, New York."
Big problems there.
Kamala Harris is proving to be a far more competent and stronger candidate than many thought.
"But Shapiro, I think whoever she chooses to be a good, uh, good person to go alongside her."
Donald Trump's back ahead.
"Because three weeks ago, when he dropped out of the race, he was down in Pennsylvania quite tremendously."
Trump then says he will have a peace deal when he's still president elect.
"Pennsylvania has long been considered not only a battleground state, but perhaps the key battleground state in this election."
But what's the excuse for Quinnipiac or even The New York Times?
This is from Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Molloy quote three crucial swing states wave a red flag at the Trump campaign the GOP is most go to attack strategies against Democrats on immigration and the economy may be losing momentum.
"And he already did that in 2020 he lost 60 court cases, but it didn't seem to matter and everybody in the last resort was to have this This insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th but my fear is that November could be just as This would be the nice word for just as raucous as it was in 2020, right?"
"Of course, for people watching that haven't been there, a key caller County where Democrats have seen a lot of pickup from maybe Republicans who have had a lot of conversations about this taste for Trump."
"In this case, Donald Trump, who wants to further restrict and limit our freedoms."
"Turnout's going to drop across the board, but will it drop more on the left than on the right?"
While the Vice President enjoys support from women and women of color.
"But yeah, there just seemed to be a kind of strange lack of focus from his campaign."
"We're living in you know what I'm saying, but when I say that I want to make it clear I'm not saying that that was fake, but you best believe in the blogosphere in this internet era Individuals are most definitely saying that here We go everybody with the Donald Trump staged a shooting just to win the election First of all Donald Trump would definitely stage a shooting with fake blood and all that just to win the election Absolutely, I agree with that But think about it He would have to fake out the CIA the United States government is going to take every resource and asset They're going to make sure that this was real if it was fake they're gonna find out So you'd have to know that I am a fake out the CIA."
"Bob, I want you to stand by just for a moment."
We just energized.
Trump is at 52 percent.
I know he's asserted this to constituents of yours in various ways.
She looks like the most beautiful actress ever to live.
"He says, well, eight or maybe even nine of the keys should go to Donald Trump under your schema and it seems rather random, rather..."
So the reason I think it's important to talk about this is you know we're just a couple weeks out from Election Day and if if Trump manages to win the White House if they flip the Senate even if they don't hold on to the House you know there would be a lot of really interesting fascinating conversations in the GOP about about trade and economic policy and of course foreign policy.
And it is incumbent on me to earn the support.
"Saw him here in Erie, Pennsylvania, before."
I ain't gonna lie.
"Trump drowning in conspiracy theories and self-pity versus Harris, who remains committed to tackling the country's pressing issues."
" Well, the focus today is on the state of Pennsylvania."
It should.
So is this only for black entrepreneurs or is this for all entrepreneurs?
Everybody knows that everyone sees through it.
It's basically the same.
I actually looked back at my Walmart purchases from previous years.
So don't come to me with that.
That's Biden and Harris.
"However, 2016, four years later, Hillary Clinton loses it by 21%."
She also unveiled a new ad that features some of his former national security aides basically saying that so that she it is a notable and more aggressive take from the vice president.
That's his definition of freedom.
Former President Donald Trump is holding a town hall with Latino voters.
But clearly there was a serious lapse in the plan and a serious lapse in an execution.
"It is me, Real American, back again with a new video, and today, we have to talk about the 2024 presidential election, because brand new data suggests that Donald Trump's on pace for victory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania."
More than half of them registered as unaffiliated voters.
"I will liberate Wisconsin and our entire nation from this mass migration invasion of murderers, child predators, drug dealers, gang members and thugs."
That is exactly true.
And then Trump undercut his lawyer because his lawyer that would also be incriminating him.
"Why is it so impo people to vote, especiall of this election?"
Democrats had roughly 1.1 million.
"How you doing, Bob?"
"I did get a little bit nervous when we have found out that Trump was gonna be running again, but when they had kind of did that switcheroo and had Kamala come in, it kind of gave a lot more hope for what was coming."
Plus the only part that you replace is the blade itself.
I cannot vote for Trump because I just can't.
"As we consider it, what Joe was talking about, this notion that we're seeing changes in the way voters feel about the economy or how the economy would fare under these candidates and Harris more favorably."
"He said and I think as we get closer people get more tense, you know, they're even more vocal."
"Oh, yeah, everybody's motivated."
Here is the response that she gave.
Jill Stein's run for president for 25 fucking years.
"You have to win through Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin."
You talk about the Philly suburbs.
"There are some Democrats being very vocal, others speaking on background, but they're worried about Harris's momentum."
It's really is really powerful.
"The way he's been thinking about tariffs and trade now, something's a little bit lost."
"By the way, we got millions of more votes in 20 that we did 16."
"All of a sudden, nobody likes him."
And eventually that he failed when it went up against Federman.
"And then when Hillary Clinton came in, she went all the way down to 37 with Joe Biden at about 40% of the votes in 2020."
Huh?
This is all spongible money.
We're still a retail state.
We just... That's all we can tell you.
But this election will be decided in the key battleground states where the race is also essentially tied.
Or was this pretty much what you were expecting?
The enemy from within are more dangerous than Russia.
Donald Trump gets lost telling a story about marble columns.
That number is just 58 percent for Vice President Harris.
"Meanwhile, other big names are also hitting the campaign trail."
Watch his rallies.
 President Biden will travel to Pennsylvania today for a campaign rally in his hometown of Scranton.
"I paint just for, you know, kind of fun."
And I had one source tell me that Trump doesn't need these voters.
"One of the attorneys the campaign added is Mark Elias, who will be joining the team to specifically focus on possible recount efforts."
Like what are you doing?
It would kill him.
And then you've also got stuff in Nevada and Michigan.
"Moving forward to the sixth poll, on the same, which was also conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, with different with 693 likely voters, Harris received 50% of the vote, while Trump received 46%, and Harris leads the poll by four points."
"I mean, even when Republicans didn't do so well in 2022."
"So they're saying Biden is going, man, listen, listen, like I said, they are definitely blaming the Democratic Party on this one."
"Now, look, it's going to be tough."
"But in terms of the electorate, it is true that we just have to keep breaking it down using the swingometer."
And the Rasmussen poll has Trump plus three and that's going to have to be inputted because they do input that they put in.
"And you know, you can have someone that says, hey, I have your casserole dish."
That really?
Now we are talking about the unthinkable potentially former President Trump on stage as shots ring out here in Butler County Pennsylvania.
When it comes to the issues that are driving voters' decisions.
"Nearly 61,000 people have registered to vote in North Carolina since Biden stepped out of the race."
"Of the vote that the Democrats will get in the election, 44% of that will come from Philadelphia and the suburban counties around Philadelphia."
"I guess that's a majority, but do you really think that every new voter Republicans are gaining?"
"Okay, Hunter Woodall, thanks so much for your perspective on this."
But it was a statement that is much more painful to get because they're oftentimes in very bad shape.
"It's hack, Liso."
"The most interesting part of the Pew report is finding that the middle class is shrinking, not only because more people are poor, but also because more people are rich."
"That is really good news for Kamala Harris and also just goes to show that these are pollsters that come from very different backgrounds, very different funding sources, very different methodologies in understanding the Pennsylvania electorate."
West 71 was fighting to get his name added to the candidate roster in the battleground state before Pennsylvania begins early voting and mail-in voting in the coming weeks.
So thank you for joining my channel.
"Bob, to almost every time was one of the ones who would stand up in that room with all the other senators from around the country talking about the working people of Pennsylvania and why we needed to have you in our mind when we were thinking about national policy every single day."
"This part of the state is about one third, 33% of the overall electorate in the state."
It's a Republican idea that's been out there for several years.
This will be a barn burner.
Trump's base is highly motivated by issues related to election integrity.
And so we will start to see more and more money go into that.
So the Kennedy campaign has been a disaster from the very beginning.
"Specifically, the court rejected a challenge brought by Democratic officials aimed at eliminating the mandate that mail-in ballots must be dated and submitted by certain deadlines."
And so you will find that this Democratic sponsored poll probably is misleading in the sense that Kamala Harris is probably not up four points in Pennsylvania.
"Well, there are a lot of words."
"Wisconsin, I would say it's similar to Pennsylvania."
It's a little bit tough.
But now Europe is just they're up our asses.
"Now, of course, he is not the president, doesn't have any control over the military right now, but it is this kind of heightened rhetoric that we're seeing in the closing weeks of the campaign."
A friendly couch named J.D.
An area that has seen an influx of new residents from Puerto Rico in recent years.
"So you go to Pennsylvania, you set up shop there, and what do you do?"
"Alright, so Kamala Harris wins the electoral college when she wins the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
We'd have to find common ground.
"And what what her campaign is saying is the more she talks about it, the better she is doing on this and more so that you talk to voters and they're becoming increasingly familiar with her."
But here are the latest overnight results.
"Appreciate you, Jay."
It's not just the Latinos latinx community that they're struggling with maybe because they keep calling them latinx.
Trumpy Trout is the greatest fish I've ever caught.
"Yeah, you have to reload."
Bar earrings are all the rage.
And every single data driven forecast out there gives Trump or Harris a better than 90% chance of winning them.
"That based on their numbers with Joe Biden is a six point swing, 4.5 percent to 2.3 nearly seven point swing from where Biden was against Trump."
So there's Harris on the one hand.
Now recently of course price increases have moderated considerably but as you know prices don't go back down typically and so people still are not accustomed to the sticker shock they get at the supermarket.
"Wow, AWOL, away without leave."
They met a woman who actually believes they are controlling the weather.
My street was rock ribbed Republican.
It is good to be back.
"The Harris campaign has been in Georgia, I think three of the last four days."
So I'm calling on Congress to pass this bill against my desk immediately.
A little bit.
"Now, I'm not saying it's impossible for Harris to win Pennsylvania, but the only polls that have are winning as of now are Bloomberg, which is by born in Consult and Quinnipiac."
Do you care?
Vance had in that VP debate a few weeks ago.
"Now, later in the day today, the former American president Barack Obama is expected to rally for the Democrat presidential nominee."
Vance so they're fired up their energized and they're just waiting for him to take the stage to finish what he couldn't finish on July 13.
And the shtick is getting old.
They were super excited about him being on the ticket.
but you really need to If you look for truth You have to find for it not by just hearing it To follow up on that many people in the media call Trump racist Have you heard this stuff and do you believe any of that?
It's free advertising.
"My goodness, thank God he did fail on January 6th."
"But unlike Kamala Harris, I think Trump needs Pennsylvania."
Here's just a little bit of like chump change for you.

"Oh my gosh, they got the military in there."
It's going to be huge.
"And this time is there were reports that he will be going back to Butler, Pennsylvania."
But I also want to note that Minnesota has a history of producing Democratic vice presidents.
"Which is the whole point of what's going on here because as politically, a political analyst would say, it is the undecided people who will decide the direction Pennsylvania goes."
There's no denying that Pennsylvania is the key to this election.
It's still one of the states that he leads in but it's down to two and a half points.
"And I know you could argue that's a different pollster, but the Washington Post was involved with this poll and they found Biden up by seven."
"Only once in the past four presidential elections, Donald Trump's victory in 2016, did fewer than 90 percent of Pennsylvania's black voters support the Democratic nominee."
We're going to be spending a lot more time in Pennsylvania.
"And again, I'm getting phone calls from close immediate family members saying they're trapped or they have been killed or they have been injured."
"You know, we got these wonderful feel-good Olympics."

Certainly a lot of their mail-in voter base.
"But Kamala Harris as the opposition to Joe Biden, not opposition, but the alternative to Joe Biden does far better."
It's a real key win.
They are good.
"And yet when Donald Trump lies or cheats or bullies or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls service members like John McCain losers because they died in battle or were captured, when he calls fellow citizens vermin or the enemy within, people make excuses for it."
"And look, this is a moment where leaders in their party, including David McCormick, he's the Republican nominee running for the United States Senate in Pennsylvania."
"Fight, fight, fight."
"In fact, this number suggested New Hampshire was gonna be far more competitive, Maine was gonna be far more competitive, Minnesota, which is now not competitive at all, was gonna be far more competitive."
What's critical for both campaigns is turnout.
"So, as we gear up for this monumental election, remember that your vote matters."
We have no incentive to stop spying because of that shit.
And we will make America great again.
"And all signs are kind of pointing to Pennsylvania being the key here, right?"
But it's really important and we're going to turn this country around.

I don't.
She's changing the perception.
"The seventh poll was conducted between September 12th and 16 by the Washington Post among 1,003 likely voters."

"It's dead even not only nationally, but in these battleground states."
"A lot of people in Pennsylvania, that whole ordeal, he has a special place in the hearts of many Americans."

"As for the Republican leader, his campaign fund currently stands at a measly three hundred and eight million dollars in comparison with Kamala Harris's war chest, which is way far behind his political rival."
I honestly think that he used to understand how tariffs work.

Some of them are from North Carolina.
"Tensions with China, Pennsylvania is a state with a large manufacturing industry, and trade wars with China have directly impacted the state's economy."
And so it looked like Donald Trump was unbeatable that this election would be one and done.
"I think in terms of the policy and kind of where the country is going right now, you know, I'll favor him."
They're all trying to come back to that question of who's fighting for you and providing voters with an answer that Democrats and Republicans are doing just that.
What's the latest in terms of his messaging and some of the fallout?
And we know that he has a long history of attacking pollsters when he disagrees with the results.

There's no reason for hate.
"We know it's going to be close and the way you win in Pennsylvania is putting in the hard work, clearly articulating your views and your values to the good people of Pennsylvania and giving them the opportunity to come together Democrat, Republican and Independent behind your candidacy."
"I said, he's one of the dumbest human beings ever."

Here's Greg Price over on X.
Okay so this is the state of Pennsylvania and these are all of their counties and congressional districts so what you see with all of these little kind of jaggedy lines and everything these are the boundaries around each of the counties so here's here here here here here here here here and so forth.
"We want, you know, our children to thrive."
That would be a major decrease in what many households are paying on childcare.
That I think would be the easiest way to victory.
Trump has virtually no chance in the Commonwealth.
"You'd call up your cousins and you'd say, have you noticed?"
It's not so bad.
Listen to this exchange.
Trump is in a heavily Republican area of a version of a part of that state.
"And the reason for that, sure, can be fair."
We're your people.
"So I mean, the concerns are very similar to to other voters."
The first is a town hall.
"Yeah, she's flip flopped on a lot of issues related to energy."
"Well, after months of really getting slammed for not doing interviews, Harris did sit down with Brit Bears you just saw on Fox News."
And so the last election Biden won it very narrowly.
It's like if you were cutting something with scissors or a knife and the blade is wiggling.
"There's no common sense We need a change of leadership simple simple Voters know man and right now Trump is skyrocketing in Millions and millions of people say Trump won the debate on the side of voters say Trump won the debate We believe Trump wanted to debate and I wish that uh, they would he he want to took so much of their bait as It was a three verse one But he still came out on top man Which is the economy before the debate Donald Trump 53 after the debate 55 Kamala Harris before 37 after after 35 so virtually no movement on that and if anything, I know it's margin of error But it went down a little bit Again cuz she couldn't answer she couldn't answer she dodged She dodged the questions What did you expect after dodging the equal the questions, what did you expect?"
So we're not trying to compute derivatives or anything.
"And Donald Trump does have this branding that has worked well for him of this businessman, this successful businessman persona that can run this country like a business."
"By the way, also we have the America first design the Rep logo design all of our original designs plus the new designs."
"Vice President Harris hailed her new running mate as a veteran, six term congressman and two term governor who is prepared to take on their rivals."
Has the Harris campaign reached out to you or have you reached out to them?
And also by saying they kept repeating this whole bullseye thing that Joe Biden said.
And I hope you still feel that way.
"Don't just sort of accept the fact that the president of the group, you know, endorsed you."
Take those words seriously.
Federman now says he doesn't want to debate Dr. Oz.
"People said, I can't accept that."
Secret Service.
We're tired of the deceit.
Some are just built different.
Maybe he did.
Everyone let's thank President Trump.
He is.
"But when you go to a Trump rally, it's 90 percent and above."
"Not engaged, not participating."
And if it wasn't for the mail-in votes Oz would have won because a lot of these votes were before the debate which everyone agrees was a complete disaster for Federman.
"Now, Trump's focus on tax cuts remains central to his 2024 campaign."
So maybe you could say that's also a good sign.
Donald Trump left office.
I saw a picture of her on Time Magazine today.
"And then I think the report was, what was the report?"
Kamala Harris.
One of the most consequential implications of this intricate electoral landscape is the critical role of voter turnout.
"Democrats went down by roughly 300,000 votes."
She couldn't move on Friday.
"But based off of their own histories, their own track records, I don't think they're going to be correct."
"And the Republican governor of Ohio, a Trump ally, is pushing back on baseless conspiracy theories amplified by Trump in the debate about immigrants."
I'm losing track of time here as this election gets closer and closer.
"And this time, we're really digging into the 2024 election."
"What's your message to voters who, even though they're seeing this, are still undecided?"
"Yeah, she will lose ground."
"Beyond that, she said what she wanted to say in a way that was consistent with what she said in the past or not said in the past."
The headline on one of his recent sub stack blog posts.
"The polling got closer, but the raw data from voter registration suggests, uh, no, there is not a Democrat surge."
"Yes, some of them are mad about my hair."
"In terms of the interview itself, I think the highlight for her was being feisty and separating herself a little bit from Joe Biden, saying, I think, under-covered so far that her administration would not be a continuation of his."
"So, critical state, critical district here, critical county, because Luzerne County is really a toss-up here."
"The article said things were going as planned, Trump's taking questions, and then two people in the crowd have medical emergencies."
They also have a lot more money left over than Trump and his side.
There was the smile and the laugh.
"But either way, there's four other polls that dropped that found Trump either slightly ahead or in a statistical tie with Harris."
"Before we get into the video, please consider subscribing to the channel and comment down below on what other videos United States need you next."
"Because every time a Democrat outperforms in a special election, it's definitive."
"And it's pretty damn un-American, if you ask me."
"And of course you don't hear them mention inflation at all, but this just goes to show you how much these people manipulate things."
And Caitlin I understand that we've also been seeing in the crowd that that that event has been turned into something of a rallying cry even with some participants wearing.
The challenge though is that you know Pennsylvania on the issues lines up significantly more favorably for Donald Trump than it does for Kamala Harris.
"According to artificial intelligence, the fourth and fifth trumpets are two of the seven trumpets that bring judgment in the book of Revelation."
So expect those tensions to still be there if Trump is elected but it's certainly a conference much more aligned with his economic message than what we had in a first Trump term.
Leading Trump by a comfortable margin of 58% to 33%.
"Trump's message of economic nationalism, including his promises to bring back manufacturing jobs and renegotiate trade deals, resonated strongly with voters in the state in both 2016 and 2020."
And I'm really optimistic.
81% to about 18.
"If you have any doubt how important the youth vote is to both campaigns, just rewind the Republican and Democratic National Conventions this past summer."
"McClelland was quick to add, though, that she would support the Democratic ticket regardless of who is nominated for vice president, but praised Cooper as the best choice."
"On Saturday, Trump will hold a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, returning to the site of that first assassination attempt back in July."
"Clinton, who debated Trump three times during the 2016 election, offered her advice."
You look at Morning Compost like they're in the mix and they are a horrendous pollster with an awful track record.
"In 2020, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris overwhelmingly swept into office off the immense support of ladies in the suburbs."
"So whether you look at our poll, which shows Trump with a slight edge in Arizona, all the polls have it either, you know, I didn't worry, upward to Harris plus five or Trump plus five."
And it's an active investigation that's going on now that we're going to put out our own report as to what happened that day.
Do they turn out for Biden?
But she's even worse for the Jews.
"And when you break that vote down by ethnicity, you're talking about Polish Americans, Irish Americans, you name it."
Here we go.
"In Tampa, they had 100 mile gusts of wind."
What was it outside of Nevada in 2016?
And so the US is going to be involved.
"All right, let's go across to California."
"I mean, if your coworkers acted like that, they wouldn't be your coworkers very long."
They've already made up their minds for Harris.
A lack of strong turnout in Philadelphia or diminished support in suburban areas could easily tip the scales in favor of her vote.
She did it on everything from the border on immigration.
Both she and Donald Trump are so so focused on that state.
Trafalgar is to the left of Quinnipiac of all polls.

But could last night's vote be trouble for Trump?
" Now with less than two months to go for the US presidential elections, former President Donald Trump also campaigned in Pennsylvania, in fact in Butler in Pennsylvania, the same site where there was an assassination attempt targeting him in that campaign rally."
"Meanwhile, Rasmussen also called the race and PA within their margin of error and only missed it by two points overestimating the Democrats."
"Like half of that is completely untrue, at least before he ran for Senate."
"So don't say I'm not voting for Republican, but I'm not that behind VP Harris."
"The polling data from Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada highlights a competitive landscape as we approach the elections."
"By the way, even the Amish individuals who were in attendance got bored."
"Now, Donald Trump was not out on the campaign trail today."
That is not good for Harris one bit.
And I've seen a division in our country that I don't think he's going to be able to unify.
Harris finished 1 point ahead of Trump in this poll.
Can you imagine if I did that?
"Um, Donald Trump."
Why are we doing this?
"Also, to be fair, he was stood up."
"By the way, Biden plus seven."
"Listen, everybody, let's get right to it."
"They they they just Disappeared into the abyss gone, you know, and he says I'll post this here because all the comments are hidden On your most recent video and I want to make that clear to people out there as well There's been times in the past like shout out brendan."
"I know some people are talking about Minnesota, New York, Virginia, Maine at large."
Clinton was up by six.
It's been disheartening because it feels like the healthy staples that moms want to be their families are what is just out of hand.
Virginia Tech?
"You're gonna claim that Biden won Pennsylvania by five points, yet you can only get Harris up by four?"
And we even constituted our own private investigation because I don't trust the federal government.
"So right before she comes here to the arena, she is actually sitting down having a conversation with black men about the economy and about the opportunities that she claims she can create for them."
And do you really think that Harris is going to do better than Joe Biden by nearly two points in the state of Pennsylvania?
"Code enforcement comes around, they can write a citation but we haven't seen them yet."
Play the clip.
"We want to lower immigration, illegal and legal."
"So you better think this gas, it ain't gonna be here forever."
"He just wants to, he wants to do it."
And we're going to get to the bottom of all the security failures.
"And I will take Republican President Trump pro energy agenda, three offshore lease sales scheduled in the next five years, the fewest in history history."
"I remember after the home mortgage crisis, Kamala pushed me and my administration harder than any other Attorney General in the country to make sure homeowners got a fair settlement."
"Now, even more proud she left the GOP."
I've been around since Barry Goldwater.
And just showing up so early on a Saturday?
And I think that's because there's still a whole cadre of left leaning pollsters that progressively moved Harris up week after week.
"I believe that your word is your bond, like your word should matter."
"In the second poll, conducted by Signal from August 14 to 15, with 800 likely voters, Harris received 48% of the vote, while Trump received 47%."
The stage is now set for the first face-off and meeting between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
"In North Carolina yesterday, Kamala Harris said this."
So what that means of course he will not eliminate them but only he's telling that he will stop this all nonsense stuff what they're teaching in schools like operation changing the genders or women's sorry men's competing in the women's sports all these kind of stuffs he will stop this bullshit.
"And why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch."
"Although if you look at the 2020 polls in Pennsylvania, it is true that he led by over 7 percentage points in October."
And we know our country is going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it and to fight for what we stand for.
That's a Harris point three.
Maybe that's why they're off by so much that doesn't explain a Biden plus seven just two weeks before Election Day.
"But again, that's not too much to worry for the Republican Party."
"There was among Democrats who were unhappy about Biden, but there wasn't anything moving or changing."
Westchester.
And Donald Trump has been part of that.
"You got like, what, 10% of his voter base."
Let's dive into the recent polls of August in Pennsylvania.
Part of the message has to do with immigration.
"Though most black men agreed to President Obama's sentiments, some made some rather strong objections."
"My family and I, we drove home as soon as we saw this."
We only have a month left to Election Day.
"And these are just safe states and also, maybe because of Philadelphia, because there's so many votes."
And then you have these other candidates.
Harris's growth in Pennsylvania underscores how critical this state has become.
Ooh.
So they're going to be here duking it out to get these votes.
"That was in 2022, winning by an eye-catching 14 points."
Is that a state North Carolina we're talking about that Kamala Harris can really win?
There's too much money and momentum behind fracking as an industry like it'll it's gonna happen no matter who like really from the no matter a Democrat or Republican at this point like it's gonna happen.
Trump has allocated the majority of his advertising budget to Pennsylvania and has held more rallies in this battleground state than any other since Harris officially entered the race for the White House.
Reproductive rights or LGBTQ rights are kind of equally important.
"It's really, I think, insulting people in an election like this when so much is on the line."
I just don't think you're going to see Harris Harris point miss.

You know how annoying he's going to be now?
"Maybe they just said oh, well I supported her in the primary."
You will see this consistent trend of Donald Trump.
I don't think it's fair.
Maybe it's just one poll.
A poll conducted between September 28 and October 8 offers a snapshot of the electoral climate among registered voters.
The increased security presence we got on the ground here yesterday and well over 24 hours before this rally was set to begin the area and the site was completely locked down so heightened security here actually the U.S. Secret Service had extended the security perimeter and they're going to have personnel stationed on that shed where the shooter fired shots but the dynamics of this rally are are similar we've talked to a lot of supporters here who are eager to see the former president return they think that this sends an important message him coming back here and we also spoke to someone who was here that day in July on July 13th at that rally and felt that he needed to return here just as the president is.
They don't seem to want to do another debate.
This is their reality.
I want to thank everybody.
The country supported Roe versus Wade.
"But several factors could sway the final outcome in Pennsylvania like economic issues, voter turnout, suburban voters, and energy policies."
These people are held for this long.
Is that something that's on your mind?
"I don't want this person who's going to completely ruin the country to be there because they say things that make me feel good, but I digress."
You have to.
"Anyways, folks, thank you so much for watching."
Who do you think won by show of hands former president Trump?
This is an incredible volunteer effort by everybody in this area.
What the hell how could they talking about?

"My mom, of course, is she shattered."
"So during the rally, his nephew was with his friends and family, which is to the president's right, down a little bit lower."

"The way that the country was handled last four years, people lost their jobs."
New polling from Emerson College shows Harris neck and neck with Trump in those swing states.

"Wick, Whitmer plus one."
"It's an example of how at the end of the day, this election, it's not just about policies."

"This shift in Trump's favor reflects his ability to rally voters and gain momentum, indicating that Pennsylvania remains a battleground state where Trump is making strong inroads."
And I know I think you talked about the me of Ham Trammock endorsed the president of Trump.
But there's a big catch to that.
Pennsylvania and Florida.
"Their support, driven by a range of interests from health care and education to economic equity and environmental protection, reflects the diverse coalition Harris has built as she seeks the presidency."
It really is.
"Which means he can win the election if he just gets the state of Pennsylvania, which is 19 electoral votes, which is the most electoral votes out of any swing state in the entire country."
Here's what Donald Trump's talking about in Reading.
It's all about how the media spins it.
Donald Trump is holding a rally.
Trump won by eight.
And she's the only one who called Trump winning in Pennsylvania.
"The Trump campaign, let's start there, claims that it was hacked."
Publish the work.
It's nerve-wracking.
You're totally fucked.
The New York Times.
"And of course, you can vote at your polling place on Election Day, November 5th."
Josh Appearo can make that sale.
She was saying also that she was committed to passing the Green New Deal.
"If MSNBC reported more like CNN, and this is not an endorsement of the fairness of CNN, although I will tell you I do not over and over again see CNN hosts banging away at Trump's dictator with spittle flying from their mouths the same way I do on MSNBC."
They target young black men.
"Kamala Harris has been part of a team that has made it the largest increase in oil production, natural gas production in American history."
I just don't know.

He's got the core states that he held in 2020 plus North Carolina so far in his column.
"As president elect, if I win this election, the first thing I'm gonna do is call up Zelensky and call up President Putin."
"All I heard from Donald Trump was more angry vilification of immigrants, more goofy conspiracy theories about nine-month abortions and eating your neighbor's cat and those aren't policy proposals and I really was looking for something like that."
You're going to vote.
It's a recurring theme and pattern.
It means they have a better than 50% chance of winning.
"Three big outliers of Harris plus two, Harris plus three, and of course, Bloomberg with Harris plus five."

"50% to 47%, it's quite extraordinary to think that it wasn't too long ago that Florida was synonymous with the term swing state."

"But Ruben and I were talking to a remarkable group of men right before we came out and we were talking about this and somebody said, Man, I'm just so tired of everybody being divided and mean and nasty."

Hold that in your head.
But it is a response to concerns that have been raised largely over an issue in Alabama that has subsequently been resolved there too.
So it's about a half a percentage point win for Trump in 2016 and a one percentage point win for Biden in 2020.
"And then what, five minutes ago all of a sudden?"
You made it.
It's ironic because Obama definitely hates Biden.
"Oh, sure."
That is a clarion call that Trump is making to people.
"Anthony, good to see you."
"And just remember that after this election, there will still be plenty of Republicans in the House and the Senate."

How did you get into farm to farm to see how m get involved in that?
I felt like it was her most genuine and passionate That I saw her pretty much throughout it I Didn't necessarily agree with what she was saying but my favorable reactions were because it was nice to see the passion and Believability that she stands behind and then have something to gauge More of what she says on since she hasn't spoken a lot solidly about a lot of issues And I think what's been interesting again following how you guys were tracking the debate which is a fascinating experience and I should know We nobody in this room has been listening to the postgame coverage.
"Oh, I don't know."
Everybody tune in because it's time to address something.

"Recent polls show Harris leading Trump in key states like Arizona and North Carolina, although she trails slightly in Nevada and Georgia."
"And given Trump has been president in the past, we know voters can compare his administration to the Biden administration."
"But in the polling at this point in the polling, he was up by like a ridiculous five points in the industry."
So I want to talk a little bit about that.
The problem is I just think they're for a lot of Trump voters.
Bloomberg is coming.
"But in our 50, Trump got 48."
"In fact, she played a video of one of his latest comments where he talked about having the military go after the enemy within."
 And Kamala Harris are hitting the campaign trail in the battleground state of Pennsylvania today.
"And so whether you harken back to the Donald Trump future, because he would say that's what he's delivering in the future or to a different vision of the future from Kamala Harris, I think both these candidates will need to tie that into their message this evening."

"The debate, I think we saw with her own eyes, I think she did pretty well against him."
And this is as she tries to court Republican voters from moderate Republicans to Republicans who have turned against former President Donald Trump.
"And that's critical because, let's face it, whoever wins Pennsylvania more than likely is gonna win the presidency."
Good moment to head out then?
It's not even believable.
"Pennsylvania is always a swing state, but it feels like the whole election could hinge on it this time around."
"Meanwhile, Andrzej Duda is meeting with Polish Americans, emphasizing their role in building American policy, extremely important for Poland today."

I get that.
"Advocates say that it could prevent the US citizenship pronunciation, which occurs partly due to this complex tax regulation."
So great.
"So it's a clear choice on rights, but it's also a clear choice on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, the tax code."
Dive into that world a little bit.
"The official said nearly 2,000 North Carolinians signed up to volunteer during Tuesday night's debate."
"Well, she has a whole post dedicated to that one, which is, whoa, no one should go to jail for smoking weed, which is hilarious, because Kamala Harris prosecuted and put people in jail for smoking weed, which is just wild."

"Issues like racial equality, health care and education are often key concerns for this group."
You see what I'm saying?
" Matters concerning the economy on the one hand and industry on the other, including the steel industry, as well as the mining industry, were key messages that flowed from the rally Donald Trump just held."
A man had character.

Nobody has time to read all of this.
"And so final note here, these battleground state polls continue to build on this very, very long standing story since the moment that she was announced as the contender for president of the United States is that this momentum is growing."

"I think it's going to happen because we're just getting out too close for either side to back out, and everybody assumes it's going to happen."

"Hit subscribe, everybody."
But you take that energy out.
"But yes, competition is expected to get intense."
"This result highlights Trump's continued momentum and ability to appeal to a broad cross-section of voters, keeping him highly competitive in Pennsylvania."
I'm here to widen the middle class.
" Joining us now is Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who was, who is the governor there in that state where you just had that spirited debate."
I didn't need the money.
They will be in a few weeks That's important to note But Trump is making the claim that look the voters already know the issues They already know the candidates Why bother but yesterday vice president Kamala Harris in Greensboro said we actually owe it to the voters to do a second debate for them to see Kind of how Trump and I are interacting on the stage what policy differences we have and how they would impact those voters So remains to be seen whether we will see these two candidates on the debate stage again as as of this moment Donald Trump is ruling it out But CBS News proposed a debate yesterday with our partners at Univision and Wall Street Journal So we welcome them anytime to come on and talk about it.
Change his tire.
Their plan is working in my opinion.
I know.
And it was talked about using the military even before taking office again if he were to.
That's a Trump.

"Kamala Harris has shown to not only bolster excitement amongst the Democratic coalition, she's also shown to expand that base and its reach, particularly with Gen Z, a lot of younger diverse voters were seeing the attacks on women's reproductive rights that have fallen flat for the right and they consistently continue to do so."
"It's a must have for Kamala Harris, but if you look at other states that are swing states like Arizona, like Georgia, like Nevada, you know Trump is actually doing better and overperforming in all those states than he did in 2020 and in 2016."
Ain't nothing but Dick Cheney in a pantsuit.
Why are y for this event?
But Pennsylvania could be a critical state and the willingness of a massive number of people to show up has to count for something.
"Now let me say this, I'm not saying that she can't win this election."

"He said just just the other day, we actually lost it by a whisker."
"And even, you know, you expect to see it in the rural and suburban areas."

"I think the big question everyone is asking as we get very close to the election, three weeks now, as you said at the beginning of this segment, is who does this actually advantage?"
"They always asked me about Eric, about Don Jr. and Ivanka, all of the children."
Was that an honest thing to say?
And we have other polling out of other swing states.
This might not seem like much.
That's why we hold office.
What do you think about that?
That's an incredible thing.
61% of economists saw interest rates being higher under a hypothetical President Trump than under Harris.
Rubin worked on that.
"The event, held on August 1, 2024, was Trump's first appearance in the state since a harrowing incident at a previous rally, which had left many supporters concerned for his safety."

Because I think there's a momentum.
"Before her rally tonight, Vice President Harris visited a local black-owned small business for a conversation with black men from the Erie, Pennsylvania area after visiting with black farmers ahead of her remarks in North Carolina yesterday."
You could just breathe on him.
It was kind of long.
The event co-host was Republican Governor Kristi Noem.
Each campaign is rolling out different ideas on the daily.
So the campaign is certainly trying to find ways for her to continue to message on this.
This we're looking realistic here.
"There are several things working against Kamala Harris We'll get right to the point The first thing that we wanna discuss is her ethnicity A man wheeled out in Aruba T'Lutha Bryan, who said she's going to win I like the positivity But her ethnicity is a problem, demographically And I'll explain myself, please Don't jump down my grill, just bear with me I say this with no malice But she is a immigrant child Not an ADOS person, not an FDA person Point one, point two She comes from a biracial Jamaican father She comes from a Brahmin Indian family Both of those aspects The woman has about 1 eighth African in her That we know of About 1 eighth So the pretense that this is a black woman in the regards of a traditional African black woman Here in America is not true And they're gonna try to sell her as a black president The same way Obama was sold as a black president, except Obama was half African Again, not a descendant of slaves like some of us But he married into the family Kamala chose to marry Doug, who is a white Jewish man So she already has this exotic background And then she adds to it a white Jewish man Now, I grew up in Pennsylvania And obviously Pennsylvania has a Jewish president, Josh Shapiro So Pennsylvania is not really all that biased against Shapiro or Jewish people in particular But in central Pennsylvania, between Philly and Pittsburgh, where I grew up It might as well be Alabama, Salute to Harrisburg, Harrisburg City as well But it might as well be Alabama, where I grew up And I grew up in what was solid blue democratic territory Looks like the music's a little bit louder, but I'm gonna bring the music down just a little bit Pardon me for a second while I do that But I grew up in that solid blue democratic territory led by Congressman Jack Mirtha Who I watched put on black men from my hometown In the late 70s, as I was a kid, and things were changing in America We started seeing brothers get executive positions in my hometown Salute to Kelly Washington, his family, Vanessa, P, all them But his family was benefited My family was benefited I can honestly say that my father got his job largely because of affirmative action Now, I know how that sounds in 2024 But when you grow up in a town like I did, you had to force white people to have at least one employee on site You had to force them They literally would not hire black people Crump from, so we're talking about Pennsylvania We ain't talking about Alabama, but I'm telling you between Pittsburgh and Philly, it might as well be So that's the environment I grew up in With this movement out of the the civil rights movement And people like my father coming back from Vietnam, they got theirs, right?"
And you have and you yourself have been spending some time in western Pennsylvania correct?
It's been devastating.
Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote and Donald Trump 47%.
"He's caught, by the way, I hate to say it, he reminds me of myself in these situations because that's the way I would handle it."
"Couple of things that stand out behind that, right?"

"Joe, why do you think he kept his distance from discussing the GOP stance against abortion?"
But why is Zelensky going to an American factory in a swing state like Pennsylvania and having Shapiro sign artillery shells bragging about bombing Russia?

"That's what we do over here on this channel So uh, subscribe hit the comments and i'll catch you guys on the next one."
And Trump won today's final poll by one point.
Way more.
"Oh, prices right."
Disappointed.
Nobody is fighting harder for America than Donald Trump.
"It is possible the polls are going to overestimate Kamala Harris in Wisconsin, which they have for quite some time."

"He has worked to prevent women from making their own health care decisions and threaten your fundamental freedoms and rights like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride."
Trying to make that case to black men around the country that especially younger black men that she should be the one with their vote.
"Again, Harris won the poll by two points."
"That's helping us, frankly, be energy secure and help us meet our climate goals going forward."

Kamala Harris is ready to do the job.
"Please read, don't delete."
"Again, this is not a Republican."
And he would talk to Anna's point about economic populism.
And let me sing it.
"Come on, people."
You're get shit done agenda.

And Kamala Harris making these massive improvements relative to President Biden have only continued and the momentum has been built and it's gaining in a very good way for the Democratic Party.
Opportunity.
And they're targeting Republican voting districts.
And that's what this campaign is about.
It was a chaotic moment.
They're implying their opinion.
And she constantly harangs former President Trump and voters still don't know who she is or what she is.
A woke military.
"Like this topic here about working class voters in the city of Philadelphia moving to the right, where you have 10 articles."
It could even flip.
"And so, you know, look share this network share this video."

To their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next that is immoral and One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree The government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body That sound obviously that moment was a critical moment Not just for the debate on one of the critical issues of this campaign on the issue of reproductive rights and abortion But there's also one that garnered significant reaction from our focus group Don't ask about right now for those of you who responded positively to Vice President Harris's answer.

The debate taking place in the hotly contested battleground state of Pennsylvania where voters will be closely watching.
Couple that with Georgia.
That is something that people have rejected time and time again in elections.
"And he has quite a, you know, he's a veteran on Capitol Hill."
Or they would have charged him that way.
And Harris rose to the top of the ticket.
The administration is a new generation.
You saw Senator Bernie Sanders saying that he was for Tim Walz of Minnesota.
"If you had a family member who acted like that, just making stuff up, hurtful stuff, you might still love them, but you'd tell them you've got a problem, and you certainly wouldn't put them in charge of anything."

"There's no clashes, but everything's going well right now and we have plenty of staff to handle whatever situation we have."
I think that's going to be key for him.

I think she can.
"Jabari Michael Kensu, a Kappa Alpha Psi alum chapter member and a pit graduate, echoed her sentiment."

I'm out.
So you really want Donald Trump to win?
"Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro told us that choosing Al Schmidt, a lifelong Republican, as his first Cabinet pick last year, was intended to send a clear message."

"Small business help, child tax credits."
Harris is being pulled in several different directions when choosing her VP pick.
It's no big deal.
"I said, have lunch at beautiful Mar-a-Lago."
And Donald Trump also hit the trail in the state with a town hall outside Philadelphia.
There's a moment that a lot of people are talking about this morning where the former president just stood on stage for 30 minutes awkwardly while a greatest hits of his favorite songs played.
The Biden administration's support for Israel has clearly struck a nerve.
And we plan to vote for again this year.
"And so the New York Times, when I'm sure the Trump campaign wrote off as fake news, but then came Quinnipiac University, a nonpartisan poll that doesn't dabble into Democrat or Republican politics."
"I would rather be in Trump's position right now than Harris's, because if you're Trump, well, a point miss is kind of expected, especially with two big outliers like Quinnipiac, like Bloomberg, inflating Harris's margin."

"And so a lot of strengths, among other options."
But maybe something crazy happens.
So what is the fourth trumpet Intel?
"She's accusing Vice President Kamala Harris of flip-flopping on fracking, which she now says she will not ban."
"And a lot of them did vote for him twice, but also you talk about him just gaining potential support in a lot of these places."
So Donald Trump is really surging in the key state of Pennsylvania.
Biden is not going to win the white vote in Wisconsin.

"They stand by Trump's false claim that Joe Biden lost the 2020 election, even if it takes a minute."
"He would help us maybe a point, but it's not enough."
" Good evening everyone, I'm Lindsay Davis."
A little off because usually.
I'm going to tell you something.
"First up, the University of Massachusetts Lowell poll conducted between September 11th and 19th."
"And one of the crazy things is, you know, they were out there calling him and I apologize for these terms."
"OK, yeah, compared to 2020, even 2022."
Here are some of the sounds from the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaign rallies on Friday.
73 percent of likely voters supporting Trump say they are very enthusiastic about supporting him compared to 70 percent in August.
That's real.
Just get out to the polls on us.
"And you know, everything's on the line this November."
"Send it to the big house, not the White House."
Some of these counties feeling left behind?
"I don't think it's just for black men, so I think that's for everybody."
"And good for Harris again, because like I sometimes I get a little, you know, I think we highlight walls because he's a wonderful communicator and like does a lot of the things that we wanted for the Democrats to do."
This is why Trump needs to come in.
Voter turnout will be crucial in Pennsylvania.
You're gonna have leaders who try to help and then there you have a guy who will just lie about it to score political points and this has consequences.
"But nice seeing you, everybody."
Lots of fun stuff.
There was rumors of an Atlas Intel drop over the weekend.
It's a path that can be fraught.
"So you can see the change certainly in the polling in Pennsylvania before dropping out, before President Biden dropped out."
We can't let we can't continue to let petty partisan politics get in the way of our responsibility.
"Harris holds a tight lead in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin."
It's just a stage.
"He uses Latinos poor Trump, right?"
"Okay, you got that."
"Well, you had a peaceful transfer of power."
H I just saw them occasionally our local markets and I g to them for emergency room and they also provide tran different connections.
"You know, we're in May."
"There's a very slim number of truly undecided voters and they're they're very kind of diverse group, like understanding exactly what they're what's holding them back is challenging."
"Donald Trump left office with net loss of 3 million jobs, with a 6.3% unemployment rate, with an economic contraction of 3.4%."
But so I would personally keep that in mind.
Biden's endorsement of Harris only pushing her further away.
"But this time around, I believe it's a must win state for Trump."
"Meanwhile, Trump is targeting rural and suburban areas, where his messages on law and order resonate strongly."
But Philadelphia is actually given the Democrats less and less votes.
And there's huge stuff going on right now about potentially World War Three with Biden and the administration giving the okay for Ukraine to use long range missiles.
"But you've heard what he said through those people about the military, about wounded veterans, about Normandy."
"I mean, this Marist poll, it's 49-49 Trump and Harris."
What more can you tell us about the efforts?
It's called an economic opportunity agenda for black men.
You heard his words coming from him.
"Danielle, if you look at that footage, I'm sure he's been hit."
It's with a guy who's actually lucid enough to not hit the nuclear button.
Come on.
Do you think that Pennsylvania was a battleground state when Biden was in the race?
Trump said he says Nancy Pelosi caused the insurrection.
Federman ran several points behind the winning Democratic gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro.
I don't know how he was going out but the census predicted and you know they always write about shit but if they catch old dude um where we send bail money where do we send book money because I will definitely be chipping in.
And I think that was one of them.
Casey was way ahead.
"President Biden talking about tangible benefits, whether it's healthcare, whether it's social security, whether it is jobs, jobs, and better paying jobs, whether it's helping unions, being there with workers, whether it's infrastructure, whether it's the chips act bringing important jobs here in the semiconductor industry, investing in America, whether it is protecting veterans, protecting seniors."
But the truth is that people are feeling the pinch.
We want safety and security for our country.
I'd rather try the case than be the defendant.
"I don't know if you guys saw this with the low budget discount, Chris Cuomo interviewing Kamala Harris."
They're farmers.
It took me so long.
It's usually not going to be like that.
And she also recently made racist comments about Kamala Harris on social media site X.
"It seemed like just a lot of talk, not a lot of real answers."
 Let's pivot now to Libby Cathy.
"And, you know, head on over to bobkasey.com and chip in two, three, four bucks, whatever you can afford."
Because it's one thing to earn the support of the leader of an organization.
"And Jay, Harris is getting some good polling this morning in the Sunbelt states."
The gap has narrowed.
Are your tax returns still unfiled?
They are not in this country illegally.
It's out of our favorite pollster.
We'll get right into it like we always do when we talk about the latest in national polling.
"Somebody said, look, we used to be able to have a decent living on 40,000 a year."
I saw on the news were them celebrating with our guns in their hands I realized what a travesty that was a in the loss of money in that let we Abandoned when we left plus the very bullets that we left there that they were shooting as us at us as we flew away into planes
"He will be doing a big rally tonight in Detroit, and he'll also be visiting a campaign office in an Arab American community in which the mayor actually endorsed him."
Please welcome the 45th president and the 47th president.
"As we are speaking now, there is an aggressive military campaign going on in Lebanon, where your parents are from."
"That's a pretty big break, at least symbolically."
I don't think it's enough for Harris to win Pennsylvania.
"OK, so we've covered the polls, the demographics, the economy and voter turnout."
"In open economy, he supported TPP."
I support Buybacks and it's something I'm so passionate about and so looking forward to being president to address how mandatory is your gun buyback program It's mandatory.
So we're just over the moon.
"And let me ask you one last question, Libby."
Why won't Trump go with Brett Baier and others?
They don't feel they need them.
Donald Trump is your president.
And Harris currently holds a razor thin lead here.
Biden announced the violence and Biden announced that the violence remarks Saturday night and said that in a statement earlier that he's grateful Trump is safe.
"Inside her advantage, you know, John Wick Trafalgar Mitchell Research."
We win this great Commonwealth.
"In Ohio, he grew up, I believe, on the outskirts of Youngstown, trying to present himself as someone who is a more moderate centrist figure in tune with working people than perhaps is the image of other members of the Democratic Party."
And so we're not going to see that as a secret service that would have to answer questions as to why that rooftop just outside the perimeter wasn't secure.
I'm Manny the movie guy for ANC.
It could really improve his chances and it's all about getting the vote out.
"So if he's able to close that gap, which isn't a given, this could end up being just as close of a race in the Senate as it is for president."
And we will close the border.
This is from Gallup.
And this was an opportunity.
"And since then, and since Joe Biden had departed the race and now entered back, Kamala Harris now entering in, she is at the highest point we have seen for Democrats in a very long time."
It was in the heavens.
"Okay, that's true, but it's a bit misleading for a couple of reasons."
But that's so short sighted and they're not looking at the long term and what will come because with Kamala Harris presidency will come these EV mandates and it will be a long term demise of the auto industry.
Dramatic is the right way to sum up this election so far.
"She said the same speech, that she had nothing, that had nothing to do with the question."
But that's Quinnipiac of The New York Times.
We're not derogatory.
Far more numbers out there to support Kamala Harris.
But do you really think a drop off of this magnitude is just explained as well.
They loved Kamala up until like two weeks ago.
The Trump led by five.
Then they want to support family farmers and quote help ensure future generations of American farmers can thrive by helping beginning farmers get more access to credit and connecting them with all sorts of training and technical assistance.
"Degan, can you explain the difference?"
It was very much the same place where it was between Trump and Biden.
I want to ask Republicans out there.
"Anthony, that's fascinating data there."
Decisions is being letting you.
"No, Siri, it is not."
"Again, if heels up doesn't win Pennsylvania, it's over."
"They most of them, the majority of them, Hannah, have said there are things they like about Shapiro."
Let's look at this.
Stay engaged.
How you doing?
"But right now she is still very much in a position she was in yesterday and the day before, which is being on track for victory and on track for an Electoral College win that could be even bigger than Joe Biden's that's yet to be seen, but not at all out of the realm of possibility 10 weeks ago that was never even in the books."
"It's a good site, good aggregator for news, good aggregator for polls."
"Large population of black voters who Dems need to mobilize has fast-growing, highly educated, mostly white suburbs outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where Republicans have been bleeding support in the Trump years."
"Former U.S. President Barack Obama has found himself on the wrong side of American voters, particularly black men."
"The early voting trends suggest that many Pennsylvanians are already casting their votes based on these issues, and the Democrats' dominance in early voting is a direct reflection of this shift in the electorate."
Now I want to get into some fun.
Do they think it's fair that some are calling them fickle?
"It also enhances his legal and political strategy, shapes the narrative on election fraud, consolidates Republican support, and sets the stage for effective debate performance."
" Guys, welcome back to today's video."
And that's with polls typically underestimating Donald Trump significantly in the state of Pennsylvania.
"Lots of attacks, not much yet on the issues."
It's almost the opposite.
I'm so sorry to be right in your face.
So how are both sides trying to move the needle in the coming weeks?
This is just the popular vote.
Is that just what you add it all up to and what we see now?
"Just recently, Donald Trump has come out and said that he's actually going to be a champion for IVF and he's actually expressed hostility toward the six-week abortion ban that his own policies facilitated."
And so you stepped into my frame.
There's a lot of polls as well that have them tied and we have one outlier from morning compost that so delusionally believes that Harris is a got a similar lead in the state to what Obama had back in 2012.
"So, you know, this is not the kind of thing where it's like Bernie Sanders talking about the billionaire class, the stuff that we really love as well."
"His substantial donation is aimed at supporting Harris' vision of creating more equitable and thriving urban communities across the country, ensuring that economic growth benefits all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic status."
"The idea that Trump is going to get 50% in any of the swing states that are not faux swing states like Texas or Florida, I guess are those faux swing states are not really swing states that we have the seven, right?"
"This from the New Republic, Trump's hateful new rants at rally are harshly debunked by town leader."
"I still think it will be under five points no matter who wins the election, even if Kamala Harris has a quote unquote massive victory nationwide because Pennsylvania is born to be about a ground state."
And we're going to get it done.
"Yeah, I'm only 18, so this will be... Well, I registered last October, but... First election?"
I don't think he will.
And we were able to do that when we terminated Roe v Wade.
Then I want to get your reaction.
"Trump's campaign has banked on this very strategy, hoping that a late surge at the polls could offset Harris' early voting advantage."
And we talk about 2020.
And will it be by enough to give Trump the victory in Pennsylvania?
It's completely different.
"Just send somebody in and say, Hey, JD Vance, he's running for vice president."
"But the fact is, Mr. Mayor, Jill Stein is not going to be president of the United States."
Does she need to do a bit of a better job selling her vision for the economy?
"Sabrina, the so-called Vibe said, the idea that even though you might be personally in our data shows this nationally, people feel I'm OK, but I'm pessimistic about the future."
This should be some kind of a crime.
It's the greatest movement in the history of our country.
"You know, you could have these intentions and then when you get into the presidency, you don't have the ideological foundations or rudder that can make you address questions that come to your desk and personnel decisions."
"And when they come down to that choice, whether it's on basic rights like women's rights, women's rights and workers rights, there's there's no common ground between me and David McCormick."
The number one issue for me is we gotta protect our homeland.
"And while in Pittsburgh, President Biden, he made a speech at the United Steelworkers headquarters, this on the heels of the announced acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan-based Nippon Steel."
"When you see what happened in Pennsylvania, do you see a microcosm for something that could be playing out nationwide among some Republicans skittish about Trump or is it more just a protest and they'll come home in November?"
We told you.
"Quinnipiac University had her up three points, a reduction of one point, but still largely in line with the average there in favor of Kamala Harris."
"The last time any of them voted for a Republican presidential candidate was New Hampshire back in the 2000 election, 6 cycles ago."
He's voted for a series of things that have made our Commonwealth much worse.
"So he seems to try to kind of split the issue here and say that he doesn't agree with the six week ban, but he's also going to vote no on the ballot measure that would overturn the six week ban."
"As I was saying, I want to just let you know that tonight I returned to Butler in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache to deliver a simple message to the people of Pennsylvania and to the people of America."
And how long would you say you've been a supporter of Donald Trump?
"In other words, Americans who don't support him."
"And Perry, it used to be that the opposing party would see the spotlight during the others' convention."
"So there's a possibility and some people have argued this, and I'm not denying this one bit, but there's a good possibility that at least a chunk of these new Republicans, they could just be ancestral Democrats that are finally Republicans, but that doesn't mean they actually changed parties."
"You know, he lost the county by 14 votes, literally."
Make peace with the fact that that man is about to be president.
"I, that was so unscripted."
"Let's move the, see these votes, you've got about a million votes in there."
"He was the worst host ever, and he read one of my truths at the Oscars."
But it does make you focus on the things that matter and the things that you care about and that you don't want to take for granted.
Protecting our democracy is a B.S.
60% right here.
"For the purposes of this video, I'm just going to be focusing on Pennsylvania today."
What we could see is Suffolk University is literally number one.
"And so we were like, I wonder if we could get her."
"And then the group of insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol, play the clip."
"For the sake of simplicity, this is decision desk ace Hughes map."
Now a lot of them get on board the ones who don't get on board some have retired some have left some have been primary voted out and what's left is a conference that is much more aligned with the Trump agenda than what we saw in a first term.
"The decline of traditional manufacturing jobs, for instance, has altered voter priorities and preferences, prompting many to seek candidates who are attuned to their economic realities."
"Here is one thing that she is going to do, legalize recreational marijuana for black Americans."
Section 7 â€“ Shaping the Race Trump's fiery rally in Harrisburg served as a reminder of the deep political divisions within the United States.
You're ready.
The point about Pennsylvania being America is very important.
"We all here, we love our country."
But to say that they're all going to show up with record turnout on Election Day is bullshit.
He lost the county 63 percent to 36 percent.
There are phone calls into police stations that are verifiable.
"For Trump voters, a majority say they feel that efforts to promote gender equality have been going too far."
Here you go.
"Trump, meanwhile, you can see him right here behind us, behind bulletproof glass."
Our family friend is 67 now.
So you do get the contrast.
They will hold their vote for something else.
"I mean, here's the reality of what Trump did today, Wolf, which is sort of pre-butt what we are going to get from Kamala Harris on Friday when she is in that very same now very clear battleground state, North Carolina."
And then Quinnipiac so far has been the biggest margin for either candidate at Harris plus five.
"We're going to choose not just the political direction of the country, the cultural direction of the country as well."
"And when it comes to crucial battleground states, well, the candidates are effectively even, with Harris up by just one percentage point."
She couldn't give a single answer to a single question because the truth is the sad truth is Kamala Harris doesn't have answers.
Pennsylvania is unique in that we have a divided legislature.
"I think he'd potentially be better in action because he's somebody who's more malleable, even if he is a grifter."
That's what I feel about it.
I don't know who I'm gonna vote for.
Now we have a new poll from the New York Times with Sienna College this is an A plus rated pollster apparently the best the best even though their polls are all over the place that this election season but they show Kamala Harris with a four point lead when you don't round out the results over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania when you round these are the numbers that they give us it is 50% for Kamala Harris 47% for Donald Trump a three point lead when rounded when you unround Trump falls down to 46% which gives her a very impressive four point lead in Pennsylvania and you will look at why this four point lead is so important not to mention Arizona of course while we have this poll up Donald Trump really expanding his lead in Arizona to now a 6% margin very impressive for him but we you know we really have had this common consensus now for quite a while now for months now that Donald Trump will carry the state of Arizona as well as other Sun Belt states but Pennsylvania is the important one here Arizona only has 11 electoral votes Pennsylvania has 19 in such a close race like this that eight more from Pennsylvania sorry yeah eight more on that really does matter a lot so that four point lead is important because we always talk about you know how much are the polls overestimated Joe Biden in the 2020 election right because when you look at 2020 he was expected to win by only four point seven percent and I say only because take that with with a state like Wisconsin in 2020 where Joe Biden was expected to win in the polls on election day by eight point four percent he only won it by point six so he was overestimated basically eight percent almost in the state of Wisconsin while you head over to Pennsylvania again he was expected to win by four point seven he won it by one point two so he was only over estimated here by some three and a half percent so to see Kamala Harris with the four point lead on rounded in Pennsylvania that's big because I do want to preface this with saying that I don't think that Kamala Harris will be overestimated in the polls at all I currently think that she will be underestimated in the polling so even if she is overestimated as much as Joe Biden was in the 2020 election in Pennsylvania she still wins again Biden was overestimated by three and a half percent in Pennsylvania when you do the math Harris has a four point lead currently she would still win the state by a very narrow margin so Pennsylvania is hugely important right you know so that was just to show you know how important this single poll is considering that it isn't a plus pollster but now we have to talk about Pennsylvania because the fact that the fact the matter is she is running away with Pennsylvania it's a very narrow lead um in in of court like the average I'm in the aggregate of polls um which is expected and again I don't I do think that Harris will outpace what polls are expecting I really do because poll stars are pollsters are worried about underestimating the Trump factor once again and everything like that so they are really boosting Trump's are they're giving an emphasis on Trump areas because they're you know the polling industry is you know going down right now in the dumps um so again they're really trying to get it accurate this time not underestimate Trump ultimately I think that Harris is being underestimated now just like 2022 the Democrats were but when it comes to the average you can see Harris has never let up once in the state of Pennsylvania that's insane that is absolutely insane Harris has kept a lead in Pennsylvania this entire race now let's compare that to a state like North Carolina for a moment we see we see um in the beginning of the race Trump had a pretty steady lead then Harris took the lead for a moment there for literally like two days then he was even then Trump took the back the lead then it was even again Trump took the lead Harris took the lead by point to Trump took the lead Harris took the lead Trump took the lead again Harris took the lead Trump took the lead and he still has the lead less than 1% this is the case and this is the most extreme case but this is a case that's going that's happening with many many many battleground states Michigan not Michigan sorry Wisconsin Nevada especially Arizona Georgia for sure but what you notice is that it's not happening in Pennsylvania and that's important the fact that there is a common consensus in the polling numbers is important fact that common layers is a clear leader is a clear favorite to win in Pennsylvania that's important let's just take a look at at the 538 forecast here let's I don't know what they are currently projected to be honest um they say that the presidential race is extremely narrow but I assume they say of course that Harris is favored to win in Pennsylvania you can see there she has a 52 to 48 percent chance of winning the state but looking at Pennsylvania specifically again it is so incredibly important that Kamala Harris does have a lock on Pennsylvania that's what I've been saying for a while when you look at the electoral map Pennsylvania proves to be extremely important this is my forecast that's the map these are all the numbers this is how I think that the election will go if it were held today or tomorrow or whatever so Pennsylvania is critical obviously to Kamala Harris on now if Trump does win Pennsylvania Kamala Harris actually still wins the election however she then has literally zero wiggle room the only place that she could lose is Nebraska second district resulting in her still winning the election even if she loses just Nevada on top of that you know just two slight changes in my forecast then she loses the election 267 to 271 however however North Carolina is basically toss-up I have a Harris plus 0.1 percent because I don't know it's too hard to tell there are too many factors Mark Robinson being on the ballot the state shifting left rapidly right now there are so many factors to consider North Carolina it's virtually toss-up I think that Harris wins by honestly a few thousand votes so look I would not be surprised in the slightest if Trump wins North Carolina because the odds really are 50-50 in my forecast right now considering that margin of Harris plus 0.1 so if North Carolina does go red which you say I'm on a chance that it goes red as it goes blue then she can't lose Pennsylvania then she has to hold Pennsylvania so the fact that she as I outlined she is you know she has this sort of lock on Pennsylvania right now as she has had throughout this race that's important because it is critical to her path to victory then if she holds Pennsylvania she could even lose Nevada Nevada could even go to Donald Trump and it could still result in a 270 win for Harrison walls 270 is the minimum you need to win the presidency that is just two electoral votes up against Trump and Vance so North Carolina and Nevada could easily go Republican but as long as she has Pennsylvania she wins the election and she holds the other blue wall states now what if Trump wins Pennsylvania it's you know obviously it's important to Harris's victory but if Trump is going to win the election of course I really think that you know he might need Pennsylvania however that he doesn't need it he could he could simply just run the Sun Belt North Carolina Georgia Arizona Nevada and then flip Wisconsin I think that Wisconsin will be closer than Pennsylvania so that of course can absolutely happen but if Pennsylvania does go red it really opens the door for Donald Trump if he wins the Sun Belt plus Pennsylvania he's at 287 17 more than he needs then he could even lose North Carolina and he still wins the election or he could actually lose he could even lose Nevada and Arizona and he still wins the election 270 to 268 so you know Pennsylvania everything weighs on Pennsylvania almost Donald Trump and Kamala Harris still paths to victory especially Trump Trump still has a path to victory without Pennsylvania however Pennsylvania is one of the most likely states to go to either candidate because of how split it is right now so it's very good for Kamala Harris when she gets polls like this which shows her from an A plus pollster with a pretty steady lead in the most critical battleground state Pennsylvania and again I think that she will win it Joe Biden won it by 1.2% in 2020 and what we have seen is a massive left-word trend in the suburbs the suburbs that dominate Pennsylvania elections and we are seeing massive left-ward trends across suburbs or in suburbs across the nation so if Pennsylvania can continue to trend to the left then the Democrats are in for a really good result in Pennsylvania so look at this Chester County Pennsylvania vote for Mitt Romney in 2012 by 0.2% he lost the state Obama won the state by 5% fast forward four years later Chester County went from 0.2 for Romney to 10 for Hillary Clinton now Donald Trump won the state so while the state as a whole trended seven points or six points I should say towards the Republicans Chester County became ten points more Democratic that you never see furthermore he went from ten points in 2016 to a stunning 17 points for Biden in 2020 suburbs eight Donald Trump and I believe that now more than ever with someone like Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket for the Democrats she will be able to really continue this trend possibly you know trend it more these at least Chester County trend it more towards the Democrats than we have seen in past elections in 2016 and 2020 so that's the state of the race right now in Pennsylvania hugely important state Kamala Harris definitely favored to win so thank you all

"His conviction that political leaders must gain the trust of rank-and-file members and not only rely on endorsements from union leadership is strengthened as a result of this, he claimed."

 here is showing a narrow two-point lead over former president Donald Trump that is well within the margin of error our political editor Dennis Welch is here now to break down those numbers yeah and when you say within the margin of error what you're basically saying statistically it's a dead heat now Arizona's family commissioned the survey in partnership with the local public affairs firm high ground and it reaffirms what we've been seeing so far that Arizona's 11 electoral college votes which could determine who wins the White House are still very much in play for both candidates here are the top line numbers they reveal Harris leading Trump 47 percent to 45 the results also reveal that 45 percent of those surveyed say they've already made up their mind to vote for Harris while 41 percent say they will definitely be voting for Trump I think one of the biggest takeaways here is that the race is very close and getting closer we've seen some surveys where Trump has a narrow lead we've seen others where Harris has a slight lead all of them have been within the margin of error Paul Bents is the longtime Arizona pollster who conducted the survey commissioned by Arizona's family his data reveals that Harris is doing a better job convincing voters to cross party lines at this point the vice president has convinced more than 12 percent of likely Republican voters to support her on the other hand Trump has only managed to convince 1.7 percent of Democratic voters to back his candidacy the two candidates are also evenly split with voters who are unaffiliated with any party while Trump is leading by double digits with independence what we're really seeing is that the Democrats are much more solidified behind their candidate they very much circled the wagons whereas Republicans are still struggling internally with at least a portion of their party Harris is also doing better than expected with voters 65 years and older the two candidates are evenly split at 48% among this reliably Republican block and like the previous two presidential cycles Trump is doing much better in rural parts of the state than Harris while the VP leads in Arizona's two most populous counties Maricopa and Pima and this survey was conducted at the end of last week another interesting data point here is the gender gap with Harris winning more than 52 percent of female voters to Trump's 40 percent while Trump is winning over 50 percent of male voters to Harris's 42 percent yes we've been saying for a long time it's going to come down to a couple hundred thousand voters in seven swing states of course Arizona very pivotal and the last presidential race was decided by like ten point five thousand here in Arizona yeah and if you look at the data here maybe it's not surprising but 86 percent are pretty much made up there they're locked in so 14 percent out there maybe maybe could be moving movable but you know it's going to be very close we knew that I know the election is a little over a month away but remember early voting starts next week so we're already in the middle of this and Dennis these were a likely voters not just registered voters yeah these were picked by basically on how often they vote these are people who are reliable voters out there they wanted to get a sense of who were they supporting how are they voting what's going to happen with them now that does leave open some room could there be an influx of new voters out there have Republicans identified voters who haven't typically voted in the last election cycle the last couple could Democrats do the same thing there's always a lot of questions to be answered well with these polls there's always things you can look at with a little suspicion just like every poll but as politicians have told me for years decades now the only poll that matters is in November yeah take a good thing they call this a snapshot in time which is what it is we like it it's interesting to see the breakdown Dennis thank you
"So that's like a you know, I mean like a 7.3 You know percent polling errors almost twice just for reference His lead was double in Wisconsin versus what it was in Pennsylvania But the amount he won by was basically double in the reverse order."
"And the, I guess the only other argument could be well considering there were way more Democrats that were afraid of the pandemic and wanted to stay home and vote in 2020."
So you've run this stand for nine years and you haven't voted?
Inflation is an issue.
Let's thank President Trump.
This is what he had to say in Detroit.
So what do you think about art in terms of freedom of speech and where art in freedom of speech lies right now in the current state of America?
"No matter where you are on the issues, how could you go along with that?"
Republicans thought they had really taken that off the map with Kamala Harris back on the ticket that has snapped back into battleground status in a pretty substantial way.
"He's from there, even though he represented a nearby, much smaller state, Delaware in the Senate."
What he is doing in the halls of Congress again.
But I think what what that clip shows you is how far some candidates are willing to go to genuflect to you know who?
They're not a representation of trans people.
"Well, for starters, if you get rid of one poll, either the Bloomberg poll or the Quinnipiac poll, just one of the two, it would go from Harris plus point five to probably Trump plus one, because both of these polls are clear outliers."
Monica Garcia has the night off Vice president Kamala Harris came back to battleground Arizona today to visit the southern border for the first time as the Democratic presidential nominee And just her second time as vice president She spent the day in Cochise County and it comes as voting is set to begin in Arizona in under two weeks Who's for Tucson's political specialist Eric Fink reports from Douglas?
I want to just get your reaction to something that Donald Trump says a lot about Jewish Americans.
"And that's why I think the Harris campaign, they're kind of freaking out because if Josh Shapiro wasn't enough to save them, how are you going to win?"
I got you sir.
" Okay, I know how much you love data and looking at things so I'm going to show you a map and that is the county and congressional map of the state of Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania is a swing state in this coming election and I want to show you what's going to happen on election night and that is all of the news stations that people will be watching, even on the internet, they will be getting reports of what the vote counts are for every single county across the country and as we're looking at the election returns coming in throughout the night on election night you start doing the math to anticipate what the outcome is going to be and the math involves what we know about how voters have voted in all the different counties in every single state."
It was Donald Trump who ripped away the rights of freedom of women in America.
We've got the competing town halls.
"This is actually a great policy debate to see them having, because it speaks to a real dollars and cents concern and an idea that's designed to help save, especially working class people, money."
You might have one view of it.
"And it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by a national guard or if really necessary, by the military."
"And in Philadelphia and most American cities, we could... Everybody could think of a place."
Bye-bye.
We need to get people out to vote for Donald Trump.
Let's go and just play this.
It's very personal to me.
Right now there's a lot of young people in Philadelphia and elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that are feeling that pressure.
"She had the other interview with the other guy who was a nice guy, I think from Philadelphia, from Pennsylvania."
Do you think that this is actually effective?
I originally painted this to give to Elon back in 2019.
"I think by and large, Kamala Harris is a decent person."
"So You know, I was mentioning something about the wicked demon abstein, you know what i'm saying?"
He's actually pretty good.
"Because this election, it's not just about picking a president."
"But that's okay, because what I have to say is going to make so much sense that even if I'm coughing a little bit, I think you're still going to catch what I'm saying here, because here in Arizona voting has already started."
"Like, of course you want to put everything you can into Pennsylvania."
" According to brand new data, it appears that Donald Trump's gonna get a huge victory in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania."
America has an electoral college system in which each state is given a number of votes roughly in line of the size of its population.
That's it.
"And then she's just going to be like, I grew up in a middle class family."

"Um, You know, I don't trust the media and what they say, you know My mom is a very educated woman and you know, she she believes in Trump and I believe in my mom So, you know, I'm here to support her, but I don't always trust what the media says So I'd rather hear it from the horse's mouth I want to ask you're obviously a female person of color that's some of the Democrats core constituency What would you say to possibly reach out to Democrats?"
The Trump doesn't have a message.
"For example, here was an off script moment earlier in the day where a UPS employee told Joe Biden quote, the only reason I have a pension is because of you."
"Nope, she'll be all right."
John Delano with CBS News Pittsburgh.
Any questions?
"So I have to tell you as someone who wore this nation's uniform proudly, as someone who now is the commander and chief of the Minnesota National Guard, the idea of sending U.S. military personnel against American citizens makes me sick to my stomach."

"The filmmakers follow a formula, so there are some predictability factors, but they know how to tell a scary story that will make you, well, scream."
In relationship to former President Trump.
Is this just a fluke?
"Trump's rant was not only factually incorrect, but also a blatant attempt to undermine the integrity of the electoral system."
I've seen you been faced a lot of opposition.
And that's the issue of fracking.
"Because I just think that when you think about it in terms of a historic American industry, not to mention what it means for the workforce in the economy of Pittsburgh, of Pennsylvania, but also from a national security perspective, it is important that we have U.S. manufacturing of U.S. Steel."
Trump flipped it.
You had a Republican mayor and John Giles who said what I think everyone in Arizona is thinking.
"They just want to gaslight all of us and say, it's not happening."

Things don't happen that way.

Some people are saying there is no lens that these politicians are not going to go to be able to get a seat at that position.
"I mean, it looks to be basically a dead even race for president."
"So Donald Trump said, I want to thank the United States Secret Service and all of the law enforcement for their rapid response to the UDA that took place in Butler, Pennsylvania."

"You saw the response from the White House today that President Biden is fully engaged in disaster response, he says, and he's working with the governors."
They're not being consistent.
"You've got Democrats, business leaders, military leaders, former Republicans were able to fill rooms even if Kamala Harris is not there in Pennsylvania to let people know what is at stake and why they should rally around Kamala Harris."
61% were graduates.
They've been giving us the Green New Deal.
And that's the type of ethos we need from the president who's going to be looking out for all Americans.
"It's kind of talked about on the pre-show and the starting soon screen, but Americans are very delusional about being in the middle class, and there's a lot of Americans that are definitely in the lower class, but they still want to believe that they're in the middle class because they have access to a lot of nice things that everybody has access to now."
Kamala Harris is making clear that she gets how to win Pennsylvania.
"Of all pollsters, this is from Marist."
"Pennsylvania, obviously, is where he's from."
I completely agree with you in terms of brat and all these kind of Gen Z marketing.

"A massive, massive change."
"They don't get nearly as much blowback from these people because the election mafia, they care about setting the narrative and they try to bully any pollster that does not exactly, you know, fit that narrative."
Trump's also touting his tariff policy and vowing to take on the CCP.
"We could also debate how much that's going to be and we got to get everybody voting, including men, because men voted, you know, rates that are a little bit less than women."
"If you don't know who they are outside of their state, sure, he could potentially help Harris win Pennsylvania."
He's on the slander.
"Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state, played a pivotal role in the 2016 and 2020 elections, drawing national attention and media coverage."

And we can do that by making Kamala Harris the president of the United States.
Current Harris compared to Biden in 2020?
"My video this morning I said, I believe Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will win this state by one to two points, but right now, a four point margin isn't far out from where it's closer to be."
Weijia Jang and Caitlin Huey Burns join us now.
I don't think presidents have a huge deal to do with gas prices.

They are planning to open over 100 field offices across the country.

"But now that Kamala is there, everything she's done has been really well scripted."
"It's only one point lead, but it's another pollster that's not bad."

"The real clear politics aggregate for Pennsylvania is exactly tied right now, even with Bloomberg Morning Consult throwing in a Harris plus five that's way out in left field."
People are calling it bizarre this morning.
"Even though there have been so many jokes about it on the media, it's actually a very serious situation."
"And they've urged Harris in private meetings to do more to turn out voters of color, which is strange because Kamala is a person of color."
And today we have to talk about the 2024 presidential election because Donald Trump's in a strong position to win the key swing state of Pennsylvania.
It's like a thing on the left is funny.

"We do still have two states to go though, up here in the Northeast."
"There are 50, at least 50 local offices for the Harris campaign."
What's working for him right now?

Does she need Josh Shapiro to secure the White House?
"And in the course of doing that, she's citing her various programs with respect to housing and the notion of first time mortgages."
"This is much more simpler than, oh yeah, by the way, Trump cannot afford to lose Wisconsin if he does."
It's very hard to say.
"You know, I think that that's definitely something that applies to your college age voters."
"That's interesting, right?"
"In the second poll, on the same dates, and also conducted by Fabrizio, Lee, and Associates with different 600 likely voters, Harris received 45% of the vote, while Trump also received 45%."
I know from my notes that Erie County was significant in 2016 and 2020.
So we'll see how Pennsylvania shakes out.
"You know, maybe North Carolina is like that."
"Hear now to talk more about that and the key role Pennsylvania is playing in this year's presidential race is Brandon McGinley, editorial page editor for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette."
The rural areas of Pennsylvania add another layer of complexity to the electoral calculus.
"So maybe you can criticize Donald Trump for that and say he's dumb, but there's a big difference between someone who's willing to sacrifice and someone who is stupid."

I'm not taking my sip of water.
So that's still a pretty favorable to poll to Trump.

And they also want labor to come out.
Lots of attacks by the Oz campaign on Federman's health.
"If you got in, would you probably just be smiling the whole time?"
It goes like this.

Nice too.
"Political watchers are now waiting for the much-touted October surprise, which could potentially tip the balance in the favor of either Trump or Harris drastically."
So can you talk about the American flag?
"And then to wrap up the states, up in New Hampshire, it does tend to be the most competitive state here in the Northeast, excluding Pennsylvania of course, though it has now voted blue in seven of the last eight cycles."
It happened.
And just repeat my question.
Still an advantage for Trump.
It's not the same as like Wisconsin.
These are deeply serious conditions that clearly impact her functioning.
And then they say they added the record number of jobs.
The Trump in Dorsey campaigning with Oz.
We've got a couple of months left and storms potentially brewing.
Donald Trump putting in the work also in Pennsylvania.
And why did you put the tape over Mike Pence's name there?
"RFK was actually polling pretty well, sort of between 8 and 12%, depending on the poll you looked at."
And some of them are distinctly partisan.
"Clearly, they don't share those concerns today."
And Donald Trump also put a Catholic from the Rust Belt on his ticket as well.
"That's Trump's base right there, right here."
"Yes Oh, we've been talking to locals about the issues that matter to them It seems like the cost of living really is one of them."
This trend may play a significant role in why the race remains so competitive in Pennsylvania.
"We're businessmen at the same time, though."
"Absolutely, sir."

"And by the way, I will give you one guess."
It's not quite as close as the presidential race.
But those are where the swing voters are.
Because they understand freedom is about being able to make the right choice for ourselves and our families.
It did in 2020 even in 2022.
I want to ask you about kind of the new tactic of Kamala Harris as well.
We're seeing Trump doing it and we're seeing the Harris-Wallis campaign doing this work.
Raise fresh alarms about vote counting delays and chaos in battleground states.
He cared more about winning an election than he did to actually solve the problem.

"Now, this change will impact nearly about nine million American citizens who reside overseas."
"Kamala Harris's clearest path to victory in November would be to win the three blue wall battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, barring any big shock results elsewhere."
Something like four and a half out of the seven days that week she's returning.
"This is, and I mean this sincerely, there could be no safer place in America right now than Butler, Pennsylvania, and on the farm show grounds right here, and everybody's so eagerly awaiting the next president, former President 45, to become the 47th president of the United States."
"Kamala Harris received 45% of the vote and Donald Trump, 48%."
That's in the vice president's head.
"And both of them, the big issue, and so you take a national issue, like the economy and inflation, and then you boil it down to each state issue."
"Harris is focusing on urban voters in cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, emphasizing issues like health care reform and climate action."
"The quote is, Pennsylvania is such a mess."
Vance and that was a political speech and what was notable in that speech is he said that former president Donald Trump took a bullet for democracy.
"Okay, check me on that."
"The third poll was conducted between September 26, 29 by the Trafalgar group among 1,090 likely voters."
Vote for Bob Casey and this whole incredible Pennsylvania Democratic ticket.
We're not to the conventions yet.

And I appreciate you all coming out the day before homecoming.
I'll be an old.
"Why does it seem like Democrats don't get credit or why does it seem like Republicans have been able to co-op this idea of family values when in fact, like your agenda with education, it's Democrats, it's people like you who are actually protecting the foundations of our family and protecting the future of this country by helping kids where they need it most, which is education, which is making sure they're fed."
"This razor-thin margin demonstrates that Pennsylvania is highly competitive, and Trump remains a formidable challenger capable of gaining ground."
What is that betrayal?
"You play the race card, where I beat people in the voting for her, got people like Joy Reese saying, you're going to look real weird if you don't vote democratic."
So Trump has got to be feeling pretty good right now.
She's letting all these people from other countries come over here.
"It doesn't matter what happens in the Southwest, where it's looking good for Trump in Arizona and Nevada."
This is the real reason we elect Trump.
"But aside from immigration, what Democrats have struggled to do when you talk to Latino voters is stress the message of how they're going to address the economy."
It's pretty interesting to me.
I was also surprised at how close Harris now is in these swing states.
"This is a dream administration for anybody who has truly believed in America, who has believed that we shouldn't be involved in these foreign wars, who believes that we need to clean our food up and have true health in this country, a return to health, making America healthy again."

It looks like Trump's in a very good position to win the state.
I don't agree with that.
I knew who I was standing with.
"So Raymond, I really appreciate this."
"Yeah, their sample was like a Biden plus seven sample."
This is me.
"I'm pretty sure they're going to put out a mental health campaign behind them, but if he was any other color, I guarantee it would have been something else."
So Philadelphia County in and of itself makes it virtually impossible for a Republican.
Trump almost did better than 2016.
So they've cut that down.
"But listen, you know, these races are closed, James."
"But if it's even just a 10 point shift towards Trump, he's got Pennsylvania."
Those are voters that Donald Trump hasn't had great success with.
"Donald Trump, meanwhile, is fighting to repeat his unexpected 2016 victory here when he became the first Republican in decades to win Pennsylvania."
Harris is at 51 percent unfavorable.

"Does she need to differentiate herself a little bit, show maybe a specific vision that is separate from the work that she had as vice president underneath President Biden?"

That's our responsibility.
It is the Lehigh Valley or Northeastern Pennsylvania.
I'm the father of IVF.
That's like triple or no quadruple the margin of victory that Biden had.

The magic narcissist reached the top of Mount Kilimanjaro.
"She's doing really well, hitting it out of the park."

"You know, I do a PG show."
"And look, one of the reasons, one of the reasons my opponent was was touted as as someone who could defeat me is because he could bring his personal wealth to this race."
"Now, along with that, right, why is she outreaching to rural areas of Pennsylvania?"
So you know in a couple of weeks time we'll see how accurate the polls are.
"Still, 49-49, it's a nail biter here, and it's not quite clear what's happening."
"Ask the question and you know, that's the question."
Good to be with you.
" Hello everyone, today I'm back with some surprising poll results that show just how tight the presidential race between the two candidates is."
Rally's over.
And I want to play that along with what we heard from the former president earlier today.
A demographic that could be pivotal in November.
Really appreciate it.
"Well, I think mathematically it's possible, but it's unlikely."
"But Ruben and I were talking to a remarkable group of men right before we came out, and we were talking about this, and somebody said, man, I'm just so tired of everybody being divided and mean and nasty."
"That's why the off year elections in particular is tough to pull because you don't know, man."

This election will be decided in the suburbs.
"Once a constant presence during his first presidential campaign, she has been conspicuously absent in recent months."
"Not me though, I have bad eyesight."
"You see, guys."
His brain is just not functioning.
"And then we'll look at another New York, a few New York Times polls here actually that have the race at Harris 50, Trump 47, Harris 49, Trump 45, Harris 50, Trump 47."
We've covered that ad nauseam.
"Well, it's going to take a little bit more than that."
We're a great nation.
That's the kind of stuff that resonates real well in Erie.
"If they come out with something on Trump in October or around the election, I'm not saying a hundred percent."
"Unfortunately, we are already beginning to see the lawsuits and the threats of lawsuits come from Donald Trump and his allies."
I've never seen anything like open.
"Even before I was running for President, I convened a bunch of black small business owners, all who were men."
"But in 2020, Joe Biden regained victory through strong campaigning in urban and suburban areas."
"If he spends this much time on the road, he's usually hitting multiple states, but he's in his home state of Scranton or he'll be going to Scranton, his home state of Pennsylvania before he heads to Pittsburgh and Philadelphia."

"Democrats taking more advantage of that option than Republicans of the former president did encourage his supporters over the weekend to vote early, vote by mail."
"Thank you, Zeke."
 President Biden and former President Trump won their respective primaries in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday.
And everybody's just easy going conversation.
This isn't John Fetterman saying he's going to vote for Trump.
"I mean, how do you find Harris plus four, Harris plus five right now?"
What do you say?
"So ideally you could say, oh yeah, Northampton County, there's a chance Northampton County does flip in favor for Kamala Harris."
"But Trump repeatedly refusing Harris, releasing her detailed medical records this weekend and asking Trump who would be the oldest president ever to take the oath of office why he isn't doing the same."
And you know the party has been shifting in this popular populist direction.
"So again, 2020 was decided by 80,000."
"It'll be like Detroit, our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president."
A weird church service.
"So for me to do anything, I need Republican votes and Democratic votes."
"And I'm being generous more than likely if you have pollsters like Quinnipiac and New York Times pushing out crap like this, there's a good chance the polling miss is closer to two to three points."
"Yeah, again, I think 2020, the polls were a lot closer than 2016."
She's got to do both simultaneously.
But you're not going to hear that from Republicans like David McCormick because they're afraid to condemn what he says when he insults people and denigrates even those who served our country.

Suburban voters.
"Now, I want to go over why this is a big deal that Harris is potentially in deep trouble in Pennsylvania."
The fact that Vance is going to be here is just amazing.
Are they perfect?
They could be right.
And it's an area that I think is up for grabs right now.
"You're either going to vote to restore Roe, which is the Women's Health Protection Act, or not."
The fact that Quinnipiac now has Harris only up by three.
He was in the New York courthouse yesterday.
Changing her position on fracking was absolutely essential.
"And so it's a long time coming that we've had this, to have this reform."
"And then if you're just joining me here, the reason I did this video is that Kamala Harris got really good polling Quinnipiac swing state polling that she's leading in Pennsylvania, 51, 45 over Trump leading in Michigan, 50 to 45 Wisconsin, according to Quinnipiac is much closer."
The world is watching.
And I'm just going to show you how important it is.
I would be shocked if the ultimate winner of the election wasn't the person who won Pennsylvania.
"Do you think that their messages are getting through to voters, in particular those who are still undecided?"
"In terms of my immediate plan, I will tell you a few of the following."
"And in his autobiography, someone who's been very, I would say bipartisan or trying to not criticize and critique, but he said that Joe Biden has been on the wrong side of American foreign policy for the last 50 years."
He's stumbling over his words.
"I mean, there was a new AP poll today that shows him with a seven percentage point advantage, 45 percent to 38 percent over Harris about who can better handle the economy."
This 11-point swing is a crucial factor in her overall lead in the state and speaks volumes about the changing dynamics of the American electorate.
"Donald Trump doing so much better in terms of voter registration, early voting, all of the counties compared to what's going on with the Democrats to where they're literally signing artillery shells in a factory in Pennsylvania that are being used to escalate or potential World War three scenario."
So the people that are saying that the book needs to belong in a historical trash heap or it's archaic.
That very same clip unearthed and broadcast by Fox News is now making waves on social media.
"All right, Joe Watkins, thank you so much for joining us, especially on a weekend."
"So yes, expect a lot of time spent here over the next 50 days."

There was a lot of craziness and silliness that we saw here.
"Yes, they had to relocate for a period, and we had security around the clock for many months."
"Yeah, sure."
"And with the latest poll numbers that we see out of Northeast Pennsylvania, if Kamala Harris is able to get over 40 percent, chances are they're going to win the state."
"If it was just a straight popular vote, we sort of know how this election would go."
"Back in 2020, he only had 44%."
"You don't explain a consistent trend of Republicans out-registered Democrats 2 to 1, 3 to 1."
He's a liability.
So you're definitely seeing Harris underperforming Clinton and Biden in big ways.
"As you mentioned, when you have people like President Bill Clinton walk the American people through that, the Democrats put up 50 million jobs, the Republicans only one million over the last 20 some years."
"A quick reminder, this was happening right when the Harris quote unquote surge was happening."
If I can get in just to see Trump.

"But he won not just by a little, he won by a lot, like six points in a major swing state."
So that means it was so valuable to them.
"So Pennsylvania, that is the choice in this election."
"Oh my God, I can't handle this."
And now people are not falling for it anymore.
"Obviously, it's gonna be a very close election, but everyone was claiming that Trump was secretly down by 15 points in Pennsylvania that he was gonna lose the election."
"You know, a lot of this divisive rhetoric and the false claims, like you said, that we've heard from the former president, seemed to have started when an Haitian immigrant struck a school bus."
"I don't, I'm petrified right now because I know it's almost as good as done that this man is going to get into office because of all the variables and how gullible, how stupid the American people are in mass."
Another issue that is high stakes this election is the abortion issue.
" you you I'm joined now by the man the myth of legend purple heart extraordinary American warrior Sean Parnell I mean you're the man saying that I'm just a middle class kid from western Pennsylvania that loves hanging out with the people you know it's amazing and I can see that here is you're really mixing it up with neighbors and friends You've run for Congress, you've run for the US Senate."
"And what we know is that the demographic of these working-class Catholics, you know, they leaned a little bit more Democrat back in the day."

Just say no more.
"It's not, it's not happening."
Will be at the heart of this contest.
"Fox News polls released last week showed Harris and Trump statistically tied in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin improvements over Biden's position in all three states."
"The Harris actually wants to do something for a country, and I'm excited about them wanting to do something for the people of this country."
"I think it's all bullshit And it reminds me of what he said earlier in the day in Scranton, Pennsylvania when he was talking about wind here play this clip The wind the wind it sounds so wonderful the wind the wind the wind is wind is bullshit."
"President Trump is somebody that I appreciate for his fight, his tenacity, his wisdom, and his ability to get things done."
"Bobby Eberle, Chip Franklin, really appreciate both of you."
Democrats are a worried lot because Kamala Harris' numbers appear to be declining.
Seven percent of that came from Montgomery County.
But they should be revoked.
There's people chatting and walking.
So many people adhere to the vice president's message that they're not going back.
"So listen, let me know what you think and in regards to this whole matter with Trump."
They complain that they've been left out of events and surrogates haven't even been deployed effectively.
"But one Berks County College professor says, forget all of that."
"And if rounding up and deporting millions of desperate people, many of them women and children, is the answer to everything?"
"But in these closing days, that has been notable as we're getting closer to the election."

"But that's not what you said, Danielle."
"There's there's about 50 percent are Democrats, about 25 percent are Republicans, and then 25 percent are independent, at least here in Pennsylvania."
And so part of what you do in a campaign is you take your message out there to the voters.
It's going out of business.
Wasn't that used against her running mate last time?
There's polling that showed today Kamala Harris up by a point.
Donald Trump just mowed them over.
I think we need to have higher standards for our candidates.
"Our latest DDHQ and the Hill polling average for today, it has Harris leading with 48.7% and Trump with 48%."
There's a Trump Trump.
"I mean, you've got Mayor Parker in Philadelphia."

Both candidates are holding dueling events in opposite ends of Pennsylvania today.
"First up, let's talk about Kamala Harris."
"But anyways, guys, thanks for watching this video."
"So let's just say, okay, Minnesota, Virginia, Harris wins those states, New Hampshire, Maine, whatever."
"Restaurant managing partner George Rivera at 43 has never voted in a presidential election before, but he says he's now all in for Trump."
You know I think that Kamala has a lot of good plans for the future and I think that since she wasn't the one that was mainly in charge you know even though she is vice president there is Congress and there is checks and balances so like she can't do everything I think that with her being more empowered president I think that she would be able to do a better job.
"Gwen, I mean, girl, you just killed it."
Thank you
Trump also taped a town hall with the Spanish-language network Univision in Miami.
I'll give you a little secret.
"People who are likely going to vote for Joe Biden are now not only voting for Kamala Harris, but they're also taking lawn signs, putting them on their lawn."
Her campaign confirmed that their first stop will be Philadelphia on Tuesday.
Can you speak on that a little bit?
"Natalie Brand, CBS News, Ardmore, Pennsylvania."
What really troubles me about that is J.D.
And so you've got a whole lot of money being spent against Bob Casey.
But I'm not on the line in the next election.
Don't believe a word Donald Trump says about abortion or IVF.
"And as you know, they voted the same way in every presidential elections since 1871."
Listen to this.
She was.
We can't do it without civilians and civilians can't do it without military.
"But it all comes down to Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania is essentially, you know, stuff might happen in North Carolina now, especially because of the hurricane."
"Jake Rosen, pleasure to have you in C57 today."
"He will do what he can to put people back in jail and to turn this into a police state, because, as you said, he is a weak man who is relying on the military power and his ability to undermine others to prop himself up."
" Even if you had a family member who acted like that, you might still love him, but you tell him you've got a problem, and you wouldn't put him in charge of anything."
"So before this poll was released, Harris was up by one point on average."
But it's a tough thing to do.
"Yeah, it's been interesting to see this because the Biden campaign has really followed the lead of the president here and the White House."
And that's why the data suggesting Trump's gonna probably win Pennsylvania is not good news for Harris.
Cost of labor is super high.
So it's like they're using the same playbook that was used against them.
Emerson.
You're a leader of the city?
I Believe it's good not only for the economy.
"Of course, the talking heads on the media, that's where they live, which is why they live in a bubble."

And Stahl correctly points out it wasn't a guarantee.
And 43 percent of the nation has a favorable view of Kamala Harris that is the highest it has been since July 20th of 2021.
Not a lot of people saw it.
"Whenever she says, I grew up in the middle class, I think of an SNL skit."
"This poll indicates that Trump maintains a slight lead, but the contest remains competitive."
Did Donald Trump lose?
It is.
And I think that's exactly where the president was going for.
"Yes, the same pollster that back in 2020 claimed Trump is gonna win Wisconsin by 17 points."
I'm doing it.
And it's a key state for Biden to hold onto.
And this would be.
"Harris could win every other state, which this map's not going to happen, but in this scenario, Trump's is victorious."
We're speaking for everybody here.
"Yeah, that's a good point."
Meanwhile Trump has a different problem.
"He knew that if we get in the habit of bending the truth to suit political expediency or party orthodoxy, our democracy can't work."
Explain it to the folks in Atlanta driving to work.
But I will say this.
I have hobbies.
They like the economy under Donald Trump.
"What is fracking, though?"
"Secretary Pete Buttigieg, someone who has a great future in the Democratic Party and President Biden's cabinet, someone that is close to the vice president and someone to keep an eye on."
"If not, even Josh Shapiro would be enough to win the presidency."
Grandma going to have to go back to work.
"We've we've seen this in the polling, by the way, undecideds are breaking for Trump by a lot this cycle."
"That was in the 80s, but within years the plant shut down, snuffing out thousands of jobs that were the town's economic lifeline."
"It does, and for voters, it's a reminder to be smart."
"So, Alyssa, can Trump win launching these kinds of very, very personal attacks against Kamala Harris?"
"In other words, talking about immigration, sure, which a lot of people say is a problem, but also saying that he's going to use the powers of the federal government to go after his political enemies."
They're showing Trump up.
The feeling in the ground is very high.
"All of a sudden after the debate, though, there's been a ton of Trump buying pressure and Trump is now up to 52% in Pennsylvania and the Democrats."
I heard today that it was an espionage case.
Sometimes families are getting divided.
"Caitlin, I'm so glad you mentioned that Fox poll showing that 61 percent of a favorable view for Shapiro."
"Well, you heard Nancy talk about this very effectively a few moments ago."
Let's take a listen to what she told me and then we'll talk about it on the other end.
"Now you know that they're nervous because if you take a crawl across the internet right now, what do you see?"
Suburban voters in Pennsylvania became a key group in the 2020 election when many shifted from supporting Trump to backing Joe Biden.
The election is fundamentally done.
That's the way we should do it.
There's a growing sense of nihilism from our generation that essentially feels frustrated because we see the system is broken.
And then we have the lies that Trump and his crack team of wing nuts have been spreading.
"It looks like Kamala's staff have, they're complaining that the local DNC apparatus in Pennsylvania is not really coordinating very well."
The Trump campaign's success in Pennsylvania is also indicative of a broader trend in the 2024 election cycle.
I came in and immediately.
How do people afford houses?
There's enough electoral map math there that makes it so that these states could truly be the ones that hand Kamala Harris the presidency.
So these kinds of polls look really good.
"The point is, if you elect Kamala and Tim, they will not be focused on their problems."
Vote Vote.
You were just there in the debate room and now with us.
"Mayor Abdullah Hamoud, thank you so much for speaking with us."

The literal brain rot in real life and online makes me want to fucking off myself because I know all this shit is just going to propel him into office and I told you I don't give a fuck about who you vote for.
That is also for all minorities.
What's the name that's under there?
"And look when I see clips like that and I read the comments that you send me a lot of the growth here at the Midas Touch Network is because this is a place where you have independence, where you have progressives and liberals, where you have real conservatives, where you have mainstream Republicans, where you have Democrats, where if your focus is normal."
"So a pretty significant divide among the genders, but how can you say that?"
F-A-N-I Fani.
Inflation's been here for three years now.
"Send them to me here or on Instagram, Brett Baer and Roseanne Barr down there responds."
And I think these polls are certainly pointing to that.
And J.D.
Do you remember?
When what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.
" Tomorrow, Vice President Harris travels to Pennsylvania for a campaign rally in Erie."
"Every major city in the US, like my, you know, my mom lives in New York, for example."
"And I think one of the reasons for that is just what I spoke about, the concentrated effort by very powerful forces, the wealthiest people on the planet Earth, descending upon Pennsylvania to hit both of us pretty hard."
"No, I haven't thought of that with transitive property."
"And if you look at the polling that I'm seeing the the bounce that Kamala Harris got leading up to the convention, that's already starting to diminish as people begin to wonder why she is not being more specific about public policy positions or she has continued to be wishy washy fracking being the most vivid example."
I don't know why he's imagining Kamala Harris as his wife in some weirdo bizarro thing that he shouldn't be talking about at all.
But it will be hard.
"Right now the talk is as Pennsylvania goes, so goes the nation."
"I mean, I think that the results of this next election will probably sway that scale, but I really like what you said about choosing to have hope."
"But when you look at our polling on the issue of immigration, he does leave Kamala Harris."
Just another sign of how important Pennsylvania is to this election into these campaigns.
So true.
I also want to share this particular one because it's not only funny people who are getting some stuff off of their chest and how to be very careful during this particular period.
They mostly come out at night.

He went into the lion's den.
So are Democrats right to question Trump's sincerity on this issue?
That starts with voting rights.
When I first heard that we were abandoning or we're withdrawing from Afghanistan and the the way it was happening I had my Kennedy moment It was very similar to when we decided to invade Iraq back under President Bush and when I saw that we were leaving that amount of high-tech equipment in the hands of our enemy and Later that that day or later that week.
This one food has been scientifically shown to devastate testosterone levels and most men have no idea what it is.
"That doesn't mean they were Biden voters back in 2020, but now they're voting for Harris."
So all these numbers were correct.
Donald Trump is somebody who says I don't want to take this issue to the national level.
Surely there's other metrics out there that show Harris having a victory.
That's real freedom.
They just were not sold on Biden at all either.
"With its 19 electoral votes, it is the state where former President Trump and Vice President Harris are spending the most time and money, a combined $436 million, between them and their allies."
Every one of these polls have shifted towards Trump and at the bare minimum by three points.

"Education, economy, and everyday concerns."
What you waiting for?

What did you make of that?

You never know what's coming next on this campaign trail.

"George, what are you learning?"

"There were a couple of people who needed medical assistance, and he commented on that."
"Do you believe it's tied in Pennsylvania, Selena?"
And I think that this is a huge misstep by Donald Trump because remember what voters found appealing about his message in 2016.

"Yeah, that's her back in 2019, back when she was telling the truth on the subject, but here's more of CNN turning on her."
So something caught me by surprise as I work to set up this story.
Those failed policies haven't worked in the four years that Donald Trump.
Do you think that she can move the needle enough to make that marginal difference to win?

"For example, if you look at what Kamala announced as a policy decision about doling out shops, about the one million unforgiven, small loans of twenty thousand dollars to the undeserved communities, she's trying to look at black men because the votes of the black men, because polls suggest that black men are drifting away from the Democrats."

"Yes, they're both in good shape."
"Let's head to a southern battleground state, right?"
"The polls are 100 percent spot on, no error, nothing."

He's talking about someone who comes to a rally to express their love and their commitment to our democracy.

"It was a good idea, right?"

"When you look at what's happened to this state, his argument is threefold."

"Michael Ruby â€“ $3 million â€“ $500,000 Michael Rubin, the co-owner of Fanatics and the Philadelphia 76ers, has pledged $3.5 million to support Harris' presidential bid."
The issues at play are deeply personal for many voters.
Huge.
I'd like to be in the center of the universe and I'm just not sure where that is.
A lot of what you might call negative attacks because this is that close.
Why does this matter?
"On the other hand, Oz lost."
I know a lot of people are pissed off at Republicans for not trying to pass that act earlier.
"And before this event, workers were out registering voters."
"Now, I would argue that that's a little bit high."
"Specifically, he believes that this presents a strategic contrast to the campaign that is currently being run by Donald Trump, who was previously the President of the United States."
"And as someone who was cast as unappealing to young black men when I ran, I will tell you that I received strong support, identical to the African-American gentleman who was on the ticket with me, Raphael Warnock."
That's called wealth creation.
And so you see how people evaluate those social issues plays out in how the vote breaks really dramatically.
"Once again, I am Steve Shives, sitting in for Dolomur all week."
"Good evening, Pennsylvania."
The old tank.
Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes could be decisive.
They were never going to win Florida.
I think a lot of people will be happy to see a Trump that's having fun on the trail because it indicates that he's more confident about where the election is going.
"After answering just a couple of questions amid multiple medical emergencies in the crowd, Donald Trump simply stood on stage for nearly 40 minutes as music played, doing nothing but swaying, looking disoriented and sometimes acting like he was conducting the music."
What is that saying?
Can you get into that a little bit more?
It's a joke.
And Donald Trump was heavily criticized by conducting diplomacy with Vladimir Putin and little rocket man in North Korea.
"You will be aware that rather than having very secured, small events that presidents have done in the past, he tends to have these rather larger events."
"And I say, yeah, yeah, it was good, because it was my economy that I gave to him."
The polls are close and former President Trump was back in our area last night trying to woo voters.
It's called Trumpy Trout.
Nikki Haley hasn't endorsed yet.
And we make more money.
But let's be more specific.
"And I said, do you like RFK Jr.?"
People were entering this area as early as one o'clock this afternoon.
We'll do that for you for the White House.
"That includes Latino men, which is why they just launched Ombre's for Harris out west, and black men, which is why you saw former President Obama speak directly to them when he was campaigning in Pittsburgh last week."
"As for Trump who courted the union in the past, the head of the union stated quote, I really don't give a F if he's pissed."
I mean Parnell would have been far better than Oz.
I think the way she can do that is stand up to the bully right at the other podium tonight and not take anything from him and show that she can stand up.
"Over 250,000 jobs created last month, unemployment fell, and just a few weeks ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, which helps."
The USSR doesn't even exist.
"They can't believe that she just, you know, fell out of a coconut tree, as it were, and has nothing to do with Joe Biden, his policies, his results, because she is his number two."
Literally every other pollster found the race tied.
She says she wouldn't change anything.
"And I know that sounds like double standard, but it's not."
"Now, if you challenge Trump or J.D."
He really does.
"They only need one seat if Donald Trump wins the White House, two seats if Kamala Harris wins."
So Wisconsin 8.6% lead for Biden and he only ended up winning by 0.7 So you can see that it was a absolutely massive or 7.9 on Election Day We'll say 7.9 and he she only win one by point seven so or it's 8.4 on Election Day So he only won by point seven.
Trump's case in New York is falling apart.
Even Hawaii has entered the mix for some reason and I'm not saying Trump can't dabble in some of these states from time to time.
That we don't have the same economic value that people who don't look like us have.
"Well, first of all, I think we basically know what a Kamala Harris presidency would focus on because there is kind of a communal bottom-up agenda from the Democratic Party really at all levels."
"Yeah, low generally."
I think women are going to decide this election.
"And while Mr. Biden won Reading by about 46 points in 2020, the city shifted 15 points to the right since 2016."
And the answer to that question is death.
Fox News is a reputable pollster and I do understand that it makes sense to sort of talk about that when you're discussing your election odds and when you're a presidential campaign.
"You know, if Zelensky is the greatest salesman in history, then the only better salesman has to be Vladimir Putin, who has successfully conned a US president, a former US president, and half of the country into thinking that he is favorable to the US."
She's not smart She's not smart then Donald Trump struggles to say this sentence where he's trying to lie about Automobile manufacturing which by the way is now at record levels Thanks to President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris's Infrastructure Act and inflation reduction act But Donald Trump can't even say the sentence right here here play this if we win This country will become the automobile Manufacturing place We are we will bring plants back at levels that haven't been seen for 50 years in this country Donald Trump then lies about Elon Musk's Starlink getting confiscated by the Biden administration Just more lies that he's spewing.
You want to do.
So good luck to all those involved.
"Even in this map, it shows Harris would win with this demographic shift."
"I think if you talk to people, you can talk to some undecided voters, and they're so kind of wishy-washy."
"This is a lie, man It needs to change."
So Pennsylvania is a huge one.
What I see right here is a rich white liberal.
"And in fact, there's numbers that back that up in Cambria County, where Donald Trump is speaking right now since 2019, when New York Times found it, I thought this was interesting, that they have actually six percent fewer jobs from 2019 to 2023."
"So Wisconsin does tilt blue here, and it does track with the overall average in Wisconsin that is Harris up exactly 3 points over Trump, based on a full 20-poll average."
"We've made historic investments in education, in public safety, in economic development."
The ABC is dying.
This is real clear politics.
Here's Governor Walz again.
Dr. Oz is going to be Dr. Oz.
And Trump himself has said that he's going to put a moratorium on all federal grants when he gets in office if he is elected.
"We don't know who's gonna win the state of Pennsylvania, but it's certainly a question that at this particular moment with the Pennsylvania polls getting tighter and tighter and tighter, that I'm certainly asking John."
"Again, I try to be as close to late September as possible, but Emerson in 2020, in the same time period, it was D plus five."
They have to deal with the fact that there are some men in the country that it's a harder sell to them than a male candidate is.
And that's how Trump thinks.
"Yeah, maybe Eli will pull up."
He's focused like a laser beam on cutting costs for folks.
"And a quick reminder that we were told for weeks now, no, for about a month now that Kamala Harris's best polling was going to happen in August."
"You can, well, you can think of America like that."
"Of course, you got to love your country."
JD Vance is taking away from the ticket.
So let's take a quick look at some trends from the past few months.
There are certainly some similarities.
They are.

You have the same we're not working well together.
And I don't really think she puts a lot at risk there because of the way the campaign's been trending.
"Well, this one's about 30% complete so far, this Elon Musk painting."
My part two video will be about do I think Trump getting shot at will change public opinion.
Do you or don't you?

"Always good to be with you, John."
"Now, there's all these criticisms that people will throw at Dr. Oz and you know, some of them I don't necessarily agree with."
"Well, John, first of all, it's always good to be with you."
He needs a rust belt state.
It was Walz who first dubbed the Republican nominees weird two weeks ago.
And I know you were talking to a pollster there or talking about the poll.
"So we are going, Meghan, to the VFW halls, meeting the veterans where they are."
You're a diversity hire.
But this is not what the polls the polls are saying right now.
"GS strategy group, from September 19 to 25, surveyed for 170 for likely voters."
And we see these statistics in other counties as well.
"I've seen you top the charts with your music and you do music on top of everything, on top of your reporting."
That's it's murder.
And you've got this happening today.
"Quinnipiac, The New York Times, Suffolk, Franklin and Marshall."
"Despite that, RCP still has Trump with a lead."
"No, he don't be."
"I met the president in 1968 when my father was working for his father in Brooklyn, New York."
Have you heard what the former president said last night at Israeli here in Pennsylvania?
He's talked about the strain on health care and housing.
Quinnipiac.
This is what I think many people have come to expect of Donald Trump.
He's not even a citizen.
It started with a Facebook post because I was on Facebook and then this popped up on my feed.
There are reports that the Haitian migrants were eating geese and ducks.
And she really gets that support from the Philadelphia caller counties.
"They went into the Biden camp in 2020 by 10 percentage points, as he did become the first Democrat to carry Virginia by a double-digit margin since 1944."
You got to love the people of this country.
That's a safe place for him.
"Ergo, she's tough on crime."
But I came expecting very strong opinions about that verdict.
That's what Donald Trump wants to spread that unhinged conspiracy that the whole name Pennsylvania will be changed.
I wonder why.
"This is a must-win situation, must-win."
" Now, perhaps the single biggest lie that Harris told her in the debate on Tuesday, a little bit under the radar, it came toward the end of the night when she said, quote, I've made very clear my position on fracking."
"Our politicians are supposed to be able to address the public in a safe environment and that is why there is so so much security, the security that you've described, people being wandered down, having their backs checked just to get into that area and you know we understand why tensions are so high, why people are so emotional there."
It's one of many efforts to sway the precious handful of undecided voters in an election that many say is too close to call.
And tell me why.
But apparently it's over for him despite the fact that Indiana is like an open primary and Biden's not really getting a lot of votes.
So this is the actual evidence that we have at time of filming.
And now to the surprise I encountered while trying to set up interviews for this story.
And I think she realizes that there are people that are going to come watch this.
But if you add all the Biden and Haley voters up together and you compare it to the Trump vote Donald Trump would technically win the state by 21 points based off of Trump and not Trump and that's giving all the Haley voters to Biden which is not entirely probably the way that it's going to go in November and you can extrapolate from this is the main point.
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 47% each.
"Harris's challenge lies not only in maintaining democratic turnout in these pivotal counties, but also in crafting messages that resonate with moderate and undecided voters who may feel alienated by the prevailing political discourse."
"What he's trying to do, specifically in this case, unclear, but we know he's been trying to sow doubts and suggest that he's not getting proper attention or credit for the size and popularity of his campaign."
"This issue is particularly sensitive for Pennsylvania's voters, and Harris's ability to defend her position could be a turning point in the election."
Was it last year?
And I know that seems very obvious.
"And if after you've gone through that and the folks who are unconvinced say, yeah, I don't know, I still like him, then you then I think you have to then say, yeah, but what about character?"
She was defensive.
"I mean, honestly, if he could think straight and just get out of his feelings for a minute, it's a bit of a layup."
I'm curious what you think that future of crypto looks like if God won the election.
"For the PBS NewsHour, I'm Lisa Desjardins in North Hampton County, Pennsylvania."
"It's in line with Atlas Intel, one of the most accurate pollsters in 2020."
"So many of the thousands of people here went to the ground as law enforcement, what appeared to be some form of paramilitary or Secret Service detail, rushed to the left side of the stage behind former President Trump."
But they don't always show up to vote.
A new Marist poll released Thursday shows former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are tied in the race for the White House.
You can see a little bit of it behind me.
"Now with voter registration, you have to be very careful."
He's listening to it.
We've had a historic pandemic that wreaked havoc on communities and businesses.
We're supposed to believe the same schools that make you sign a permission slip for your kids to go to the planetarium are taking them for sex change operations.
"But this is really, really huge that he's not going to be on the ballot in Pennsylvania, of course, because that would eat into the numbers for Kamala Harris."
"And for the last four years, she's been acceptable and for fracking."
It never was.
"Well, I think the real question is, is how come the Democrats are spending so much time and money here?"
I don't know why this car keeps waiting here.
What's got everyone so spooked?
The message that I have is I endorse you voting come November.
"And you're seeing not only in the national polling, but also here in Arizona, that there's been a, it's kind of a demographic shift."
Donald Trump is in the lead in Pennsylvania.
"So again, it's a nail biter."
And Trump was barely able to beat Harris in this poll by a single point.
"Oh, I'm so glad that he is okay."
Harris declined repeated request for an interview for this story.
"Or do you believe, based on your reporting, do you conclude that these issues are already baked in the legal challenges for Trump as they look at the Trump campaign?"
We are ready for a better story.
"Having a tool like ground news will help you sort through the bowl, especially in an election year."
"Okay, now I gotta know, what was the reaction in the room like?"
"Alright, so Kamala Harris, remember her?"
Is it possible the polls are actually spot on or in fact understate Harris a little bit?
He is okay.
They didn't.
"But I think at the end of the day, whatever the polls say on election day is gonna be your biggest guide."
"They don't, like I say, they don't want a felon to get back in there because we know he caused a insurrection and they're scared of a woman."
Still a little bit favorable to Republicans generally speaking.
I love our Constitution.
"I mean, what did she do in the span of three months?"
"And those earning about that threshold may over the US taxes, despite already having paid taxes in their host nation."
"I don't know if you heard this, but Marjorie Taylor-Green is pushing this bonkers idea that Democrats can somehow control the weather."
Apprehensive.
"Andrapal, thank you for your inputs."
The winner got 48%.
That's a big freaking deal because Notre Dame is a Catholic university.
My work is centered on ensuring that that next generation has far greater opportunity and far less difficulty and being as American as they can be.
"There's not, you know, many pathways to winning."
"And over the weekend, he talked about elite forces, National Guard, other things in our country being deployed to not only deport those suspected of or charged with or implicated in crimes, but others as well."

"But other swing states are just as, if not more, important when it comes time to cast your vote in November."
He's going back today.
I'm in OHA.
So you've got a lot of work Pennsylvania on your shoulders right now that you're carrying and you who are here volunteering to do this work.
And Jeff had just finished his speech and he was coming in there to decompress for a second before he went back out.
"Harris even took a jab at Trump, criticizing him for downplaying the significance of abortion rights."
"One good example, one simple example is I feel like anyone can go shopping at any budget and you can collect a bunch of garbage even if you are poor."
I'm not weird.
"And Tim Ryan kind of trying to appeal to those voters, even though Vance did kind of underperform in this part of the district."
Where eating into those margins both in the city of Pittsburgh but really Allegheny County these areas that Harris needs a maximum voters in order to win Pennsylvania.
It's it's ridiculous.
She's been leading in the five way for a little bit period of time.
"He's not being transparent, so check this out."
Let's face it.
"Now, let's see here."
And President Biden and Vice President Harris were down in North Carolina meeting with local officials and comforting families.
"You know, you've run what now six or seven statewide elections that you've that you've won."
"Marcus Conte reporting live from the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Trump rally."
They get up at the crack of dawn to help us figure out what jacket to wear.
"He's maintaining a big lead, which I didn't even expect."
"And finally, a town in California was on edge after someone reported a mountain lion sighting on their ring camera."
"But as Trump has said, he is who he is, and this is how he's going to be talking to voters, Gio."
"He says, Kamala's face."
reboot
I don't like either candidate.
"In addition to the failure of the Trump administration to deliver a comprehensive health care plan, promote sustained job creation, and rebuild the nation's infrastructure, Shapiro was critical of Trump's record for a number of other reasons as well."
"Said, cut him in."
It was an amazing event.
So former President Donald Trump returning to battleground Georgia today for two campaign events.
"That advantage of D over R has been narrowed down to 333,000."
"Vice President Kamala Harris, a trailblazer in her own right, brings a wealth of experience to the political stage."
They're not really behind Donald Trump.
"And she certainly and the Biden administration, to be fair, has kept the Trump tariffs in place and even doubled down on some of them."
Was there anything in particular that either said to the other that surprised you?
She's got a great track record.
"The other day I saw her get up and say we will do this, we will do that, we're gonna, why didn't they do it four years ago?"
He's fighting for you.
"Additionally, Shapiro took advantage of the occasion to showcase his own accomplishments in the state of Pennsylvania, particularly his work on education reform, which he has accomplished across the political spectrum."
So that's a big deal.
And I watch his campaign rallies.
"I just don't see how you lose Pennsylvania or win Pennsylvania, but somehow lose the presidency at that point."
That's what the individual looks like.
They let the police and security know and nothing was done.
She's there because she wants to boost her platform of small businesses.
"So in some of these states you actually need not just a certain amount of signatures, but I guess you need some number of electors to guarantee to pledge their vote for you."
What do you think is happening with the average Catholic in Wisconsin and in Pennsylvania?
Leave the liberality alone.
Take a look at the polling numbers out in Pennsylvania.
"All the institutions lied to you saying like there were this many jobs and really, they had to adjust the numbers down."
"Okay, so I'll show you where to write."
It's the populist messaging that really helped you in 2016.
"Okay, immigration."
"And I think she has to use that extraordinaryness, you know, in her campaign."
"Okay, we'll start with the economy."
Who's the best person for me?
Unusual.
And I think it looks favorable for the vice president.
So Bob Casey will be there in Wilkes-Barre.
I used to live alone before I knew you.
That's not the point.
Kamala Harris received 52% of the vote and Donald Trump 47%.
He's calling her comrade Kamala now because she's trying to institute communism.
"So we're at the DNC right now, as you can tell, right?"
"They called him weird and he's like, they call me weird."
That's how I want America to be.
We're obviously outside of a polling location now as Georgia begins with its second day of early voting.
"Walz and Harris head to Michigan and Wisconsin and I'm told that it is in the Midwest where Walz is from, that the campaign believes he can be the most helpful, especially since the Republican vice presidential nominee is from the Midwest as well."
Like every other major party candidate has done for more than half a century.
Read the documents that Johns Hopkins is putting out that patents on weaponized nanotechnology.
"The other thing to point out about Pennsylvania is, you know, Trump just had his giant rally in Butler, Pennsylvania with Elon Musk."
So who are you going to vote for?
"And my favorite is the Trump iconic black mug, where you get the Trump iconic bullet American flag design on the front."
"Cooper's interest in urban development and affordable housing drives his support for Harris, who has outlined plans to address the housing crisis in America."
Every vote counts though.
I was saying that they're not from America.
We are doing a special for a limited time.
"But as Reuben mentioned, you need to make a plan."
Recently Fox released their national poll finding Donald Trump up 50 to 48 over Kamala Harris.
They feel like that was the key part of his success here in the Keystone State in 2016 and it's something they want to be able to replicate this time.
It's very hot out today.
And who can really say what's going to happen?
"Do you think it's going to be Shapiro at this point, Mike?"
And then the media is going to lash out and call us all racist.
"On the RCP average right now, Trump is up by two points."
And there has not been an armistice.
That's something that in the past Kamala Harris has been opposed to.
He just got a drug problem.
"I mean, we saw that the Republican base and the Republican ticket, specifically Donald Trump, oversaw levels of attacks they could not do correctly against Kamala Harris."
I can't remember what it was.
They are registering.
"Yeah, definitely a little bit different."
And there's a reason because there are votes there.
"Even Rasmussen's second to last poll, they had Biden up by three."
We are arriving at one of the hottest spots in the race for the White House in 2024.
"But that without without a question in my mind, it has nothing to do with liking him or not liking him."

I absolutely love him.
"In reality, Euquevah has long been a bipartisan effort to ensure that military members, many of whom are stationed in conflict zones, can exercise their right to vote."
A whole lot of Eagles and Steelers in your fantasy draft.

"In my race, I think Kamala Harris is about close to that."
"The shit talking would be endless right now but lo and behold the shooter is not black, not brown, not Muslim, not illegal, not trans, and not a drag queen."
So you've been in Congress for 11 years now.
Like do your research and then just pick what niggas talk about.
So how within the next 65 days does either of these candidates actually pull ahead?
But this is a moment that is going to change the trajectory of this campaign.
"But also if you want to support the channel, you can do so by buying the merchandise from shop.readygopolitics.com which is also on the website."
So terrible.
"And so I think that's what you're hearing from folks who are going towards a third party candidate, be it Stein or someone else."
Move.
He's not gonna back down.
"Let me ask you about that, because I know you've been covering the Trump campaign for a long time."
"The tunes are absolutely powerful, but the mere fact he chose that right there."
We're dead.
"And whether Governor Shapiro gets the not or not, what is clear is he has the support from voters we spoke with Josh Sanders, CBS News Philadelphia."
"Yeah, probably not."
"That's received a lot of backlash from Republicans, as well as Democrats."
"And they can't always predict the amount of turnout of those Trump supporters who might not be politically active in any other context, except when Trump is on the ballot."
"So like, yeah, we're all in the same boat here."
The great controversy above all the other books needs to be heard today.
This state is also where Trump held an exclusive meeting with Sean Hannity on Fox News.
Hins are things that look like the the bandage that the former president had over his ear.
"It's the age thing, right?"
"I think that if there's a tie in Pennsylvania, like in the statistical polling, I think that Trump will win."
It's possible.
"And we know, according to polling, according to, you know, some very preliminary early data, that we have in North Carolina and Georgia, seems like the turnout dynamic is going to give Donald Trump a boost in those two states."
"So it shouldn't shock anyone that the polls are within a point or so, or even a dead heat."
"Here in 2024 though, Trump had polled within striking distance, or even ahead of Biden in Virginia at times this cycle."
And what would you hope to take away from this whole situation after the rally is all said and done?
And we will win.
"And I thought something very interesting when you take the same poll, such as Emerson, they found Trump right now up by a point compared to their same poll back in 2020 in Pennsylvania."
"But one thing's for sure, Pennsylvania is shaping up to be the battleground of battlegrounds in 2024. Who do you think will win Pennsylvania in 2024, Trump or Harris?"
They didn't have anything.
I've been canceled for it.
I think that some of these markets are definitely being manipulated by ideological people who do not mind spending money.
I have doubts about her.
They want an improved surrogate operation.
This was a super no margin for Trump and Clinton.
"And joining us now to dive into the most recent polls from Pennsylvania is Nathaniel Rakic, your senior elections analyst for ABC's 538."
"And they are very worried that that is going to translate into low voter turnout, which is why you see this huge effort tonight and in the days ahead on this particular group."
And as we've worked to deliver real results with the good people here in Pennsylvania.
It sounds like the cookie poll has been great.
"And ultimately, that's not what Biden has done."
And that's the issue that you're going to likely see keep coming up.
I'm sorry to me.
"I'm sorry, I can't do that."
"I'm not gagging because the state of the world has rendered me just ungaggable at this point, but a single sip of McDonald's Sprite, an Altoid, one Altoid, a whiff of Fireball whiskey, a swig of green Listerine, a flight of stairs up or down, 15 minutes, 10 minutes standing on a sidewalk in Las Vegas this week."
Being the future president of the United States.
It doesn't.
Read the clues.
I love you back.
I'm sure later tonight I'll be on going over more details.
"Doesn't exactly inspire confidence, does it?"
"He is the political editor of KDKA, our station in Pittsburgh."
But he did not take questions earlier as Governor Shapiro and Vice President Harris were said to be meeting Sunday in the nation's capital voters in his hometown weighed in on a potential Harris Shapiro ticket.
That's where she can turn the page on the last few years and talk about things that Joe Biden as the incumbent president cannot in time.
We appreciate your time.
He doesn't give a rat's ass about you and your grocery bill.
"We believe in the freedom to provide for our families if we're willing to work, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to send our kids to school without worrying if they'll come home safely."
"As of right now, we are gathering more details."
Whether it's the economy.
Even local Republicans said it was not true and now the people of Florida are dealing with another devastating storm and I want you to watch what happens over the next few days just like the last time.
Is that a direct translation to a vote for Biden?
I will not ban fracking.
"Republican strategist Matt Clink, thank you so much for joining us tonight."
Even Harry Enten over at CNN was covering that on CNN yesterday.
I don't want they call the wife.
Is he holding out for 2024?
Do you really believe Michigan's going to vote Republican?
"It's like 1.7 Harris lead in terms of the net average, according to real clear politics."
I could see that.
Inflation in Pennsylvania is actually higher than the national average.
"She's been hitting the ground hard, especially focusing on black men voters."
"And looking at the enthusiasm, 70 percent of likely voters supporting Harris are enthusiastic about supporting Harris, which is up from 66 percent in August."
"He contrasted this with figures such as Ohio Senator G.D. Vance, who, despite obtaining endorsements from union leadership, has struggled to connect with the individuals he claims to serve."
I love these shots inside.
You can't kill me.
"So again, easiest way to do it for Harris is to go to Michigan and Wisconsin and win them both."
This number is going to change.
Look at this.
So how is he going to fix that?
"Stahl makes the case and I believe he's right that were it not for Trump's endorsement of Oz, McCormick would have won the primary."
"No idea."""
The campaign in the coming months is expected to continue intensifying with more resources and time invested in this state.
You got all these opinions.
"Go ahead, please."
But we'll see what happens.
"Thank you all for watching, by the way."
But everywhere else is a very good chance she'll bleed support on net.
The race is getting contentious.
"Fertilizer is up 30 to 60 percent in 2024, not to mention the increase in seed cost, the fuel, the parts and supplies, and man hours for planting."
You should just be more optimistic.
This is something that we have not really seen him do yet with a single state.
Will this Trump campaign?
That was very clear in those sound bites.
The eventual winner of these states could very well determine who sits in the White House come January 2025.
What are the odds?
"In order for people to feel, in order for Democrats to feel comfortable about Bob Casey Jr. beating McCormick in the Pennsylvania Senate race, Democrats need to have banked around 335,000 votes."
Let's take a look at it once again on our decision desk HQ forecast map.
As Cuban Americans make up a significant portion of the Hispanic electorate.
"But I think Kamala is picking up a pretty big anyone but Trump vote that Joe Biden simply couldn't because people were thinking, well, one guy's a bit out there and a bit crazy and a bit offensive and a bit of a cowboy."
"It was in the news, the child comet and it was spoken of the the dragon."
I'm doing it for the people that are close to me.
So I think Kamala Harris needs to deliver that message to the American people and deliver that message to young voters.
Arizonans are rejecting Donald Trump and his failed leadership.
"Next, Donald Trump talks about the federal criminal cases where he's a criminal defendant."
Here's what I can tell you.
I think there's a lot of talk on the right about the left being very woke and you know I think it's definitely true for some people but a lot of us are just kind of trying to prioritize human rights and trying to make sure that we have respect for others and I think that a lot of what you see that seems very extreme on the left is not representative of all of us.
It will be liberated.
Former President Trump appeared in two televised town halls.
They're going to vote Democrat.
It's critical for both campaigns.
I think she's doing it in a lot of reasons because the race is that close.
You would just need Nevada.
"These migrants had come to Springfield at the town's request, as the local economy was struggling, and they were in need of workers."
"Now, what he is willing to do is to lie about his intentions."
I also wanted to take a moment out and read the statement that Trump made on Twitter.
"I'm so proud, uh, that they have my back and I have theirs in my office in Harrisburg and our state capital."
"We were talking to Mike Noble, CEO and founder of Noble Predictive Insights."
Notice how all of these people are having to readjust their numbers down.
"He basically was, especially in Bush's first term, he was seen as basically like the co-president."
Now what will happen is throughout the whole night on election night every single one of these counties will be all of them through all state they will be reporting in their election counts from all of the polling stations and all of these counties over here will be the first to report in and so as you're watching whatever station they'll be showing that Pennsylvania is red red red red red and everybody will start freaking out and that's because so many of these counties are reporting in and they're all reporting in huge numbers for Donald Trump but here's what you have to understand about Pennsylvania is that the total vote count in Pennsylvania in 2020 was about 6.9 million total votes cast and 43.2 percent of them came from this county and these counties right here.
And I think a lot of Pennsylvanians understand authenticity.
He also mentioned that these actions are being taken by Democrats.
But you talk about Pennsylvania.
"Well, there's no question, Jake, the reason he is saying these things that and also the fact that he now wants the government to pay for IVF treatments, which Catholic Southern Baptist, a lot of pro-life anti-abortion rights people believe is the equivalent of abortion, because there are many embryos that get discarded."
"He mocked her appearance, laugh, and debating skills while criticizing her economic proposals."
The battle for the ones who haven't decided yet is underway.
"When you do that, we'll teach Donald Trump and extreme migrant Republicans a valuable lesson."
He'd like to come in and buy donuts.
You live in a toss-up nation where every election brings coin toss close fights to run American government.
"Over the weekend, Kamala Harris released a summary of her medical records revealing that she is quote, in excellent health and adding quote, she possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency to include those as chief executive head of state and commander in chief."
Most users said that they did not need anyone to tell them whom they should be voting for.
"I feel like maybe if they lower the job age, they might have better job rates."
Kamala Harris is ahead by 2.3 percent.
"Reporting from Atlanta Georgia, Iris Tao and Hyli News."
"And again, raising questions about Donald Trump's mental fitness."
"This time, as you say, he is still under criminal charges here in Fulton County for that."
One of the stories that you wrote had to do with an interesting quirk in Pennsylvania's impact on the Electoral College.
"Democrats are asking, urging the vice president to sharpen her economic message, get more specific, get more, lean into it a little bit more."
"My first day in office, I signed an executive order doing away with the college degree requirement for 92% of state government jobs, opening up the doors of opportunity for people not based on an arbitrary degree requirement, but whether they did the skills in the military, in a trade union, you name it, to do the job, making sure that we're bringing VOTEC back to our classrooms, investing in union apprenticeship programs, making sure that middle class families keep more money in their pocket because we're cutting taxes along with all the other work that's being done at the federal level."
"When she goes into a debate, take out her earrings."
We believe in the freedom to provide for our families if we're willing to work.
" The Donald Trump song at his rally, Hallelujah, and the other songs that he chose."
"I'd probably vote for her in the primary at this point, but it is what it is."
I'm from there.
So a lot of people think that Rasmussen is this right leaning pollster and it does have a right lean.
"If that's the case, that Republicans cracked 30%, Democrats aren't deep trouble here because yes, it's true that Democrats are going to vote more on election day."
Donald Trump would break 50% in Pennsylvania.
"Donald Trump struggles with nearly all of those groups of voters, and in 2016, he was able to win over voters with a populist message, right?"
He did vigorous campaign.
This type of behavior should not be tolerated ever.
"Harris 48, Trump 47."
It's swung both ways.
And these are first second time voters.
Am I do you want to?
"Yeah, seriously, man."
"Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, very different."
So two wildly different strategies.
That is something she said she was in favor of in 2019.
Trump Vance.
I thought that was that was the American spirit right there.
"And so when you're living this lie, when you're like acting out a part, and by the way, you're not a very good actor, you're going to have fails like what he had at the donut shop."
"But listen, whatever you could do, get out there."
I was happy that it was handed over to the seats.
"Scale a very optimistic, a very pessimistic."
Did you know that there are 33 million businesses in this country?
She needs to.
So that's my work is really centered around around making sure my residents have the comfort and support that they need in these dire times.
"By upholding these provisions, the court effectively reinforces the procedures that many Republicans believe are essential for safeguarding the integrity of elections."
There you have it.
"If you're just tuning in, I am going to go."
Harris said that Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged.
"And remember, Pennsylvania polling back in 2020, back in 2016 at this exact same time."
I made that very clear in 2020.
I suppose.
It's exactly 220.
He's a very important person.
"We're lucky, we're on East Coast time."
"The stark contrast between the Democratic stronghold of Philadelphia, a vibrant urban center characterized by its diverse and progressive population, and the Republican-leaning rural areas illustrates the pressing need for Harris to engage effectively with both segments of the electorate."
And I take my lead from them and I lean on them and these moments of difficulty because that's what Dearborn does.
So thank you guys so much for watching this video.
"This is what we talked about a lot on Friday, right?"
"I'm aware of the American people want a solution that puts an end to the empty political rhetoric, which has failed to do anything for so long."
But I do remember that.
It might ultimately come down to which candidate can deliver a new RV to Clarence Thomas first.
"It doesn't matter if you vote for them or not, like them or not."
"And she started going on a rant and he said, ma'am, ma'am, hold on a second."
"And most importantly, vote for Trump."
I just wonder if it'll be enough.

"He just stood there on the stage, kind of swaying, dancing a little bit to some of his favorite songs from Pavarotti, from Guns N' Roses, and no one could quite understand even some puzzled faces in the room about what exactly was going on."
That's what I did.
Kind of.
We have to talk with the 2024 presidential election because it appears that Donald Trump's in a great position to win the swing state of Pennsylvania.

His numbers maintain exactly where they will likely be.

The Trump mugshot design.

"Both candidates are preparing rigorously, knowing that their performance could make or break their campaign."
But he's winning Hispanic 62 percent to 36 percent.
You heard that right.
How about that?
They've got to do something because black men are not in love with Kamala even though Obama came out and said she's basically your Kamala.
"So despite of these incidents, open AI has confirmed that none of the efforts to influence global elections have gained significant traction or large audiences."
She's not intelligent.
"We're all watching it, however, because DeSantis is someone that, you know, clearly has ambitions beyond the governorship."
He did cancel his trip so he could be here to cover that story.
"You only win the state by 80, 90 K. It's not an apples to apples comparison, but it still does make sense that if they had such a bigger voter registration advantage and they were only able to win the state by like a point now imagine considering how much it's condensed."
We would expect Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to go to Trump.
And our ABC News Ipsos polling shows a big 17 point gender gap with Trump leading among men with eight points and Harris leading among women with nine points.

"The Democrat is averaging at about 49.7%, while her Republican rival is at about 46.3%."
"The source added, okay."
"So if her best polls are Harris plus one from Signal, which I know is Republican pollster, but they tend to be accurate more often than not."
And I've been proud to be one of the leaders in this effort.
Here is what Trump said about that.
"If he wins the Catholic vote, especially by a lot more than likely he wins the presidency."
I just felt her Passion response and that she would carry it out and that resonated with you in the moment.
That's about 30% of the GOP casting a protest vote against Donald Trump.

Then people who get the Medal of Honor risk their lives and serve in the military.

Donald Trump is winning Pennsylvania.
They told her.
"The company has said that this year till date, it has managed to fall 20 such attempts, including a set of chat GPT accounts in August that were used to produce articles on topics that included the 2024 US elections."
And it's not just about getting information either.
"I am here to ask you to vote for my friend and your outstanding congressman, Raul Grijalva."
And I know I've gotten a lot of questions about how the hurricane is going to impact the election in North Carolina.
Haley's been out for a long time.
"But it's seemingly that really maybe it affected it a little bit, but we've seen Trump shoot right back up in terms of the betting and those Republican internal polls are not going to be input onto real clear politics or anything like that."
I'm telling you.
I'm coming back.
"Listen, potent pondering, get in the comments."
Look at that beautiful sign.
"Genuinely, no chirping, no joke."
They each backed Trump or Joe Biden in 2020 by at least 10 percentage points.
He'd have a sizable lead in Pennsylvania.

Friedman sees Harris as a leader who understands the importance of innovation in the digital age and supports her vision of a more secure and technologically advanced America.
That's the public polling.
It's a lot of merchandise and merchandise.
We win the whole.
"The need for authentic leadership was highlighted, as voters seek authenticity and respect in their leaders."
"A lot of these polls, they're a little afraid to show a lead one way or another."

Her whole centrist moderate stance is just a facade.
"issue made up by I don't know the D.C. consulting class, the deep state, the propaganda press."
But I'll be back with some more polling data as soon as it comes out.
There would be quite the symbolic nature of them winning versus Trump.
It's a valid concern for sure.
"RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, take it or leave it?"
"Lindsey, there's no question both these campaigns view Pennsylvania as nearly a must-win state, but these two places they've gone on opposite corners in the northwest corner and in the southeast corner are very different areas."
"It's a question of whether he may say now that that's what he wants, but could something like that work its way through one or both houses of Congress?"
"And it came across as though labor was behind her, right?"
An astronaut and a fighter pilot.
We're thrilled to be able to support what we see is a wonderful leader for this country.
Look at this man.
And that means spending time with folks in the communities where they live.
"And within that several thousand votes, we saw some polling that came out from the New York Times Sienna poll, which is generally kind of respected as one of the one of the better polls out there, which showed that Harris has a four point lead on Trump, which but at the same time, it said that they were tied nationally."
How do you bridge the divide in this country?
It goes down as safe blue here.
"I'm going to go ahead and just say some, speak some truths that you don't mind."
I think that would be sort of the break-even point.
"Yeah, I mean, I think Pennsylvania is absolutely a must-win state for Joe Biden in particular."
So we are running like I.E.
"Remember, it was only two weeks ago that President Biden exited the race and that the party rallied behind Harris to replace him at the top of the ticket."
You guys can check it out.
It's going to be way too expensive under her proposed tax increase.
Do people really believe that Kamala Harris has the same appeal to these voters that Joe Biden did the exact same appeal?
That's what they're trying to make.
"And so I literally asked the source while I was talking to them, what sense does it make to reach out to Haley supporters when you have sixty thousand members of your party not voting for you?"
But this is the one thing we could do that would change Pennsylvania's future.
We are being kept about a half a mile away while investigators do this really important work.
I think both of these states are going to vote fairly similar high working class white population in the state of Wisconsin trending to the red.
"I don't know, somehow."
"No, that's not it."
"Natasha, back to you."
"Truthfully, whatever they're smoking, I'd like to have some of it."
So our members vote on local candidates.
News Nation's Kelly Meyer joins us now.
"May I finish responding, please?"
"Former President Donald Trump, meantime, and is running mate Senator JD Vance, don't have any events today, but Trump returns to Pennsylvania on Wednesday."
That is fine for Pennsylvania.
You can see them looking at their phone right there here.
I want to travel to work in one.
I think the mainstream left-wing media has a fair bit to do with that.
It's going to be a tough fight.
They didn't want me to share the entire interview.
" Join us now, Mike Allen, co-founder of Axios."
"A town hall in Oaks, Pennsylvania, swing state, obviously, always crucial."

Deeper issues?
"And then, after that, switched and voted to form President Trump in 2016, before going back to President Biden in 2020."
But the law is clear.
Let me reframe the question.
It's not someone who seen the light.
"Folks like me, I've always adjusted my sample and applied in a little extra weight, you know, to make sure that Republicans are equitably, not equally necessarily, but equitably represented to reflect, you know, how people have voted in presidential elections."
"You're looking at Nydia Cavazos in Detroit, following the Harris campaign on the left."
What a dope but absolutely insanely unhinged.
"So that has major implications going forward, especially when you have election deniers in these very critical races."

"And that's with Dems being plus three, according to Gallup, 2016 Dems were plus six Trump nearly one."

"Terry, forgive me, we have a little bit of breaking news that I just want to get in here, which is that before he took that stage behind you, former President Trump did an interview with Fox News and he gave his clearest answer yet on how he would vote on his home state's ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights into that state constitution and essentially repeal a current Florida state law that bans abortions after six weeks, which is before most women know that they are pregnant."
We say 48 for Casey.
Clinton plus nine.
Why is Harris made such strides in the suburbs?
And Dr. Oz is just an unproven product because who knows what he's been saying his entire career.
What is the Trump rationale here?
"That was the only place they could find shade sucking in the fumes from the diesel generators, the fetid porta potties."
"Joining us now is Caitlin Becker, who is live in Bucks County."
"And when he's not complaining, he's trying to sell you stuff."
I had no idea that that was the next thing in there.
She definitely need to talk to black males.
I'm not sure that Harris.
"Tucson, we do not need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails."
"This is really just it's a tragic moment and when you were there, when it happened Scott, did you know you mentioned it sounded like firecrackers."
He will use the IRS to go after people.
But we were for Bernie Sanders and we weren't for Bernie Sanders because he was hot.
"But for some reason, they can be in the aggregate and be legitimized."
"And so those voters who have long supported more centrist Republicans in different respects, maybe a little bit wary of Trump, but do you believe they're going to stay home?"
"Look, I think it's a it's a valid concern."
"But that being said, there was the the idea was like regardless of where you put the filibuster, like they reduced the filibuster, you know, from 66 to 60, I think during that era, regardless of where you put the filibuster, a guy like Lieberman is going to put himself as the 59th or 60th vote."
"We have Bob Costa in Pennsylvania, who will be joining us from the road."
I'm not going to get triggered by this thing.
"We're getting We'll be right back Or no, actually we'll keep going we're getting the first reaction to debate from our focus group from voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Phil Mattingly is with them in Erie, Pennsylvania."
The variation in polling data across different areas reflects the state's diverse political landscape.
"I think when you say she's run a flawless campaign, it's a mistake free one, I guess is a better way."
Compressors been working so hard.
But that honeymoon period is clearly over and it's ended.
It's very interesting.
Am I wrong?
"I think he's a great pick, but he's not an astronaut."
You all see the signs behind him and you can also text MAP to 5 1 0 4 1.
I wanted to get what's your reaction to many Democrats?
"Even Trump Republicans, as Laura mentioned, are responding quickly."
They can't you can't kill a baby after it's born.
I guess you could argue that's a possibility.
"And before this election, it was trying to close off the border, preventing people from coming in."
"The one state that has the most electoral votes, the state that if you win, you're probably already winning Wisconsin."
"And based on what we are seeing right now, it is very possible that she is turning it around as well."
They're not going to vote for you.
"I mean, she's a criminal."
"But former President Trump has his own issues in Pennsylvania, the suburbs."
"So Harris, if she wins it, I really think she's got the presidency."
So CNN's reporter at the event did say there appeared to be some confusion about what was happening while he was up there on the stage.
"I'm from Kansas City, Kansas."
I know you're always on the Hill as well so you're probably thinking about these questions too.
"Okay, the point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired."
"No improvement in Texas, no improvement in Florida, no improvement in Ohio, no improvement in many of these other states."
"Harris may focus on energizing younger voters and minorities, who have historically leaned Democratic but may need additional motivation to turn out in significant numbers."
Those are areas where she could really draw separation with herself and Joe Biden.
"And to your point, Major, to focus and be strategic about where the message is going."
"So not only did I not find it swung them one way or another, but the gentleman we talked to in the middle, who was basically, I don't care."
So it's gonna get weirder before it gets more normal.
It's got to make people nervous about the future.
"Trump, a master of using personal narratives to energize his base, has continued to use this incident as a rallying cry, especially among the state's large, predominantly white working-class electorate."
"As we talked about on Friday, when we were doing scenarios, it all comes down to electoral math."
Don't just believe everything you hear.
"It's like 283 is the best I've gotten, which is pretty good."
"You know, I'm for the middle class."
You power our honest reporting.
"Recently, you were writing more about the history of the blue wall, how Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin have voted the same way in every presidential election since 1980, save one."
"But then again, we like to follow the book."
"And so I think given that we've seen a massive, massive shift relative to President Biden, we can also see this translated to a massive, massive shift on the national level as well."
"In my lifetime, the Republican party has changed with Donald Trump."
Is that a strategy they can rely on going forward?
"If we immobilize that group, we win."
"I mean, he is out there."
She does seem to be an outside figure.
Republicans did well.
"And that's extended not only to on immigration, but also he said twice over the weekend that there is an enemy from within."
So I'd ask people to go to bobkasey.com to help us.
President Biden visiting the state three times in a week and delivered a blistering speech against former President Trump last night.
"Well, I know there's a lot of as they quoted misinformation and disinformation, but there you can find sources and facts."
Your current industry is going out of business.
"Whoo, it's hot here."
One that is even.
"Thank you for your time, sir."
They've done things that nobody thought was even possible.
"We have to talk about the 2024 presidential election, because it appears that Kamala Harris is in deep trouble in the key swing state of Pennsylvania."
"Well, I'm going to take you back to 2020, Bob, and I'm going to show you this because these are places that Joe Biden won."
How's it looking now?
Makes sense.
"Just 50% of American adults lived in middle class middle income households down from 54% in 2001, 59% in 1981, and 61% in 1971."
And he was in the line of fire as he was protecting his daughter and his and his wife.
Northampton has an industrial draw.
"The Trump campaign told Spectrum News it has paid staffers and volunteer-powered field programs in every battleground state, including Pennsylvania, and they are expanding daily."
"Well, we've already, we welcomed the second gentleman a few weeks ago."
"You have a shirt here and it's Trump, and then you've put duct tape over another name."
"I've been waiting for her to laugh because as soon as she laughs, the election's over."
"But in large, Pennsylvania is one of the most important states of this election cycle and that cannot be understated."
Most radical left person ever to run for office.
"The governor's office reached a $295,000 settlement with the accuser."
"Pennsylvania, we do not need four more years of that."
"A new worry since our last visit in May, Trump running mate, JD Vance."
It can be misleading and maybe just maybe it's entirely possible that Pennsylvania polls actually understate Harris.
"This is the Suffolk University poll, which again, number one rated in all of the 2021, 2022 polling."
Watch and listen.
Are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead America?
"Very sad, but also it looks like we're coming to an end with this."
What are these candidates saying?
And I guess even their taste in music.
"This compares to a Quinnipiac poll of likely voters in Pennsylvania on August 14th, when Harris received 48 percent of support and Trump received 45 percent support."
"I wanted to at least report part of that to you and to encourage people who are doing this work, keep on doing it, keep on preaching it, keep on sharing it because hearts are going to be touched and inspired by the power of the word."
"The reality is, is probably neither of these candidates are going to do a lot to bring down the deficit."
"Now, I don't know what Mr. McCormick was talking about because senators don't sign legislation."
"But of course, she's a beautiful woman, so we'll leave it at that, right?"
The tenth poll was conducted between September 1 and 25 by active vote among 400 likely voters.
Nobody over 70.
"So in terms of that argument for 2022, but still I think it's important to take polling with a little bit of a grain of salt."
That's what I think about these days.
I think Oz is more of a grifter.
Alright in Pennsylvania.
I don't know why that is.
"Maybe they're persuadable Whereas most of the people who read mainstream Print media in particular, you know, they they already know politics really well They've made up their minds a long time ago So that she's decided to waste of time to to go to them because you've got all these other outlets And lastly, what advice you have for students ahead of this upcoming election?"
"This mobilization is crucial in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, as increased voter turnout among Trump supporters could be decisive in a closely contested election."
"And for his sake, hopefully it doesn't cost him."
And I think what she's doing so effectively is connecting the dots between his rhetoric and the real policies that he's put in place and that he will put in place.
"Trump flipped the state for the first time in 24 years, and then in 2020, Biden flipped it back, but just by around one percentage point."
It has to do with the basic image of each candidate.
Between that and January 6th this stuff disqualifies him from being president I just think that's bs personally.
I've noticed that state polling you know we seem to see a little bit of it trickle out every single day but in terms of seeing like the daily drops for state polling that we were seeing in some points in 2016 and 2020 or even national picture daily drops besides TIP there's really not much else out there.
Help people get involved and help people work to save America.
"It's OK, as long as our side wins."

Thanks for waking up with us.
"Now is the time for every American who loves our country to step back from the division, renounce all violence and unite in prayer for President Trump and his family."
It's amazing to see the support that we had for our small business.
"TENSILVANIA is not just any battleground, it's the state that could flip the outcome in either direction."
Half century.
"And when you talk about that white working class vote, Harris just dropping, you know, two, three points, you know, Trump making up some ground just because Joe Biden was a better fit for those voters than somebody like a Kamala Harris."
Go get Capacito y Guava Pasalito.
We keep it real and raw where the
There was a report that he had scheduling conflicts and didn't show up to the the the the tour all over Pennsylvania yesterday.
They believe now in a campaign that's that's floundering and will say anything.

And fight is what's going to get us to win in November.
Supporters of abortion rights have succeeded every time the issue has been on the ballot for voters to decide.
Trump's fixation on celebrities didn't stop there.
And I think that Trump's decision to pick Vance as his running mate signals that that's kind of where he wants the party to move.
But the good news is that Kamala Harris does not have concepts of a plan.
Democrats have done it all to themselves.
That's beautiful.
He's a Trump voter all the way.
"Joining me now, president of Decision Desk HQ, Drew McCoy, happy Monday to you."
It can't be allowed to happen.
"People couldn't believe it, right?"
"L.A. Williams, CNN legal analyst, former federal prosecutor."
"The fact is that, you know, they want to get away from gas."
I'll be honest with you.
Black people didn't do this.
It's not because of anything that the government is on private land.
"80,000 votes separated Joe Biden from Donald Trump in the 2020 election."
"If you guys did enjoy this video, smash the like button down below, subscribe, share with your friends, hit that little bell, follow the social media accounts in the description down below, and of course join the channel today."
"And these panels have had problems this time out, in my opinion."
The ability to achieve such victories can be used to build a narrative of strength and effectiveness.
So maybe we'll make a Maha skateboard.
"And clearly, in the case of Dr. Oz, I mean, that really kind of pushed Dr. Oz to the front, the front of the pack."
"So this is why the vice president Kamala Harris just says, let Trump's talk, speaking, do the arguments for them."
"Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who was a VP finalist himself, called Walz a great choice."
"There's a good chance that Republicans could be at 30% of the early vote, which that might actually be low because there's some people suggesting that it could be even worse for Democrats."
We're going to touch base on who that individual is.
So it used to be the case that social security was supposed to be enough to help you live without needing other forms of income.
"Okay, here we go."
They went to work every single day.
So let's go to that.
That's the laugh of a crazy person.

She's in the White House now.
"And these campaigns hunker in because that's the other thing the polling showed is that, you know, with on the issues, Trump is doing better on some of the key issues that Arizona voters care most about, such as his pocketbook issues and immigration."
And then he did an ode to rambling.
Oh yeah.
"Now, it's important to note that many people we talked to so that they're afraid to say who they are voting for because of the deep partisanship in the country right now."
They're expected to put a Republican there.
"Pivotal, pivotal to see you."
Oh my gosh.
"Now, why do a lot of these polls are wrong a lot is because they use the previous cycle's turnout to dictate what they're going to pull for this cycle."
He's a good man.
They're just totally forgetting about the latinx.
They just see families.
"Let's head over to Michigan now though, which is generally considered the bluest of the three core Rust Belt swing states, excluding Minnesota, as it does consistently vote to the left of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania at the presidential and down ballot level."
He could be his own man and he says what he's what is on his mind and he's been consistent through the decades.
"Yeah, no, the general always makes it more difficult."
I think there might be.
"No, the jobs that were lost during the pandemic got added back in the years after that's not job growth."
All eyes are on Kamala Harris as we wait for the first major decision of her presidential campaign.
"That's why it's a big deal that he's tied to the RCP average, which is a tie because screw Bloomberg for having this garbage Harris plus five."
"But just in general, with the note, no more crazy pandemic, we're not going to be dealing with that environment."
"They're going to vote by mail, vote early, whatever."
She's not going to do us any good.
"But for some reason, I think things are heating up and they don't like our poll numbers being out there."

We have to get the resources to the border to get the job done.

"You're winning Wisconsin, probably winning, Georgia, probably winning Arizona."
"That just makes it much more difficult, I think, for the president to shine a light on the stronger elements of the economy, which do exist."

"Called on election night, no consideration in these battleground states, Trump was in it to win it."
"So if you're a Republican, you want Trump to about age, but he's still talking about age because he can't get off his old talking points."
"That's incredibly close after almost six million some, or more than six million votes that were cast in the election."
"And I'm just for some reason, maybe call it me having a fucking empathy, a soul or something like that."
"I mean, this is about as close as it gets."
So we definitely don't want her in.
"Now as for the remaining states, the two candidates do hold a clear edge in most of them as you'll soon come to see, but though they are all very likely to be decided by single digit margins, and so should either candidate come to win this race in landslide fashion, they could theoretically flip either direction."
"Look, he says now, I think he forgot to do it."

And the Supreme Court.
"Now, if there is one part of this that is a little bit worrying for the Democrats, it's the city of Philadelphia itself."

That's a majority.
"I mean, it's just the facts, you know, so are you a Marine?"
"Harris continued her campaign blitz, focusing on black male voters, with an interview on the radio show, The Breakfast Club."

"Thank you, Meghan."
She wants to make it easier to afford stuff like a crib or a car seat or diapers.
"So I can understand, you know, maybe you want the right person to do that."
"You know, we don't think that Donald Trump is going to die tonight, but what we do think is that the behaviour of people towards politicians is unacceptable."
We've all seen so many times now.
Two generations definitely worth watching.
"Bucks County, Pennsylvania discovered bridge, a local treasure."
"Bob Casey's problem is that he is an incumbent at a time when Americans are very dissatisfied with the status quo, especially on the Democratic side."
"Industries like coal mining, steel production and agriculture remain important in the local economy and policies protecting local jobs from the impacts of globalization are core factors in attracting the support of this group."
I think if we really start to look at how we really have a lot more in common and we all really want the same goal.
"Both candidates, both Dave McCormick and Bob Casey, just slugging away at each other."
We've seen a tremendous movement in the polling since Kamala Harris took over though.
The Georgia and DC cases likely aren't happening before the election either.
But Trump is polling better in Pennsylvania than he is in Michigan.
You're deep in it.
"If she can tap into the concerns of suburban voters, she may significantly enhance her chances of securing a win in Pennsylvania."

Shaw says she voted for Trump in the past.
We're going to get that again.

"Yeah, I'm still 50-50 on the debate."
We need adults in the room who are actually going to be president and vice president.
They are surging.
"If you win Pennsylvania, you're in a really good situation, especially if you're Trump, if you're Harris."

Ukraine now has Russian territory.
"In 2020, Biden's focus on expanding health care access and addressing the opiate crisis helped him make some inroads with voters in the state, but Trump's strong support among working-class voters ultimately carried him to victory."
And you can see that.
But Kamala Harris has this problem in the state of Pennsylvania.
So I absolutely love Trump.
Now these counties here will report in earlier than Philadelphia because there are fewer people here than there are in Philadelphia and the thing to note is of all of these votes here in Allegheny in 2020 almost 65% of them went for Biden in this whole section here including Philadelphia it was about 66% of all the votes from this area went for Biden but in Philadelphia which is included in this number of the 66% but if you take this out and just look at Philadelphia 80% of the votes coming out of Philadelphia went to Biden and so when you look at 43% of all of the votes cast in Pennsylvania are coming from these two areas and that roughly 65% of all of those votes went to Biden it means that the state goes to the Democrat it's just the way that the numbers work out especially if there is a significant increase in the number of people voting in this area especially in Philadelphia and also over here in Allegheny which we expect to have happened in this election so come November when you're watching the election returns you are going to relax take a deep breath get out your popcorn and whatever adult beverages you might be consuming that night and you will just sit and watch the returns coming in from Pennsylvania and you will not care what is happening for the whole state of Pennsylvania until the Philadelphia metropolitan area starts reporting in and Allegheny County because between those two areas that is 40 it's going to be 43% of the vote and in fact I would say with the increase in voter participation for this particular election it could be anywhere from 45 46 48 percent of the entire vote coming out of those two areas and because the majority of the voters are voting for the Democrat this is why I predict Kamala Harris is taking Pennsylvania in this election it's just about the math
And make sure your voice is heard in this critical election.
We're seeing small dollar donations.
How big of a warning sign is this for Republicans right now?
"As we continue to analyze polling data and voter sentiment, it will be important to stay informed about the evolving political landscape and the implications for the future of our democracy.as we reflect on these polling insights."
This legal victory comes at a time when election integrity is a hotly debated topic.
"And yet Sherrod Brown in their own internal polling seems to be pulling ahead of their Republican candidate, Bernie Moreno."
So I can't explain it.
Harris's stance back then was loud and clear.
The scale of turnout in both urban and rural areas is positioned as a critical determinant of electoral success.
So these little margins matter.
Whereas the Trump campaign is really focused on increasing turnout in rural communities around the state.
"I didn't need saving, but he saved me."
"It has the Butler, Pennsylvania."
"So alienating local leaders in Philadelphia, it's not a good look for the Harris campaign."
"But we have right here for these two guys, and we see the Hill, Marist."
But they're showing Trump's in a strong position as well.
"My mother worked hard, raised me and my sister, and by the time I was in high school, she was able to afford our first time."
This is an outlier poll.
But Trump is not backing down.
"But basically, we'll know by two a.m. because a lot of those a lot of the swing states like the Rust Belt, their polls close, you know, Eastern Standard Time in Pennsylvania, Central Standard Time in Wisconsin, we should know by like 11 o'clock midnight with most of the counting."

"Nine in 10 Harris voters say, yeah, yeah, hurricane relief is going to people impacted by the hurricane."
"But kind of like Georgia and North Carolina, Harris' appeal as a candidate is most strongly suited to Virginia's demographic profile."
He bragged about it.
"Through the implementation of certain policy proposals that are of direct value to families belonging to the working class and the middle class, Democrats have taken on the burden of defending these objectives, according to his point of view."
"Dig, dive in."
"Pennsylvania, much like Michigan, has been a swing state in recent elections."
That's crazy.
"She's been in office this whole time with Biden, so she could have done something for this whole entire four years."
We get laughed at a lot for some of the shenanigans that our government does.
"So we're seeing that kind of political dynamic play out again here with this standoff, in a sense between the governor of Florida and the administration."
Isn't he fantastic?
And Scott Jennings said Trump does hold an advantage over Kamala Harris on the issue of the economy.
"And we don't use the least fortunate amongst us at punchlines for our jokes because they're our neighbors, our neighbors."
"In fact, it's a complete disaster for Harris because if the same point misaccurs and even then just half the polling miss, like, let's say fine."
That is even the bigger.
"After all these years, we know who Donald Trump is."
"When you stand for working people, you fight for working people."
"I mean, he's well known in Pennsylvania, which is one of those states that they wanna be able to carry."
People have accused the polly market of not being very accurate this time.
"So bringing her on board, that's a good sign."
Senator Casey.
There are people willing to do that.
"During the course of an interview that covered a wide variety of subjects, the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, provided a comprehensive analysis of the political dynamics that are taking place in his state."
Even when some of these other counties swing.
They should be in places like Georgia.
"It charged the entire political conversation in the country about whether relief should be sent to New Jersey, the scope of that relief."
The Democrats can and have generally do win Philadelphia by more than they lose the rest of the state by.
"So watch for, not just in those remarks at the podium, that the President will kick off and then the other remarks of the other speakers, but also watch from what you hear from folks down here on the floor about party unity, about how they feel they have coalesced, a lot of Democrats say, around Harris, obviously, hurtling towards November."
"Well, for starters, no, this lead that she has a quotations, it's because of one poll, one poll that found Harris up by five points."
"How are you going to make sure that they have the equipment they need to be safe, that they have everything they need to be able to live, you know, full and wonderful and safe lives."
"It certainly can, Kristin, and he is aligning himself with the top of the ticket with Kamala Harris here."
"And look at the difference, 44 percent of plurality, clear plurality."
I'd be considered a supporter and I'm worried in regards to what the polling is suggesting to put up around black men.
"And I think the vice president is absolutely correct to not only call out his rhetoric, but to remind us that rhetoric becomes policy if he becomes president."
Would you look at that Rasmussen?
We want Trump!
We'll talk about a little more a little later before we get to the polling numbers.
"But in the end, immigration, inflation, reproductive health care and the fate of American democracy, those are the issues that show up again, again, again at the top four of lists of voters in our surveys and everyone else's major."
"Well, it's not that they're fickle, because I think at 2016, Donald Trump really made his case to Erie more more and more successfully than Secretary Clinton may have done that."
But this was in July.
I survived the shooting.
Trump is taking Pennsylvania.
This is a group that are traditionally Democratic voters.
Any more questions from you guys?
"Now, yes, Hillary Clinton lost this area by over 4% in the 2016 elections, but in 2012, Barack Obama only lost it by like 1.1%."
"Right, every vote matters in Pennsylvania."
So he's already about to crack 50%.
You have to win everything.
"And then he said, I think six weeks, which is the state law in Florida, you need more time than six weeks."
Let's go do it.
But the registration data looks good.
We lost all these jobs.
I'm glad it is a female.
"Though Harris holds a decent lead, Trump's numbers still suggest that his campaign is maintaining a strong base, especially if turnout shifts toward more committed likely voters."
Wisconsin accounts for 10.
58% say disapprove.
Considering Maricopa County has now been defanged in its ability to fortify the election.
"So today we'll be looking at a 0.5 victory for Kamala Harris where it's currently at right now, despite a huge win for Donald Trump."
The message is please be patient.
Gives him a significant edge in a state that could very well decide the election.
"Now, I want to be clear that I am not saying there is no pathway for Trump if he loses Pennsylvania."
I pulled him out of school for that day.
"In many ways, that they're trying to get people to look forward at that."
"Essentially all Biden needs to do is keep the blue wall, which is Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and then if Trump can flip Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada, I mean, we can move into the unprecedented electoral tie."
Shots have been fired at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania.
D plus eight.
It is these metrics that show consistency and a lead for Kamala Harris and something that should terrify Republicans.
Do you think truly this can be staged by you because I see so many comments of people saying it is going the extra lens just to be able to get to vote from people and I think the part and the reason why people are saying that it is staged the most was because of the clip that has been going viral where it was telling the person trying to get him off of the stage to calm down so he can make the black feasts into the hair a black power feasts into the hair a lot of people are stitching that part and saying come on like if this is real and not staged it wouldn't have time to be doing all of that on that stage so let me hear what you guys think about all of this I am going to see you guys in the next one.
I think maybe she should be partaking in lithium because Donald Trump should be forced to live on an island with all these people.
"It was a lead that had been pretty substantial and had been maintained for quite some time, but was building up in the immediate aftermath of the first presidential debate that ultimately ended with Joe Biden dropping out of the presidential race."
Now contrast that with how our party has been moving.
"Somebody, one of the fake news back there, they corrected me one time."
All the counties around there are Trump Country.
You heard from other.
These are some of the things I hear most often.
What's past his prologue?
"It's, it's, you can't do it."
OK we have a problem with this demographic.
You know why she hasn't done an interview?
Harris did one today with a local Pennsylvania anchor.
So maybe there still is a chance that these states do get called at around two or three a.m.
"How about that, Ace?"
"That is huge in the state of Pennsylvania, which I think it's fair to say this election is going to come down to Pennsylvania, Michigan Harris is up 50 to 45 and Wisconsin Harris is up one point."
"I know this is going to seem sort of subtle to people, but this is a market change from where we were 10, 15 years ago when the best way to get a Democrat to stop talking about policies that would support people would be to pretend like there was some type of like deficit hockery and that they needed to justify these things, which was all just garbage."
Congressman Vance also said Trump's attorney general pick will be more important than his VP pick if he is elected here.
I'm sounding like Colin.
"So I mean, it, it's really going to come down to the wire."
"Yes, Simone, it's a major issue in the race for two reasons."
"These economic shifts have reshaped the priorities and concerns of the electorate, influencing their political leanings and candidate preferences."
It's fake news.
"Yeah, I know everything I Knew when the towers was from the fall the night before it fell I kept telling black toenails something to happen We finna die man."
But of course this cuts both ways.
Yeah a little bit There's a lot of black voters a lot of black people going for Trump.
It's not going to win talking about whether she's dumb.
"But as Mary Alice was just pointing out, the race is still really close."
Thanks for tuning in and stay informed as we continue to cover this historic election.
"So not completely worthless, but still good."
It can be misleading and I'm not denying that part of this is because of former Democrats that have been voting Republican for 30 years.
"So Casey's been kind of flat, as you can see in the graph in front of you, but McCormick has been gaining, which of course is cause for concern for Democrats."
He's totally discombobulated.
The series of explosive noises shuttered through this crowd.
"And if they're not even 60% of the early vote, they are in deep trouble."
I'm having a very hard time seeing how in 2016 and 2020 Pennsylvania was decided by two points or less.
How effective do you think this strategy will be and why does she still continue to struggle in gaining the support of young black voters?
It's for fun.
And Donald Trump at a rally just started making up stories about the Biden administration withholding aid from Republican areas and siphoning off aid to give to undocumented immigrants.
"Were you surprised that in a speech billed as being about the U.S. economy, Trump did veer off into so many other topics, even spending a lot of time talking about his former opponent, President Biden?"
"Yeah, that's a question we've had in Arizona and other states where ballot measures are on the same ballot as the presidential race."
"It was local I've been wanting to see Trump I voted for Trump the first time around and second time around And I want to see him in office this time around what in particular about Trump made you want to vote for him three times now Well, he his values align with my values if you can see my hat."
What do we know about how she's preparing?
What about vice president Harris?
Why people are looking to shake things up.
So that's why Pennsylvania is so crucial.
"OK, so you've heard this."
They say there's no reason to believe she can approach the numbers Biden was able to get.
"To basically flip this inflation, which what a year a couple years ago, they said that inflation was not going to be long term."

Where's the t-shirt for Sandy Hook?
He's already talked to Putin.
I feel very strongly that U.S. Steel needs to remain a U.S. company and that the people working there need to be American workers.

They had Biden winning the state by 6.3% this day in history.
But the people of North Carolina would like to leave it as Fort Bragg.
If we can use it use it.

The contrast in this election couldn't be more clear.
"He couldn't possibly have a decent proposal for healthcare, and he knows it, right?"
I was former president Obama wrapping up we're at times what we're at times passionate emotional remarks in Pittsburgh the first stop on his sprint through swing stage four Kamala Harris

She was a first-rate prosecutor.
"Plus, let's admit it, she's gotten a bit of a nice honeymoon from the press."
The Harris team is now saying that they want the microphones on all of the time because they think it makes Donald Trump look bad.
We're probably at peak possibility for surprises right now.
They want us to believe she's popular.
I think I think it's great.
"Guys, I heard that former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick is planning to write a book."
I'm pretty sure something bad.
"In 2020, they narrowly got by, and in some races, it really didn't work out the way that they thought it was going to be."
I wouldn't take anything for granted but I'm feeling optimistic.
Sabatini is also never Trump.
So I mean that should tell you everything you need to know.
"I think the most straightforward path for Joe Biden and for Kamala Harris is winning, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin Those are three states that have always been close, but traditionally voted Democratic You know Arizona looks tough for Democrats."
This energy and your black filling.

"But counting this idea to me, Manning burst out laughing."
So The sum total of all this is that when you add up all the demographics and all the votes It becomes almost like a toss-up.
But right now and the voter registration numbers are coming down.
I doubt that.
"Small stuff like 60 Minutes, but also non-traditional podcasts and radio shows."
He had a lot he wanted to get off his chest there.
Are we getting out our voter base?
"A lot of people, friends, a lot of people."

"But the bottom line is, is that Republicans, their turnout's up in the mail-in vote and the Democrats are down."
Did the Trump administration's policies help or hurt your family?
"As you know, Pennsylvanians very, very well."
"And I think one quote that kind of puts that on full display, I believe it was Jeff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia at the DNC, who said voting for Kamala Harris doesn't make you a Democrat."
Everything's supposed to be enforced there.
But you cannot deny that Biden ran it up in this part of the state.
It's about values.
I think it's at least useful for a barometer.
Donald Trump held a narrow lead over Joe Biden in these areas.
He should be condemning this.
There are reports of it.
Does he remind you of anybody that you serve with in the military or any leaders that you've known throughout your life?
"Now, you can never be 100 percent sure of anything, but the preparation for this is completely different than the preparation for July 13th."

"And that is Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania."
Where are they?
Trump and two others were also injured in the shooting.

"And those pair of rulings coming from Judge Robert McBurney over the last 24 to 48 hours where late yesterday, he blocked a ruling or blocked a new rule, I should say, that was implemented just a month ago by a controversial state election board that would have required ballots to be hand counted on election night."
"Yes, bec a hat."
Liberal historically.
"That state is, of course, crucial."
I did think I thought Kate Gallego was kind of a standout in those intros.
Pennsylvania has long been considered one of the most important swing states in presidential elections.
No one should go to jail for smoking weed which is hilarious because Kamala Harris prosecuted and put people in jail for smoking weed which is just wild and made jokes about it.

We have a flood of polls to look at for the critical swing state of Pennsylvania.
"Put up, okay, good."
We got boonies HQ.
"One reason this race is not just so tight but doesn't move very much is that each camp, Harris voters, Trump voters, not only disagree on what should be, but also have very different views on what is today."
"Well, that's because it's not then I'm pretty sure the end of the world will happen."
"Well, you scroll down here and look at that."
"Yeah, essentially if Biden loses Pennsylvania, the only way he could realistically even have a shot at the White House is he'd need to flip North Carolina."
Connecting with voters.
But Kamala Harris had a bump going into her convention.
"They follow the lead of the Secret Service, i.e."
Florida's diverse Hispanic electorate has long been a focal point for candidates.
And what else do you think he brings to the ticket?
"Well, look, I think that the message to them is like, is Donald Trump even talking about anything you care about?"
How would turnout differ?
Why aren't we looking at it?
"A lot of times if you're in a incumbent with a low of a favorable rating, that's bad, but it looks like they have an unfavorable rating of the other guy too, so we'll see, we'll see."
Were you aware of that?
It doesn't matter what happens in Wisconsin.
"And this campaign is also, you know, shifted slightly in favor of Harris, but still neck and neck race."
It sure did.
I go all over and follow Trump.
He has a lead in Arizona.
You're going to lose your pension.
Let's bring in CNN's Isaac Daubert for more on this.

"I'm sorry, the great John McCain."
Seems like jobs are doing pretty well.

But can she actually pull it off?
"You know, for many Americans across this country, when they see the images of video surfacing all over social media, to them it's just images of strangers."
 Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are each holding their first big events today since Tuesday night's fiery debate.
We want to turn now to Vice President Kamala Harris.
"Believe it or not, we are three weeks until the election and at this time three weeks from now, polls will have closed in the all important state of Pennsylvania for both candidates."
Is she coming?
"Because if even Josh Shapiro couldn't save her, she's in deep trouble."
Harris is more positive.
The reason they did that was because that's the purest form of propaganda.
They had JD Vance down in Ohio.
But just there's so many things you could look at and see the absolute insanity of these people.
He's very selfless.
A lot of the big issues for me were the fact that Kamala is a politician and the debate is a politician's game and I believe that she definitely has a better convincing point for who to vote for.
"The Trump campaign should throw everything at the state, not just invest some resources."
"I find it very unlikely that every pollster, including ones like Mollenburg and Fox News, the fact they have the race tied just like Rasmussen and Sussacwon, even inside her advantage, she had the race Trump plus two."
Casey's been in the Senate a long time since 2007 and McCormick made the most of that.

"All right, so then everybody's home ownership prices go up, $25,000."
The president's campaign says he'll give a speech on economic policy with a major focus on taxes.
Democrats who urged Biden to exit race say Harris is exceeding expectations.
Is it possible that she takes it maybe in reverse?
"How have the voters you've talked to reacted to because this is a part of Vice President Harris's economic message, how have they reacted more broadly to that message?"
This is Democrats fault because they took Biden out and that was the one place where he could have helped him was in Pennsylvania.
"You can always find any updates on our website, cbsphiladelphia.com."
They were trying to basically go away with the Secret Service and it's so odd that now they feel as though that the Secret Service didn't really step up to protect Trump in a way that they should have.
It's a right-wing conspiracy theory.
"She would destroy Trump in debate, highlight choice as an issue, energize our base and bring back young voters, give us a generational time change its time."
"And we've, we've been clear and said again today that U.S. energy companies must bring, must keep bringing pump prices down by closing this historic, historically large gap between wholesale and retail gas prices."

 Fantastic polls for Trump in Pennsylvania.
I don't want to mess.
It's for a lot of different people across the country.
He was incredible.
"Now, let's face it, though, the Secret Service performed marvelously once the shooting occurred and as well in taking out the shooter himself."
"And even their last poll that they did, it was basically a tired race."
I don't think there will be any guardrails.
"But it would probably be either more or less than that, depending on who wins the election."
"And so you know that I haven't thought that Trump had an age problem because I'm like, look, if you think the things he's saying is crazy, he's always been crazy, right?"
They don't want to see him dancing during his rally at all.
Marijuana and crypto and some loans that might go to you and maybe some other people too.

"Those are, that's data from local law enforcement around the country."
"And then this guy, this Ryan Routh or Ruth, however you pronounce it, this guy was all over Ukraine."

"And yes, it was."
That gets you pretty close to 270 right there.
"So if we're coming in high at tie, that means Trump's win."
"Pennsylvania is the second largest natural gas producer in the country, and Trump has attacked Harris relentlessly for her previous support of a fracking ban."
Watch this 14 million votes and they throw them out of office and you know what?
They were off by 12 and a 2020 they were off by roughly five points.
There will be a bloodbath If this and the outcome of this election is not to his liking we're gonna put a 100% tariff on every single car That comes across the line and you're not gonna be able to sell those guys if I get elected Now if I don't get elected it's gonna be a bloodbath stop with the continuous lying about this stuff Let's remember Charlottesville and what did the president then at the time say there were fine people on each side And you had people and I'm not talking about the neo-nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally But you had many people in that group other than neo-nazis and white nationalists Stop with the continuous lying about this stuff everything that she believed three years ago and four years ago is out the window But if she ever got elected she changed it.
"But it still would give you some kind of a boost, a small one, you know, maybe a one point bump, maybe."
"He clearly, it is getting to him that Kamala Harris has signed on to that no taxes on tips policy."
Make sure you follow me on X links.
But what we see in the numbers is there really hasn't been much of a change.
It's time for someone to put him in a bullseye.
"And for those that are saying, well, it's early, things could change."
"Which again, Biden did several points better in Allegheny, even Erie County in a place like Butler, Westmoreland, etc."
Do some of you remember that?
So that was the power of abortion at that time.
I'm Ben Mysalis from the Midas Touch Network.
"It's a weird scenario, but it's entirely possible."
First started serving in the United States military at 17.

"A month ago when you looked at the polls, New York Times plus four Harris plus three Quinnipiac for Harris, Franklin and Marshall plus three for Harris."

"These Trump flasks, the shot glass, this very patriotic water bottle, this Trump, oh, the American flag hat, made in China, this Trump military jacket, all made in China."
"When the Trump people and Trump allies look at these numbers in Pennsylvania, Matt, do you believe this could nudge them towards selecting someone as a running mate who appeals to a more traditional Republican, maybe not Liz Cheney per se, but someone a bit more in that realm of the GOP or did they just go more in the Trump direction?"

"So as they talk to voters, they have one eye on this."
"I mean, he just fits Trump."
"And by the way, I'm sorry, gentlemen."
She's given hardly any interviews thus far.
On the Republican side it's a little more negative.

Things change.
"She doesn't even live in the district, but that doesn't matter to them because they can flood the airways with millions and millions of dollars of lies on TV and on the Internet."
"And we begin this hour with both presidential campaigns, battleground bullets with just over three weeks until the election, starting in the all-important state of Pennsylvania."

I got to put in a pitch for my friend Tom Hagan.
"So in terms of that argument, there's so many left-leaning pollsters even that have horrible track records in past elections, but they get a pass from the election mafia."

"If you're looking at one state on election night, you watch Pennsylvania."
"Right now Trump's up by, you know, point two percent and that's with an outlier."
So we got to get our base out.

That's two right there.
You could tell that the basement strategy changed.
Fox News is going to do is going to release new polling soon.
"You got to vote for the first woman president, Harris."

Friendships are broken off because of it.
"I'd say the best for last, guys."
"I brought them into my ceremonial office at the White House to have a meeting about what their needs are and to make sure that they have the information about what's available to them in terms of financing capital and access to capital, support for what they want to do in terms of building or growing their business."

"They're already at 330,000 while Democrats they're still 200,000 votes shy from their total in 2022."

"Now it is Donald Trump who will be returning to the site of his assassination attempt to remember the first assassination bid, which took place on the former president of the United States."
I don't understand this outreach crap that they're doing.
"All right, so it seems we're at the point in time right now where every move by every candidate really reveals some strategy after the debate, where's Kamala Harris headed?"
I've heard bikers for Trump.
"Brack brownouts, blackouts."
"So if you are talking to friends and family and neighbors, and it's hard to have political conversations right now."
And it's interesting that President Biden now has been trying to tie the Republican Party writ large to what he terms the MAGA movement.

All of that needs to be seen.
"But again, it that."
"My plan includes making sure that for first time home buyers, they have a $25,000 down payment assistance to just get their foot in the door."
The ones everyone says they're Republican biased or they're a Republican pollster or some BS like that.
"And I know people are going to say, oh, well, he was a congressman."
Same thing in the Arizona case.
Nothing could be better for race relations than that.
She doesn't want the world to know.
Does that mean it's going to trend fifteen points Republican?
I believe so was Nevada as well.
Politicians will tell you anything you want to hear.
He will be a good running mate for her.
And Emerson's not the only one in recent days to find Trump either tied or slightly ahead in Pennsylvania.
"And now, eight years after he was elected, after all the arguments against Obamacare have been proven to be wrong, and even folks who don't like me sure like that insurance."
So Trump is doing five to seven points better than he was doing in Pennsylvania polling four years ago.
OK hit the campaign trail.
You do not either.
Meanwhile.
So the reports are currently saying that she's already amassed a legal team about 10 times the size.
"Again, Harris leads this poll by one point."
None of these other guys out here got these.
"Meanwhile, sources say Trump's preparation has included reviewing policy positions with advisers."
We used to be a country we used to have standards we used to have standards where candidates presidents will get shot and they get marked immediately bar.
"Truckers, they are busy serving us, the American people."
Americans want to move forward.

"In a close race, even a small percentage can swing things."

Governor Shapiro loves his job.
"While everyone else has the race tied or a small Trump lead, these garbage polls found Harris up by by some miracle three to five points."
"And now that Biden has a record to run against, Vachow is also hoping to win back some suburbanites who told him in 2020 they were turned off by Trump's personality."
But I don't think they're the problem in terms of election day.
"Because right now, even though she is still trying to reach undecided voters, that small sliver, Jeff, she very much is trying to close that enthusiasm gap that President Biden had with the key elements of her base."
And if black men weren't excited about that enough because Kamala Harris is going to be creating new opportunities.
This makes me sick.
"There was actually a strong focus from the Hillary Clinton campaign on Pennsylvania, and yet she lost the state by roughly the same margin that she lost Wisconsin by, even though she had not visited Wisconsin just once, not even once, after the convention in 2016."
Oh my lord.
"So they don't have a particularly strong track record in Pennsylvania, but it is true that their races for president tend to be a lot closer."
The world's full of amateurs.
What?
"Also address the idea that perhaps with a message nationally that has been very focused on abortion rights and those attendant to reproductive health care, maybe black men don't feel that their issues are things that are as important to them are being nearly sufficiently addressed."
"You can say, hey, I don't like that."
"This time, Congress will have the full weight of the federal government behind its security, including more officers on the ground and technology to detect potential material used in weapons of mass destruction."
And yet some of the people who claim that they want to preserve our democracy were mad that his plan didn't work.
"Does academic and activist Cornel West, who is running for president as an independent candidate, won't be on the ballot in Pennsylvania the Supreme Court decided Monday in upholding a lower court's ruling?"
I got a lot going on my ministry.
And Harris does count with the same level of support among this voting group as Biden did in 2020.
But I think this also applies to illegal aliens.
"Whichever of these two candidates wins Pennsylvania is very likely to be the next president in the United States, and they are going all in."
Blessing be watching?
We have team coverage tonight on this story.
Which is I mean just obviously completely the opposite of Trump's campaign.
You meet people where they are.
"The election would be entirely different if MSNBC reported just like CNN, which is an incredibly low bar because CNN is very fake news, as we all know."
The visit was more than just a stop on the campaign trail.
"Governor Josh Appiore, thank you for your time."
In this philly in pennsylvania and philly suburbs pittsburgh suburbs.
Listen to this word salad here.

"NBC News correspondent George Solis joins us now from Reading, Pennsylvania with more on this."
Delaware is right next door to Pennsylvania.
You can literally search the January 6th committee archive and see the depositions and testimony.
"Simply put, no."
He was up in trying to run last time.
This is something we've seen before in American politics.
"For Joel, Dan and Kevin, a return appears more elusive, signaling a potential realignment of the country's political parties for years to come."
Catch us up on the messaging today and the approach for Trump in these important suburban counties just north of Philly.
What do you think that's going to do for the economy?
We need these.
"And you know, there may be an event and Kamala Harris gets a bump and another assassination attempt, Donald Trump gets a bump."
"So I find it very interesting that the Biden campaign, they're launching this six figure ad by, you know, where they highlight Trump essentially slamming Haley over and over again."
"But Trump still pulled it off, you know, by winning those key swing states."
"But anyway, like and subscribe."
"Next, we have a poll from Muhlenberg College conducted between September 16th and 19th."
"Now begs the question, how much did polling error shift in eight years?"
"And let's just say hypothetically, Trump, or let's say hypothetically, Trump is able to win a state like Nevada."
And that's what President Trump did.
The answer could hinge on turnout.
"If you're Donald Trump, you start attacking another struggling, even smaller town."
What's your reaction to that in Donald Trump's statements in general saying that the Medal of Freedom is better than the Medal of Honor?
"I'm a conservative Christian and he aligns this, the party aligns much more with my ideals as a Christian as the Democratic party."
I woke up.
"I don't know, but you're in Pennsylvania, but you're actually running in Ohio."
"But his team does still believe that they have the momentum, which is part of the reason they've been very quiet over the last couple of weeks ever since that debate."
"But once it's done, I would like to give this to President Trump as well, just to give him a show of gratitude."
"Trump's campaign is also heavily focused on Pennsylvania, criticizing Harris on economic issues and trying to shape her image among voters."
Dave McCormick shouldn't be discounted.
"One thing is certain, this race is far from over."
Shots fired at the Trump rally.
I gave him lunch.
"So listen, this is crazy."
And they very rarely agree with each other.
"And Brian Fitzpatrick, it's notable, the Republican from Bucks County, won his primary against a conservative challenger."
She's a criminal.
It's just it's just some weird stuff.
Thanks for being with us.
But let me pull this up with that caveat from Quinnipiac October 3rd to 7th.
So they're going to come back and now have this bombshell in 2024.
So I have registered over 40 b and some of their family registered.
"I mean, my goodness, we can't believe a word this guy says."
Donald Trump has returned to the place where someone nearly took his life.
"But even if there's a one point miss, a two point miss, which is, by the way, much more accurate than 2020, which again, in 2020, in September of 2020, excuse me, it was Biden plus four."
Biden navigated to the center of the Democratic Party.
"Okay, Secret Service encircled Trump within seconds of the shots being fired and the agency statement is that the former president is safe."
Others wonder if Melania's absence is a reflection of deeper personal issues within the Trump family.
Now she's good paying jobs for black men which I think is different.
"See Biden there, he won by 17,000."
I think the woman would.
"After facing off earlier this week on a Philadelphia debate stage and standing together in New York for the September 11th anniversary, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are on opposite ends of the country today."
Ninety-four ballots in one tray.
Let's get it.
" Alright everyone, we start off today talking about Civil War brewing actually within the Democratic Party."
Now an analysts have put two firewalls in place.
Like The New York Times had like a D plus one electorate.
So we met with the crew.
Those are three major issues of these people they pull for the state of Conville to Pennsylvania.
Here's the abortion issue.
"If you don't get those references, just let it go."
"Now, I understand a tariff is any imported good."
Oh I think They They're not like really deliver what they we expect for them to deliver That's why we got a lot of stuff going on in the country So that's the one that's one of the reason why we are supporting campus last thing I wanted to ask you is what would be your biggest fear under Kamala Harris administration if she were to be elected?
"The former president appeared fixated on those who, in his mind, have wronged him, rather than addressing the concerns of American voters."
"If you look at the polls, you would have thought they would gain traction from November until now."
"Then of course in Wisconsin, they're effectively tied Harris 48, 47."
Usually presidential candidates have months to sort out their vp picks.
"Anyways, do we all realize how serious of a situation that was?"
You don't align with the political party at all during registration.
"You really have to hold up your margins everywhere, and that's what we're here to do."
"So that was more than some of the crowds that Harris had in recent weeks, or in recent days."
She's gonna be amazing as our president and our vice president.
"I've been covering this campaign for a while now, talking to supporters that moment, not only unified kind of the Republican Party base around the former president, but also for his supporters, endeared them further to him."
"Along this line, there's the kind of questioning that always accompanies dramatic events, where, well, how did this kid do this?"
This just goes to show how complex and global the implications of this election are.
But there's a catch.
That's what many people said on the Internet.
And we all worked hard.
So I don't know what your two what your the impressions are for either of you about the state of polling.
"Now, we were energy independent under Trump."
"One of the biggest issues driving voter behavior in Pennsylvania is the economy, particularly as it relates to the state's energy sector."
Both campaigns know it is an important voting bloc here in Reading.
"But this time around, it doesn't look like that if the polls are to be believed."
What is this bus?
Presidents are temporary Wu-Tangs forever.
Some of those states are going to be to the left of the average.
"Edward Isaac Dovery is reporting that North America's building trades union voted today to endorse Biden much earlier than usual and with plans to spend eight figures on mobilizing its 250,000 members in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, they credit President Biden's work with infrastructure."
"However, in the 2020 US presidential election, Joe Biden won the electoral votes in Pennsylvania with 1.17 percent more votes than Trump."
Did you hear that?
We know it's bogus.
"And I think what Nikki Haley is hitting on, which is so important, is swing voters will decide this election."
We got a lot of dancing for about 40 minutes last night.
"We'll see, but his lead actually expands when you look at it."
And this wasn't three months before the election.
Democrats have tried to make this a focal point of this entire election.
"So, you know, reading the tea leaves there, who else would be in Philadelphia with her except Shapiro?"
"I mean, he is out there, he's given two, two and a half hour speeches, just word salads."
And you're trying to exploit that?
"Republicans voted in support of passing this, and it was signed into law in 2019."
"But four years ago, Biden won by one point two."
And both Barry and Dan are joining us live from there with more on what the voters had to say.
Important role.
Some of them are being particularly hostile.
Stick around.
Now Harris's path to victory depends on her ability to turn out the Democratic voters of Philly.
We do not have a negative opinion of them at all.
"We're gonna look up in terms of, I wanna show you what I'm saying right here."
"By showcasing two leaders with distinct backgrounds and experiences, the party aims to build a broad coalition of support that can carry them to victory in 2024."
So picture this.
"That 80,000 number, I want everybody to write that on the chalkboard in your brain."
That's something I'm trying to do as well.
America is ready to turn the page.

"Yeah, it's not a secret we've been going through a lot as a country and Yeah, Biden always promised promise a lot of politicians always promised through the years, but All of us know the world knows Everybody's experienced it the best president the world's I've seen this country that has ever seen his name is President Trump Now you can tell that he nervous that's what I like seeing though It's it's so many people that it's all crazy."

All right.
Then Donald Trump takes the mic again.
The remaining four pollsters though range from a plus one to Trump to a plus two for Harris.
"It really I think further diminished At least print political journalism and we were writing about what was going on on TV all the time but that really that rose was really the beginning of the change and With the internet came the explosion of media sites that everybody could start to really Good silo themselves with sites that perhaps spoke to their own political preconceptions and so the old Gatekeepers which was New York Times Washington Post maybe Wall Street Journal somewhat the LA Times ABC NBC CBS those were the main gatekeepers Well, their impact started to really diminish and that fragmentation has accelerated ever since to where we are today What what Kamala Harris has done this week was a perfect example of what I'm talking about that the mainstream outlets They all want interviews whether you know, which basically it's like, you know, we're the professional journalists We know the most about issues."
"Here's Eric Doherty over on X, breaking Harris campaign, pulls back Milwaukee, Wisconsin advertising, and diverts it to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania amid concerns of lagging turnout."

"I think by the end of this, I'm going to win my race."
I must less than making fun of the song.
And feel reminiscent of what we saw with Obama back in 2012 with an expanded Democratic coalition.

Donald Trump then wants the crowd to know he is not cognitively impaired.
"There is something possibly going on there because this matched the trends, but turnout in other places in the district were low."
"Here's another thing I peeped, a lot of y'all are hopping on the same train talking about some God protected President Trump."
"I want to pull on a thought you just mentioned, because this has been something I've been thinking about a lot, too, is when you are echoing dictators, when you're trying to crush the media, when you are trying to silence people out there, make it harder to vote, that's not a sign of strength."
"Well Trump had a Pennsylvania rally yesterday and he held up the, not held up, but he had the girl that came out that prepared his big chart that he says saved his life and it was a rip roaring rally and he let come on, there is habit."
"Okay, so I gave you all the data right there."
"I appreciate all you guys jumping in, jumping on."
I make this point on my show all the time.
He was trailing Trump in many cases by wide margins on the economy.
"But you know, it is one of those statements."
Harris and her new vice presidential pick are scheduled to be in Phoenix on Friday.
"But first, CBS News political reporter, Aaron Navarro streams with us from Pittsburgh."
"Specifically, which demographic groups will show up in higher numbers on election day?"
That's a runaway Trump train.
This is manipulation.
"Right now we have 16 million jobs added, 16 million jobs added."
We all need to Din Din in our lives.
"He lost by 16, 17 points to Julie Fedorchak."
"But again, I don't know what's going on with the intel because Trump's endorsements for a while are really improving."
"No, Trump right now is the favorite."
So we're going to go to here and go all the way up.
"And President Trump is winning Pennsylvania right now in many of the battleground states because again, people in many of the battleground polls, rather, because people there realize their lives were better off under his leadership."
I need to pretend like Harris has got this sort of stuff.
"Well, look, I think the big first decision she had to make was to choose a running mate, choose a future governing partner in Governor Walz, which she did."
"No, I'm not justifying it."
"As the Democratic National Convention approaches, Harris's upcoming speech is anticipated to further boost her campaign, setting the stage for a crucial period leading up to the presidential debate and the start of early voting."
The Pennsylvania primary elections will be held on May 17th.
"In addition, the governor discussed the legislative achievements that Democrats had achieved over the course of the previous five years and contrasted them with what he referred to as Trump's broken promises."
"Correct Major, this is actually going to be the vice president's 10th visit to Pennsylvania since becoming the presidential nominee."
And you could argue that's the reason he won Pennsylvania.
Let me know what you think about what all of these people said in this stage and what is your first reaction within the headlines that it was shot at Israeli in Pennsylvania.
"Kamala Harris, like the rest of them on the left, cares only about controlling you, your life, your children's lives, your parents' lives, everyone who is not in her sphere."
He is currently winning Pennsylvania by a couple points.
"And I guess the answer is till it's not, right?"
"The speaker highlighted the importance of unity among Puerto Ricans, expressing support for Trump's agenda, which seeks to empower the community and foster growth."
Is he stupid?
"An unfavorable rating for Bob Casey is 38%, so that's that, I mean, in the 33% favorable rating for Bob Casey."
"Every legal scholar felt and felt for a long time for 53 years, they've been trying to do it."

Do you think that's the state of the race in your home state tonight?
But there's a long way to go.
"Well, just think about this in the 2020 election, six point eight million votes roughly in Pennsylvania."
Doesn't that feel nice?
That is the laugh of a crazy.
"For the entire duration of the presidency, with the exception of this honeymoon period, from January 2021 to July 2021, Kamala Harris has been disapproved of quite tremendously."
I am not going back.
That could be used to suggest that he is a member of the Democratic Party who is just so ardent in his support that he registered as a Republican to vote in the primaries.
"Listen, I'm voting for Trump."
"So here's, you know, so if you, so gas prices, we haven't, we've seen increase in the West and the Midwest in recent weeks because of specific refinery issues."
"Now I've hired Whoopi to work for me as a comedian before this stuff, and a long time ago."
This is where it's going to be won.
"But if we go down here, we could see Insider Advantage is one of the worst."
"Now, what has changed events-wise, just to put this in some context from then to now, this poll here where Harris was up five was taken just after that Harris-Trump debate in September."
That's less than 2022.
"The economy has been, once again, the most important topic or issue in this debate to Pennsylvania voters."
And how is Vice President Harris responding?
The battle for Pennsylvania is intensifying with each passing day.
"From there, he launched into more of his traditional talking points."
It was a neck and neck election.
"For starters, the big counties like Philly, Allegheny, Chester, you know, Democrat areas, they started returning ballots much earlier than the rest of the state."
People went to jail for smoking weed.
We have a great military.
"So it's not a surprise that they're voting in big numbers right now in Pennsylvania and other States, but really just kind of have to look at the polls and we can't predict for sure what the polls are gonna look like three weeks from now."
"And again, that's the best compliment we could get."
"It's just convenient, yeah."
And Malcolm Kenyatta knows exactly what I'm talking about.
"She's statistically tied with Donald Trump and a bunch of battleground states in recent polls, including in Pennsylvania."
I'm invincible.
"Yeah, those are Pennsylvania Senate candidates, John Federman and Dr. Mehmet Oz."
"And you know, everybody's entitled to their own choice."
"I think there's no question that Tim Walz is going to come to counties like this across the country, certainly in all those swing states."
"We are a nation of laws, and we are a nation of immigrants."
"But Trafalgar is bringing the numbers down with the plus two, obviously Trafalgar being sort of an obvious Republican pollster."
"Now this was three years ago, so he was only 12 at the time."

"Right here, President Biden has surpassed the number of votes that President Obama received in the 2012 Pennsylvania primary."
"I got a text message from another brother in one of our local churches in a PA conference who an elder who texts me and say, you need to call so and so because they're going to be at the rally."
"You actually have to prove that it's false, but it's not false."
"But again, if Pennsylvania stays blue for Harris with 19 electoral votes, she has other options."
So Trump was losing in Ohio and in Florida that night.
"And everybody knows that, and we'll see how it unfolds on that debate stage tomorrow night."
Guy the red rub was talking about how you know white people are so quiet at this point because it was a white person who shot at him.
So we went and something amazing happened as we got closer to the rally to meet the group.
You might need somebody to finance this work.
The rest of the week is not yet known.
"Bottom line, where do things go from here for both the prosecution and those who are defending the suspects here?"
Please.
"Clinton 2016, Biden 2020, a never Trumper, she thought, but inflation and immigration soured her on Biden."
So I had to come to Butler.
"The state court Friday halts an enforcement of a requirement that voters include accurate handwritten dates on envelopes used to submit mail-in ballots, a ruling likely to keep several thousand Pennsylvania votes from being thrown out in the November election."
"And Nikki Haley has received more than 100,000 votes in the Republican primary in Pennsylvania."
"And very importantly, he's supported by somebody known as me."
That is bull crap.
"And to be completely honest with you, it's very frustrating."
How do they keep Pennsylvania voters engaged all the way up to Election Day?
There he is.
"""'Voters are able to see through his empty promises,' Shapiro said."
"Every once in a while, one will blow up."
"Again, this story going back says Kamala Harris hires a massive legal team to fight back against election denials."
"Pennsylvania's strong labor union presence, particularly in the manufacturing sector, has historically leaned democratic."
"But when she was running for president back in 2019, she agreed that a total fracking ban was necessary."
"I mean, Time magazine, think of this Time magazine."
"They're the kind of Republicans Harris hopes will cross party lines, in some cases, for the very first time."
I know the mayor and he supported me through events.
So good for walls.
"But in our numbers, like I said, this is now the fourth week in a row that the race has been locked in at Trump plus two."
"So you're speaking to a big pro-democracy audience here, liberals, progressives, independents and mainstream Republicans who reject mass."
I'm Doug in exile.
I don't believe her I Don't believe her because you can't change your mind just because you want to be the president fracking is an issue Whether it's Pennsylvania or anyplace else in the country.
"Uh, I think it's a Specified case where it should be in use."
"And the thing about that is, you know, these voters are going to get older."
Thank you for tuning in.
"In both of those last two races, the state was won by those candidates by only a few tens of thousands of votes."
Harris's decision is expected soon and CBS News reports she met with three finalists in Washington D. C. On sunday Arizona Senator Mark Kelly Minnesota Governor Tim Walls and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.
But now it's been trending Trump.
A rally in the same fairgrounds where there was an assassination attempt in July.
The heightened security measures underscored the volatile political climate and the very real concerns surrounding Trump's safety.
"We'll see what happens when it comes to that, possibly Democrats threatening a government shutdown."
If the rap on her as I read is correct.
This came out yesterday.
"And isn't it, I don't know what the right word is, but like the two guys that shot at Trump was what?"
"Very deeply disappointing and offensive to everyone who knows better and every woman, I feel like in the country, regardless of what they voted for in the last election."
"And by the way, that wasn't even the most surprising thing that came out of old Gasolini today."
"And one of the biggest hustlers out here is Reggie Jones from Charlotte, North Carolina."
How do you then expand that messaging in order to attract more of those independent voters?
Dan.
"He's brain damaged, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
It's just trash for your pleasure.
He has failed the test as commander in chief before.
"However, this is not the only news we have coming out of Pennsylvania."
"It's going to be the state that if Trump wins it, he's probably going to win the presidency."
"So representative Ronnie Jackson of Texas said that his nephew was injured during the shooting, former president Donald Trump at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania."

"It's time to honor the work that was done by our ancestors over the last 248 years to expand and protect our freedoms, not rip them away and to stand up for decency and honor."
People were dying.
"We are living in a time where evil is literally called good, and good is evil."
"And what say you, what's your take on these moderates in Pennsylvania who are never Trumpers or pro-Kamala kind of in the middle, whatever your thoughts are."
So Donald Trump has finally made an endorsement in Pennsylvania for the Senate race and he has endorsed none other than Dr. Oz.
Maybe the gag order in the case will be helpful to Trump if he's not able to talk about those issues.
"Like I heard David McCormick over the weekend saying that Democrats, they're they're coming for your stakes."
And here's what I'll say.
"Because if Kamala can't win Pennsylvania, she's not winning."
"But at the end of the day, I do think that somebody wanted wanted him dead higher up than what we think, because it was too easy for that man to get on that roof."
"This is a liability from the top of the ticket, down-ballot, in blue states and in red states."
It's not one of the giveaways that Kamala Harris is promising or for that matter some of the pandering that Donald Trump has done.
"However, the real contest is in the battleground states where Harris and Trump are in a tight contest."
You see all the Trump signs.
"Now, if you take Fayette County, which I mentioned earlier, talking in comparison to Philadelphia County, you actually have a 10% decrease in the amount of voters voting there, yet the numbers have gone up 13% for Donald Trump during this time."
"And then on election night, you'd be counting the ballots as they're coming in."
"The poll surveyed 950 likely voters, a solid sample size for gauging public opinion, and it found that President Trump and Vice President Harris are in a dead heat, each receiving 50 percent of the Vote.Michigan status as a swing state is no surprise."

"Oh, my God, dude."
You always hear people feel like the economy is going in a wrong direction and they don't feel great about the economy and poll after poll.
"All right, Anthony, I've been so curious about what this new polling is finding in Arizona."
"I don't wish death on anybody at all, right?"
I call bullshit.
"And so if you contrast that to what Donald Trump has opened up in PA, where I think it was just less than where you can count on one hand, where is all the money going in the Trump campaign?"
"Fight, motherfucker."
Why would you do that?
It's killed cylinder.
Right now D plus five.
"We're all going to rally together behind her to support her because there's power in the black vote, power in the black community in America, he said, it drives the economy, it drives culture, and it should drive the election."
This is this is no ordinary election.
"Look, polling will bounce around, but we're in a very close race now."
So what this is possibly saying is we're seeing Kamala Harris polls getting more skewed up.
Democrats can't afford to lose any ground with that demographic.
"However, we're done for, guys."
And that's with a Democrat pollster and PPP.
So especially with the one that has the flag on it.
39% are college graduate or professional with another 30% some college.
"But yeah, both sides are really just coming in hot with the personal attacks and policy seems to be a distant second here."
"Well, I'm just going to go back to an interview I just did on America decides with James Carville, a very experienced and very knowledgeable democratic strategist."
"Thank you, man."
Kamala Harris maintains this lead in a way that we haven't seen for Joe Biden at all this entire election cycle.
"So it really is a true battleground, a true toss-up here."
"You know, I like that."
And Alina Habba was the person who spoke before Donald Trump.
"She has about a 13 percent advantage with women, but she's down 5 percent with men."
Real great.
"So even then, he doesn't even need a state like Nevada, Arizona."
Donald Trump made a strong closing statement by saying why didn't they do all the things that she's proposing during the three and a half years that they've been in office and Biden did this entire moderate stance back in 2020 and she's trying to do it again 2024 but she didn't talk about her policy changes between 2020 and 2024.
But here is Harris with a decidedly different rhetorical approach to this age old question that we get from the Beltway Press.
Harris campaign is trying to address that as well.
"If Harris can effectively mobilize these groups, coupled with sustained enthusiasm from her core base, she could create a formidable coalition that significantly enhances her electoral prospects."
"The question a bit and ask you what people you live with, people who vote for you, your friends, people you grow up with, what do they see in Donald Trump that makes them want to vote for him?"
"And now they have it, Harris plus four."
That is awful and other states.
"Donald Trump is at 50% in the battleground states, Harris is at 48%."
"I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and something that's very important for us is every, the lives of the unborn and protecting the lives of the unborn because they're innocent."
"And he's, as you heard there from my answer, that was his reaction when Roe was overturned, saying it would made him very, very happy."
"If it's a consistent trend like it's been, that's a big deal."
I'm truly one of the strangest rallies ever.
I have faith they will.
"That's not really a good sign for Democrats, regardless of the spin that we will see."
"She is definitely, she's had four years to do it."
He said being diverted to those not in the country legally.
Susquehanna was one of the most accurate pollsters in Pennsylvania in 2020.
"So 48, 14, 18, 22, 26 minus three is 23, 1234567."
It's the perfect match because he can even get the votes in Pennsylvania.
You say very pivotal.
Republican voters who are concerned about election integrity are likely to view this victory as a sign that their concerns are being addressed.
And I'm happy to see them come out and support us.
So we're just eight days away from the first presidential debate between Harris and Trump.
They've been called fickle because they're not a reliable age group to actually show up to the polls.
Their support for Harris could help her make inroads in a state where every vote matters.
Vance did in Ohio this past Tuesday.
How do you respond to that?
"I'm going to tell you, this is the first time I've seen a Trump sign being a flag being flown on the back of a buggy from the horse and buggy from the Amish country."
So we have a equal opportunity in this America in this country So that's a good thing for us.
This is the average.
So it shows kind of that target group in a state that is completely up for grabs.
Let's think about this.
"Millie, I lost respect for Millie."
This could lead to further debates and discussions about the balance between ensuring election integrity and making voting accessible to all eligible voters.
What happened?
Let me know if you've seen that on social media.
" In the basement of this unassuming building in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, you'll find what's known as the underground."
There will be no one to stop this worst instance.
We've got kids who are able to turn the tap on and not drink water with lead in it because of the Biden-Harris administration and their commitments to us.
"Republicans in Pennsylvania are dramatically overstayed or understated, I should say."
"No, but Chester County is a good example."
They're taking a lawn sign.
I just saw this.
Many of the state's most well connected Democrats have been worried about the operation for months.
"I don't think we have to worry about him, do we?"
"Vice President Harris has focused her campaign today on Pennsylvania, which is not much of a surprise, but her strategy is worth looking at."
Let's talk about it all once again.
And it helped Vance in Ohio.
"He has a track record that is unlike a VP pick we have seen in a very, very, very long time."
"We first met the duo, both of Dominican descent, before former President Trump survived an assassination attempt and picked JD Vance as his running mate."
"They interviewed 45% were Democrats, 44% were Republicans, and only 9% were independents, that's very interesting to me, all right?"
Um hate is a strong word.
"Jake, thanks very much."
Why is she honing in on this particular area of the state?
And the moderate Republicans are going to be the deciders.
"So now, you know, you have this race that has just settled into like it's it's dead even not only nationally, but in these battleground states."
It's a challenge.
"Akayla, good morning."
So as you guys know in the debate There was a surprise name drop and that was actually of Polish people Polish Americans got a pretty surprise name drop They're not really mentioned for much Outside of I think like the sausage or something like that But they don't really get much mention and it's not a voter group that's really talked about very often but they got this big name drop and Kamala Harris is trying to sort of inject that because Polish people really don't like Poland and Polish people really really hate to Russia that puts them in a lot of Weird scenarios because a lot of times like Poland and stuff.
"And, uh, since we're, you know, the most iconic photo ever of a president had to do the fight, I got that on everything flags, yard signs, shirts."
"Back in 2020, her favorability rating numbers were not good after that 2019 and 2020 presidential bid."
So I think that a lot of people are reading into this type of stuff way too much and that's the way it is.
"And since in the past, you know, six, seven weeks, we've seen Harris put out different policies on tax increases for the wealthy as well as taxes for families, tax cuts for families, you know, she said in a speech this week that she wants to cap childcare costs at 7% household income."
The choices were Joe Biden and Donald Trump at that time.
"And their basic argument is, look at the guy who actually is there, not the guy that you have nostalgia for for the pre-COVID economy."
And the inspirational quote on the back.
"Akayla, thank you again."
Thing I cooperated with the very unfriendly and hostile feds.
And just wondering if this raises any other concerns about election security.
We are here to send a clear message.
"And in this period, Hillary Clinton was up like 10 points, eight points, a ridiculous amount in the polling in Pennsylvania."
But they're into the cooking.
Donald Trump sees that as an enemy.
We have updated numbers and apparently Democrats are not even at 66% in returns now.
"For example, she's also unveiling policies that providing a million loans for black entrepreneurs, national health initiative that is intended to focus on diseases that particularly impact black people."
"Because her background, I don't trust her."
PC is extremely future proof and you can download and install all the games you want.
Beautiful.
Not my pet.
What were your thoughts?
"You know, the crazy thing about this whole ordeal is that I was in some different spaces with Republicans, like just listening to like their thoughts on this whole thing."
It'll probably stretch way back.
Bush.
"If you like red meat, they're going to take your red meat."
He's a malign narcissist and he's a pathological liar.
He's paying attention to Bucks County as well in those collar counties of Philadelphia.
"Obviously, Republicans won't talk about this on the record."
11.

Because that is still the perception some people have.
"The in the the evidence for the for that is is is all over the you know, all over the the campaigns."

Let's play this for you.
And I believe it too.
"So you do have this dynamic that as a county is growing in most parts, not all counties, but most counties, as it's growing, they're more likely to become democratic."

"What's going on in this election, and this is after the conviction, Donald Trump seeing a bump in the state of Pennsylvania in a pollster that is not friendly for him, and it's not friendly for Republicans, and it makes sense."
Trump's record is a disaster.
Very accurate in 2020.
They have a love for the truth.
It's over for Trump.
"Now, the papers do, and you just write on a sheet of paper, concept of a plan."
He's here so much.

"And so, and so, but then they want to say, Oh, nothing happened in the 2020 election."
"But what I know is it's a call for violence, plain and simple."

Do it or else you're in trouble.
"But if you compare that to 2020 look at Rasmussen's final poll in the state of Pennsylvania, they had Biden leading by three points."
"This is the safest, most secure place in America right now."

"And as long as, you know, you take care of us, you, this guy, you know, his kids take care of the future generations, then this is what is going to help to create the economy, better jobs, open up everything else, you know, and that's, that's really, that's all I have to say about it."
I know we joke a lot about the size of Trump's crowds and his hands and his everything.
I hope they see jackpot and I hope they're entertained.
This is about where the race is in Pennsylvania.
"Fry station, pizza."
Just because how close it is?
She touched on a fe abortion a little bit on about uplifting Native Am That's something that Ste governor of the Gila Riv spoken support of and thr behind Harris.
Check it out.
"Now, just take a look, for example, in a rural district, Pennsylvania's House District, 139."
Something was wrong here.
And McCormick tried to attach Casey to Biden.
Name that name that sound.
"We know which side they're on, but there's this kind of reputation that a Rasmussen is going to wildly overestimate Donald Trump in the swing states."
You'll see both candidates in split screen and you'll see what those comparisons are.

It's things like crime.
Let's keep on going.
So this is a county that both campaigns are fighting to win.
And Gallup even had Democrats up by three points back then.
"Trump's rhetoric, the former president's comments that he's making, especially it's something that I really drilled down with McCormick about."
People lost everything.
Republicans should 100% go there because it exposes the fact that the Democrats do not want any election integrity and it's all gaslighting.

What did Trump say?
"She plans to meet with Trump on Monday during a visit to western Pennsylvania, where she said she will be happy to share with him to please, please come to Charleroi so we can show you these wonderful people because it's a different story everywhere."
Even fake news CNN fact checked her on that.

President Biden has stood up and talked about the magma Republicans and the just disdain that he has for the voter.
"So it's I mean, it's work, you know, three weeks out."
"Those people are more dangerous, the enemy from within, than Russia and China."
The waves would be crashing into my face.
Forecasts currently have Republicans with a slight edge in the electoral map.
"They grew up during Barack Obama's presidency, she said, they're excited for Kamala, but it's a different type of rationalization about why they're excited for her."
"So I want to start off with a little bit of breaking news here, and that is that Donald Trump, who frames himself as the leader of the party of the military, he was just rebuked by the army, an almost unprecedented rebuke here by the US army, after an altercation broke out at Arlington because he was trying to use his visit there as a photo op and there was some shoving that ensued."
We're going to.
"No, I don't have money for emergencies."

 All of you all welcome back to yet another political episode.
"My God, that's easy."

The fact is that she said that crap about the Knights of Columbus is unbelievable.
"So, I mean, yeah, I do."
"They would say, oh, there's going to be a bump."
Do you think that it's time for her to sit down for an interview and explain that decision to change course on some of these issues and take some tough questions from members of the media?
You sent some fighters to D.C.
Many guys think it's being drained by their aging bad genetics or maybe even a lack of exercise.
So what will President Trump be doing during the DNC?
His messaging may focus on tax policies and regulatory changes that aim to boost job growth and economic stability in these sectors.
And I think that's the best definition of freedom.
"Thank you, gentlemen."
Here's some of the photos.
Is that who you're trying to educate?
Maybe he doesn't understand.

They never did.
"So I guess everybody's in the state, both of you guys."

"She was actually at 1.6 on the 12th, which is damn near a month ago at this point."
"No, I mean, no, it doesn't bother me."
"The leadership refused to endorse Kamala Harris, which is a stunning defeat for her, by the way."
And he had a career of doing that.
So now you're in it.
I'm sure there are.
I'm hearing that things don't change that drastically.
"This is Biden putting on, uh, the hat here, uh, putting on a truck."
"There's no relevance to whether or not the ballot was received on time, said Mike Lee, the group's executive director and email statement."
So what's the takeaway here?
"I have already provided them many times, including quite recently, and they were flawless."
He was up with the white vote by only one.
One hundred percent.
Free enterprise.
They would not say that.
"Certainly leaving the door open on many different directions here, Jesse."
"Aaron, thank you so much for that."
This crowd is 90% gone from the seating area.
Transitor.
How is Harris getting ready for this?
"So the classic talking points, he connects with his people, he's got energy, he's mentally all there, but do you think it's working?"
"While there are many reasons to vote for Kamala Harris, the most significant may be that she has a strong candidate."
But that is something that is still hard for voters to swallow.
Nevada counts at a snail's pace.
"You know, now that fracking has worked as well as it has, there was a point in time, at least when Trump was president, that we were energy independent."
"Jenny, thanks so much for being here with us today."
"I really believe that she should hold tight and true to the strong part of the Democrats message, which is that we have we have a border bill that we presented to this president who Johnson and he vetoed."
I am here to tell you that is not what real strength is.
Where?
You have used words like animal and rabbit to describe black district attorneys.
"Put that aside for a moment for all their criticisms of Federman, which include just making fun of the guy for a medical problem that he had."
But did you know that 99.5% of them are small businesses?
They make in front of him dancing.
Vance has been on TV constantly and he does a lot of press conferences as well.
Harris will return to the Keystone state tomorrow for a campaign event in Philadelphia.
"And let me tell you, after Tim Walz admitted to lying on national television about his stolen valor the other night during the vice presidential debate, veterans do not take kindly to stolen valor."
I need to see why it wasn't there that day.
"A red county right next door, by the way, to Lackawanna County."
"And Pennsylvania was ultimately decided by a very narrow 80,000 votes with the mail-in ballots and everything else that was going on."
"It is Harris plus 8, and it was surveyed between August 14th and 17th."
"I think more than anything else, if he's elected this time, there it's going to be staffed with loyalists from the start."
He handpicked three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade.
Tim Walz will be ready on day one.
You take that income out.
No question about it.
Trump can argue that Democrats' opposition to these requirements is an attempt to undermine the security of the electoral process.
"Buckle up, because this is going to be a wild ride."
I want that to continue.
The Harris campaign will certainly be trying to turn out votes in Milwaukee and Dane County around Madison.
"Well, that's right, the former president was in Central Wisconsin courting voters at an airport hangar rally."
That's a place where trading out Biden for Harris was probably a downgrade for them.
So says Kamala Harris will legalize recreational marijuana breaking down unjust barriers that hold black men and other Americans back and making sure black Americans have opportunities to succeed as the marketplace takes shape.
I also believe that any small business needs to think out of the box.
"As far as the economy goes, I think that's another thing that is going to be important for our generation of voters."
"She emphasized the importance of listening to voters and earning every vote, particularly in areas that are not traditionally Democratic strongholds."

"And if you win both of them, you won."
"Right, that he's just like us feeling."
"It's like Trump plus two in Wisconsin, Trump plus three in Pennsylvania, which I'm not saying it's a guarantee."
It was it was nine million barrels a day under Trump.
I couldn't tell.
And that is that this election is really about the future.
"Has your, has your beautiful town changed?"
"And as I said, these are the last breaths of his dying political career."
She is the Vice President.
"While Harris, if she gets Pennsylvania, that hurts Trump quite a bit because now he has to win a state like Arizona and Wisconsin, just to barely crack 272."
Why do I emphasize that?
Is that your strategy here just to have them out and everywhere?
Trump says social security should not be taxed.
"So, of course, Trump and Musk, the team will go get back and they will be together to support this campaign and to extend the cause."
"Kay's career spanned 23 years at the Daily News, where he became known for his outspoken criticism of Los Angeles City Hall and his passionate coverage of major issues like police violence."
New York Times had Kamala Harris up four points.
I've been laughing as Bob Woodward is a man of a certain generation.
Like a civil war to me involves black people.
So there's actually some there's some interesting breakdown within those undecided voters.
He's OK.
"All right All the way up the hill there check that out All these people y'all look at that But then you have people at a Kamala's all Talk about Kamala's rallies Trump don't have nobody yet, man."
The former president has been moved off-site.
How do you think that's going to play into this election?
I have to sort of my career arc was that I Was a what is awesome called a straight reporter?
She's up 0.6% of the five way.
"I mean for someone to speak their mind and you don't really see that so much in a politician these days, you know, they're like, okay, they should all be having like the logos on them like race car drivers, you know, all the politicians."
Question of course is it's going to be enough on the balance.
Nice to meet you.
And Kamala is not the answer.
Our generation turned out in record numbers for President Biden.
Much bleeding took place.
"I'm curious, so both were recently in Pennsylvania."
Two thirds of people have skin irritation and then over two billion plastic razors enter our landfills in the United States alone.
"I think to Daniel's point earlier, people they're excited."
I'll write out a little piece of paper.
"One of the most important is the economy, particularly the state's manufacturing sector."
I really don't think a plurality of people say abortion at all in any other group.
The Democrats big pitch has been nowadays about women's rights so-called women's rights and abortion access What do you make of that pitch to woman?
It is narrow.
He's been impeached twice.
"He said, well, we've got to look at everything."
"When asked for comment, the Trump campaign did not address Loomer simply saying his participation in the 9-11 ceremony was not about anyone other than the souls who are no longer with us."
"Well, the polling in the swing states really is what's important."
Has that changed in 2024?
A huge loss.
Now.
"You have the Democratic candidate, John Federman."
"Not even a bullet will stop us, said Valerie Mansberger of Newville."
And the name calling and the nastiness does not help Donald Trump.
"But when you look at the county by county data, you have places like Chester County, Pennsylvania, not a ancestral Democrat area."
I want him to finish here.
She's all in now.
"Or do you think that he should have endorsed one of the lesser known candidates, whether it would be Gale or Barnett or whoever?"
We're a nation in distress.
"In January of 21, just after Biden revoked the Keystone Pipeline, one of our fuel receipts totaled $592 for 200 gallons of fuel."
"Well, Major, great to be with you."
Whoever Harris does select as her number two could have an impact on this race.
"Only she just goes, was I, I was against fracking?"
I tell these people to be quiet.
"And he became president of the United States, which is not something even he imagined would ever happen, but he's got this power."
Let's get a photo.
"Now, it's true that with these white college graduate voters, Harris may make some gains by how much we could, you know, question that."
There's some wiggle room in there.
She's fighting for their freedom too.
"Kamala Harris has borrowed Trump's homework a couple of times, but otherwise, she has, at this point, and this is inexplicable, even for the Kamala Harris campaign."
He's at 49% to 45% for Harris among independents.
Do people really believe that Kamala Harris of.
"Well, my goodness, we don't have money left for our own citizens because of how it was wasted."
We encourage you to explore these sources for a comprehensive perspective.
Successfully appealing to a broad coalition will be vital for her electoral strategy.
He has no hope of winning instead of the states.

Trafalgar had Trump up two.
"Tim, my man."
"And it looks like again, a 50-50 some game."
"They said, all gloves are off."
"He came from a purple district, a Trump district."
Bibles and a sea shoes.
Give me a medium.
"Because what I have to say is going to make so much sense that even if I'm coughing a little bit, I think you're still going to catch what I'm saying here."
They see Donald Trump brag about Vladimir Putin.
State parties didn't give us enough support.
And the economy is very important in Pennsylvania.
Do your job.
So I don't really question Quinnipiac support for Harris in this.
"And Trump immediately acknowledged that when he came on the stage Wednesday evening and how he took a jab right at Kamala Harris, you know, as to be expected."
"So on the roadway leading to the rally site, it's now blocked off and members of the media."
It's extremely serious.
You can't let people set the state.
Pick one.
I'm an all of the above energy governor.
"And if you don't like the current administration, well, she's made all the decisions too."
I approve my governor.
What you're seeing here is that 8.2 percent more people have an unfair 8.2 percent delta between the unfavorable and favorable numbers for Donald Trump.
It's OK with me.
"I want Pennsylvania to continue to get its fair share from the federal government, to have a president that I can call and lean on when times are tough, when like we did when I-95 collapsed, we had a president who we could call who would be there for us."
They gathered a group of Latinos to talk about those issues.
"So simply let's simply put, if you hear that 25,000 is going to be discounted from the house as a homeowner, what would you do as a homeowner?"
 All you hear is that the Democrats are the ones with the amazing ground game and the Republicans less so.
But there's various reasons for that.
That's why I believe he was able to win Pennsylvania.
So to me it's just really hard because it's what they really do when they're elected.
The debate is scheduled for September on ABC News.
100%.
"In percentage of the lowest income earners, those earning less than two thirds of the median income had grown four percentage points from 25% to 29% of the population over that same period though."
"These three states have often shifted between Democratic and Republican control, making them incredibly valuable to both parties."
And the politicians are following.
I would love your food.
It's because Mike Pence has come out as the rhino that he's always been and said that those of us that vote for Trump are toxic.
And we've seen that rhetoric heightened over the past couple of weeks and especially over the weekend.
"Their visit served as a reminder that Pennsylvania is not just a prize to be won, but a community to be heard and understood."
"But I think, you know, his floor in the Rust Belt states is probably going to be around 47 to 48 as opposed to, you know, a ceiling of 46, right?"
"This deep dive has been kind of a whirlwind, to be honest."
"I think that one, she's had a great team to campaign on her behalf."
"It seems like a lot of the concern is coming from Philadelphia, which as we know is a Democratic stronghold in the state."
But I think the largest voting bloc are those who are not considering coming out to vote at all.
We're taking it back.
"Now eligible voters is probably more around 40,000."
The finish line is in sight.
"And all he did with it was give a tax cut to people who did not need one, and drove up the deficit in the process."
"But one thing is for sure, Pennsylvania is shaping up to be one of the most critical battlegrounds in the 2024 election."
"You know, they were going up against Trump's endorsement and there was no Democrat primary that was open on the governor's side."
"Well, I think the reason Trump is here is show strength, that he will not be chased away."
"In 2016, Sabatini wrote in a Republican Senator, Trump narrowly won Pennsylvania."
"The larger polls I'm seeing has Trump up by two or three, but that's within the margin of error."
And that is a lack of enthusiasm.
And the margin in the state's lower chamber is a single seat.
You won your race by 15 points here against your Republican opponent.
Trump and Harris are locked in a virtual tie in two out of eight polls.
"He's a great guy, great young athlete."
"And you know, no Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948."
And that sort of pessimistic sense of the economy has pervaded this election.
 Welcome to Pennsylvania in Focus.
"They need to hear more from her about what she truly believes in, what her policies are."
Let's just hear some music.
It's amazing how it works.
I can tell by looking at that guy.
"Why would you come here to not only show support, but also to sell merch to the people?"
"But I am going to start reacting to them a lot more, you feel me?"
"Pennsylvania, a state in flux."
It's about it.
Today's rally comes as calls from Democrats asking President Biden to step down grow.
"And of course, the will of the people will be respected."
"I mean, just looking up, it is awful."
"We can clearly see that the battle in Pennsylvania is extremely tight, because each candidate won polls with only one to two points of margin."
"So, and 4% of this exit poll was Jewish."
Oof.
"She's trying to convince voters in areas where Donald Trump's pretty popular to vote for her, at least cut into his margins."
"So tell me, what's it like A, to be home?"
9.
So the turnout is too low to really extrapolate.
"For me, I miss it so much down there in South Florida."
And what does that say about the state tonight?
"We do know that when Trump was president, he worked to try to overturn temporary protective status, those sort of visas for Haitian immigrants."
Do we believe in opportunity?
"And if what he meant is taking responsibility, well then yeah, he should take responsibility for the fact that one in three women in America lives in a Trump abortion ban, same."
"I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within, not even the people that have come in and destroying our country, by the way, totally destroying our country, the towns, the villages that are being inundated."
Both candidates have bet big on Pennsylvania.
"This shift was evident in the 2018 midterms, when several Republican-held congressional seats in the Philadelphia suburbs flipped to the Democrats."
And then they come here and then they're told to participate.
"Now that I've voted for who you wanted me to, can I have food and water, please?"
But also he represented a sprawling rural district in southern Minnesota for six terms in the U.S. House.
It means he's going to be supporting Donald Trump in the state of Michigan.
It's pretty amazing to me.
But the key is context.
But we have the capacity to feed upwards of four to five hundred.
"As a black man, we need to continue to remember what happened."
"Plus, it works really well because you and Aquafina have great chemistry."
"Your job, which is a good job, an energy job."
That's pretty wild.
"The bipartisan deal that Kamala Harris supported, even though it was written by one of the most conservative Republicans in Congress, and Donald Trump deliberately lobbied against it and told Republicans, don't vote for it."
I think she's doing what she needs to do.
I get it.
The Harris campaign is heavily focused around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and the suburbs around those cities.
"And all our generation sees student loans, issues with getting jobs, things like that, where obviously that ebbs and flows over time, no matter who's in the White House."
Let's say Trump carries Pennsylvania.
"Look, I think he brings the fact that he has served our country in the military, the fact that he is someone who's worked his way through life from a working class family."
That's the bluest of these seven states and you compare the polls now to the polls back then.
And there are some new rules in the state Republicans have been lobbying for.
"And although she is currently the Vice President of the United States of America, but as we know, the Vice President's role is not to overshadow the President."
"Senator, I got to ask you what in the world was happening in Wilkes-Barre with that Donald Trump David McCormick speech?"
I don't think this is a turnout election.
"Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan."
I Watched the way they asked questions of Kamala yesterday Howard Stern he's a weak a weak guy.
So this little bitch is crying that he didn't get selected for VP and not campaigning with the rest of the Democrats.
"And you could say, well, he doesn't have a contested primary."
"Democrats technically are increasing their raw vote totals and their firewall, which is expected because, you know, the mail-in vote is overwhelmingly Democrat."
I think that's the growth of this network as well.
"If it's tied, that's good."
This is horrible.
All right we'll see if Michelle comes out and changes the narrative out there on the campaign trail.
"And if you listen to his lies, it's like listening to Santa Claus."
"The majority of Americans that will decide this race in six swing states like in my home state of Pennsylvania will be the phone calls, the door knocking, the voter by voter that we need to do to win this race in 75 days."
I'm Sarah Budford and I'm here with managing editor Chris Irvine.
"I think the energy she's brought to the campaign, the fact that she's a woman and women's rights are, are going to be a big deal here in Pennsylvania."
So I imagine that we will kind of get all of the above when it comes to the former president's remarks.
Vote early if you can if you especially if you're in a swing state because you might not be able to on election day.
CNN said that's extremely different.
You don't have to vote for this administration again.
"But I think Trump is playing very smart politically, saying he's for exceptions, he said they ended the debate."

"So tell us who you're with and what they're saying about the debate Yeah, Anderson we talked about how critical Pennsylvania is for each candidates pathway to 270 electoral votes We're here in Erie County, Erie, Pennsylvania We're sitting currently at Mercyhurst University been wonderful host for us The reason why we're here 400 miles away from the debate is Erie County is the swingiest County in the most important swing state of This campaign."
That's massive change.
Kamala Harris what have you done that is what J.D.
"But yeah, I'd be happy to see a Shapiro."
Because they said that Donald Trump opened things up too quickly and he killed people because of it.
And remember how important this seat is.
But Pennsylvania Harris 51 Trump 45 Harris with a six point lead.
That ain't conservative or Republican.
It was crazy.
"This is a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice, who need a champion."
"Here, play this clip."
But what is this?
I Think what do you think has nothing to do with Pennsylvania?
So I'd really appreciate it if you keep coming back and watching those videos.
"As the polls currently stand, Trump holds narrow leads in Pennsylvania and Ohio, while Michigan is a virtual tide between Harris and Trump."
And that's what he's doing here.
"Oh, absolutely Absolutely."
It's tempering itself a little bit.
And this is what it takes.
"I mean you look at Nevada, you look at Georgia, North Carolina, all important states but from the perspective of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, you know for Harris or Trump there's no pathway to the presidency without one or multiple of these states."
You think they would practice for this stuff.
"Oh, she absolutely has."
"Not for fun, but you know, just as a hobby."
"So you can see Heels Up and President Trump are 48, 48, all right?"
They have to spend all this money.
"But he's had the benefit of these big super packs who are paying for most of his advertising for this, for the very reasons we just talked about."
I want to drain your swamp and take you to the deep state.
And this rambler doesn't know when to hold them and when to fold them.
"And I know there's a myth out there that'll say, well, Donald Trump is only polling so well because right-leaning pollsters, they say, are flooding the zone."
"We're gonna discount Rasmussen, not because I think he should discount Rasmussen, but everyone says, Rasmussen's a Republican leaning poll."
"It may all come down to the electoral college, which rockets Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro to the top of the list."
Please raise your.
He almost won it in 2016.
"And the production has come from private land, not government land, largely vast majority."
As we get closer and closer to the election and Republicans are more likely to use their right to early vote later in the early voting process.
"Because western Pennsylvania and its political proclivities are more like Wisconsin and Michigan, both also very important to the Harris Electoral College map."
Today's visit is the start of a three day swing in the vital battleground state for President Biden.
It's so nuts.
Some of them are remaining true.
His substantial contribution is a vote of confidence in Harris' ability to make housing more affordable and accessible.
"The court's ruling in Pennsylvania thus represents a pivotal moment in this ongoing debate, as it underscores the Republicans' commitment to reinforcing election security."
"So the majority of the polling group was female and there's a significant gender, what's the word, base for female for heels up versus men for Trump."
"And when President Trump was in the White House, I got to get up every single day and be on offense."
"While living Tennessee, you just registered to vote."
That's how it happened.
Anything else we should be keeping an eye on as we like keep exploring this topic?
How do you even know what to believe anymore?
And I think we're really seeing her push that and this media blitz.
And why is that important?
"But remember, Donald Trump was president for four years."
She's just moving.
"After all, she's been vice president, a U.S. senator, a state attorney general, a district attorney."
How's that working out for you?
"Let's see who's not just reporting and the volume of content they're reporting on, but look and see who was editing photography, who was adding color grading and filtered effects to photography, who was altering these images and focused points within them to make the content seem more anthemic than it actually is."
This does not represent President Trump.
There was a helicopter a couple of different times.
He's not being transparent.
"I agree with you, brother."
"But the measure in between, the people in between are really going to make the difference in this election."
Trump's hood.
Enough.
Real quick.
Politicians who are willing to work with people on both sides of the aisle to get stuff done and that in this race is Kamala Harris.
Well gentlemen Thank you guys for your time and enjoy their alley.
"So it's very, very important."
"The mediating countries, the US, Qatar and Egypt, have so far failed to narrow differences to reach an agreement."
So what'd she say?
"Here in Harrisburg, Harrisburg, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where Trump is about to take the stage 6pm."
Go ahead.
"He won Pennsylvania by 1.2%, Michigan by 2.8%, and then Wisconsin by 0.6%, and then Minnesota by a full 7 points."
"The success of Harris's campaign hinges on her ability to bridge this significant divide, ensuring that her messaging resonates with urban voters who prioritize social justice, equality, and health care, while simultaneously addressing the concerns of rural voters who are more focused on economic recovery, job creation, and the revitalization of their communities."
We have six hundred thousand jobs in Pennsylvania from fracking.
The stakes are unusually high in Maryland.
And that is a good thing.
What is clear is that Pennsylvania will continue to play a crucial role in determining the ultimate winner of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
And then I was saying this to Chris Stierwald.
"Yeah, there's a pathway for Trump, not through Pennsylvania."
And so I also encourage us not to overread into this moment.
"And especially the use of AI with the voice and things like that, they can manipulate it."
"Everybody's very nervous, he said."
See what else let me.
It's Friday.
You don't hear that every day.
"Moore also stressed the importance of focusing on critical issues like affordable housing and climate change, and he warned that Harris's campaign should be cautious about being linked to unpopular policies of President Biden, particularly his support for the war in Gaza."
 Let's go and put this next piece up on the screen.
I don't know all the specifics about it.
It's just it's a great environment.
Things that they have not shown that they want to do.
"And we, some of us who have less hair and are old enough, can remember when you could go to Thanksgiving, watch a Steelers game with your relatives and not complain about politics the whole time."
"You know, years ago, I went through his Trump brand products and found that the vast majority of them are made overseas, which had to be embarrassing for him, right?"
There have been a lot of positions that she took prior to 2020 in which she's changed course.
They're signing shells to bomb Russia from the United States made in America.
"But anyway, so King Midas, you know, he thinks his power is going to be great turning everything he touches turns to gold, but then he can't, you know, he can't smell flowers, he can't eat food, he can't have a drink and so on."
A little bit different than what we heard from him in 2020.
He's selling God bless the USA Bibles made in China.
"So you go to Pennsylvania House District 139, with just about all of the votes in, and the Republican won 58.3% to 41.7%, a margin of 16.6%."
"Good to see you, Aaron."
Are you gonna call any of your friends in Pennsylvania?
They are but for whatever reason people on Twitter are saying this is a high-quality poll.
"Okay, massive keyboard for life."
"I've said for a while now, watch his rallies."
I appreciate the opportunity to talk.
"I don't, I don't take, uh, you know, credit."
Royer.
"Two hours ago, so big tweets out Shapiro and Zelensky visits our visit artillery shell plant in Scranton."
The left has perverted that to the point to where it is this is my child's body which I will give up for me.
Guns take away their right to free speech.
"The state has seen an influx of new residents, particularly from other states, which has altered the political landscape."
"Walkers to what that, the significance of that, because I think a lot of people from, from the, from that perspective, don't realize how much of a fail that was, not only for JD Vance, who, who was able to fail onto himself, just a virtue of opening his mouth and existing, but also the campaign to walk into a shop that was, that was not only neutral on him, but kind of openly hostile to the, to the thought of him being there."
But what is not binary is either are the positions that are being taken right now overseas.
" tell you myself if I didn't have my faith, I'd go crazy."
People want an inspirational reason to come out to the ballot come November.
"The public's perception of her as a candidate, along with her ability to forge authentic connections with voters, will play a critical role in determining turnout and overall support."
"And even if they would still fall short, I'd rather have Trump fall short with somebody good and have the week end up winning the primary, than have Trump endorse the week and have them win the primary by a resounding margin."
Says you're fired and then it's like on the barrel of the gun.
"Thomas Reid â€“ $3 million Thomas Reid, a prominent figure in Pennsylvania's energy sector, has donated $3 million to Kamala Harris' campaign."
"Now, the other thing about this state today that I think is interesting, we're going to talk about this a little bit later in more detail, is the Senate races, because Casey, the Democratic senators, is in a tough race."
Does that mean it's a good economy?
Trump is winning in every single swing state.
"So I just thought it was a fierce debate, one substantive on issues that Pennsylvanians care about, but also one that got personal because it is so close, they've got to take each other down."
"I think her evasiveness, her failure to address the tough questions that were asked on issues like immigration, and her saying, I'll follow the law on several issues rather than saying what her actual position was."
Three percent of voters are still undecided.
"Congressman Scott Perry, Republican from the state of Pennsylvania."
So I get it.
"Pennsylvania is seen as pivotal for both sides, $500 million in TV ads."
"In particular, a key constituency."
I saw that New Jersey is suing New York City over its new congestion pricing.
Pennsylvania is the ballgame.
"Starting with the seventh poll, conducted by Spry Strategies from August 14th to 20, with 600 likely voters, Harris received 48% of the vote, while Trump received 47%."
The idea that we could legislate every scenario that a woman goes through in her reproductive health.
It's said by everyone all the time.
"The week before the DNC, she came to Pennsylvania and she didn't go to Philly or Pittsburgh."
"The agreement says that Ellis spoke with the prosecution the day before the lead prosecutor came out and told everyone, hey, plea deals might be in the works."
Voter registration doesn't matter either.
That's always in the description.
"He attended his rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, just last Sunday when the former president called Kamala Harris mentally impaired."
And now you've got the mail-in mail-in votes here declining significantly more 15%.
"Maybe if you go back to the Andrew Jackson days, I'm sure there was weird shit that happened then like him randomly deciding to duel somebody, something like that."
"And we'll talk about that in the primaries and the good and the bad of it, including that."
"That means that there are 300,000 hunters in Pennsylvania that are not registered."
"If you guys did enjoy this video, smash the like button down below, subscribe, share with your friends, hit that little bell, follow the social media account to the description down below and of course join the channel today."

Jeeves?
"You know, Judge Patricia McCullough is saying showed a wholesale abandonment of common sense and an ignoring precedent."
"But if Donald Trump would have listened to Democrats, the unemployment would have been worse because remember their number one criticism of Donald Trump was that he was letting people die by opening up the government and the economy too soon because he only shut it down for a month."
"So we kind of came in thinking we were going to get a good mix of voters, and I think we did that."
We also know these different kinds of things about what's going on with Kamala Harris being proactive as opposed to reactive.
She is the Vice President of the United States for having a sake.
"Obviously, things are changing here."
"Sources close to the campaign say it was Walz's leadership experience, his rapport with Harris and his communication skills that earned him the spot."
"Trump's team is okay with it being muted, saying it's the same rules as the CNN one."
Like they're finally taking this seriously.
"And here's Vice President Kamala Harris, and here she plays a montage of Donald Trump clips showing his own words."
His favorables were far higher.
We're struggling.
Thanks for having me.
That's what her focus is on right now.
"For this Suffolk poll here, they're literally rated number one."
"I think for me, like a lot of people, it's the economy."
"He shared a personal visit to Arlington Cemetery, honoring families who lost loved ones due to the Afghanistan withdrawal."
And then you know Trump has always run as an economic populist since he walked down that golden escalator nine years ago I guess almost a decade since he's been on the political scene.
"Yeah, but they still- You took brace for a long election."
"Yeah, we had cases."
"I mean, we all know that Kamala Harris is like, like, so left."
"And as you mentioned, Connell, rightly, that these are counties that Trump won in 2020 and 2016, both of them, but have previously gone for Obama, I believe Cambria County, in 2008."
"Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Leland Vitter, The Weeknd Show."
Hey Lana good to see you well.

"Kelly tells me that the Trump campaign told her that the former president will honor their family on Saturday, and she says they'll get a chance to meet with Trump before he speaks, and they may even be called on stage."
She does have a good track record.
Another Trump term with JD Vance would be far worse and would lead our country down a path that I don't think we could ever recover from.
"You might be able to win Nevada, but if you lose Wisconsin, it's over."
"So you're going to see the Harris campaign, the Trump campaign focusing on different areas."
"When I went to the rally, I got closer to the door as well."
He went to Jenkins Town today to see what Josh Appearo's neighbors think about his potential pairing.
"In his aqua net muddled brain, he turns little crowds into big crowds, into huge crowds."
"And yet when Donald Trump lies or cheats or bullies or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls service members like John McCain losers because they died in battle or were captured, when he calls fellow citizens Burman or the enemy within, people make excuses for it."
35 trillion crypto.
But the damage had already been done.
"And from that point, when Kamala Harris was attorney general, she went after drug smugglers, human traffickers."
"So as a real estate businessman, that is one of the main reasons why I feel like that she's not, as far as the economy goes, she's definitely not the right person for that."
"And if it is about the issues, then Republicans can win."
"You dumb racist white people, white Republicans, there's nothing going on."
I am doing all that I can to prevent Donald Trump from being reelected.
Politico saying Joe Biden's local ties and cultural roots kept him competitive and culturally conservative.
And that's why they leaked all the internal polls that said Biden was losing New Mexico.
"It wasn't just marginal, it was massive reductions."
"We also heard in Laura's report, Donald Trump rail against FBI crime statistics."
"For these rating classifications, in these videos, margins below 3 points are tilt, 3-7%, lean, 7-10%, likely, and then anything greater than 10 points is safe or solid."
I can say this about Pennsylvania.
I just came back from the dentist again.
Maybe there are some Trump voters who won't pull the lever from McCormick because they think he's a carpet bagger or whatnot.
"Yes, sir."
All that you see behind me is all shipping ready to leave on Tuesday.
"Well, he's first of all, Bob Casey is a great American supporting Kamala Harris."
"Once COVID was over, it was like building up in me during the period of lockdown and then once it ended, I was ready to go out there and make a difference."
"That's what we normally do during the monologue, yeah."
So that does it for this video.
 You saw the polls over the weekend.
Trump left office at the heart of COVID.
Some of the national polls suggest Trump's up again.
It was essentially a halfway to citizenship.
"Now, I never heard Kamala come in and say, do you mean fracking to Joe?"
"Faint political writer at the Los Angeles Times, Sima Mehta, told us both candidates are sharpening their attacks in those key states, even though, you know, obviously this is a national election, but ultimately it's going to come down to a handful of battleground states."
He delivered for them in his first term.
Let's see here.
Harris is underperforming with them.
"Yeah, good evening Natasha."
Explain that to our viewers.
Oz is better than McCormick in my view.
So do that.
These people should be put in jail the way they talk about our judges and our justices.
And apparently the internals have Trump up by around two to five points in Pennsylvania as of now.
Those campaign managers aren't idiots.
Because we do got the president coming up soon.
This is Marxist.
"But I think it's important to note that we shouldn't really, in my opinion, count any polls before the debate because that was a huge event and some of the polling numbers have really changed."
"I'll put some graphics on it and re-release it so it's easier to consume because I know on these live streams, sometimes I just ramble a little bit."
It's inflation.
It's definitely not over.
"At this point, this is the worst position a Democrat has been in in the last eight years."
"And if some other countries not playing fair in terms of trade, then you use it as a tool in your tool belt."
"And these supporters, they've been calling for a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas."
This isn't from some far-right news organization.
And America is not having enough.
So yeah Kamala is angry at the Pennsylvania state and local officials.
"What do you think the possible path to victory would be for his opponent, Republican David McCormick here?"
There are two things that are wrong with that.
She's going to New Hampshire on Wednesday.
"There were some medical incidents, two people for one and then another collapse were being treated."
Right now it's tied.
Hallelujah code and a broken.
Like you know those people will go to any length to retain that seat or to get to that seat.
"So so if you had to say one thing to people who were undecided to if there was people who were undecided and didn't know who to vote for this election, what would you tell them?"
"Now, let's analyze all the eight recent polls conducted in Pennsylvania."
"In the context of his statements, Shapiro emphasized that the outcome of the election in Pennsylvania might ultimately determine whether or not the current president is re-elected."
People are scared.
"It's immature, and it's using my body for spite."
The infrastructure investment is about defending freedom.
They will take a topic and then they will compare coverage of the topic across different biased sources.
And I think that's a tremendous asset that he brings to this ticket.
"It wasn't by a huge margin and it was close, but he did win."
"Whatever you do, you have to vote and make sure your ballot counts."
It should be killed.
"To the victor go the spoils really is the state of play in Pennsylvania, Terry Moran, our thanks to you as always."
This shouldn't even be a question.
So who do you want representing America?
Look at that.
"While Ohio may no longer be the quintessential swing state it once was, it remains an important part of the electoral map."
Is Harris going to do as well as Biden did in those places?
The Susquehanna missing the final result by two points in either direction for 2016 and 2020.
And that is resonating with voters.
But now the surveys seem to indicate that Kamala Harris is now pulling ahead of Donald Trump.
"If you want electric, great."
"All private sector, big law, Yale Law School, all of these different things that J.D."
How much are you selling these for?
On having a successful presidency.
"You don't have you know people that You don't need you don't need the buses you don't need to pay people to come to see Trump you don't need that You know, I mean you don't need none of that You literally have people that really comes to support Trump and listen what he has to say That's what you have you literally have that All these people That's lit red hats I Love it That's you need you need you need that kind of support this just goes to show you like real support though This is real support."
"Now, Pennsylvania, I think is going to be a very closed state."
Voter turnout will also be crucial in Pennsylvania.
I have been the best president for black people since Abraham Lincoln.
Let me show you a couple of things.
It is nonstop.
Biden's approval rating is below 40.
"If it wasn't for this, like there's a chance he could still win because of improvements in places like Chester and, you know, Lancaster."
"And just to go back to what Nathaniel was just talking about, one interesting thing that we're seeing at the last minute here is how the map has sort of changed a little bit."
33 million.
"So if Donald Trump were to win Pennsylvania, he really wouldn't need much more, just 16 electoral votes."
There's a lot of votes.
It says independent presidential candidate Cornell West lost the legal challenge Friday in his bid to get on the ballot in the ballot ground battleground state of Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court judge Renee Cone Jubileerer in a 15 page opinion sided with the Secretary of State's office under Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro in rejecting West candidacy paperwork The Secretary of State's office said West campaign lacked or card affidavits for 14 of the West 19 presidential electors So what I think is kind of going on to I don't know if that's the case here But what it looks like is I guess a lot of the states required maybe in addition to signatures also these electors who are Promising to vote for you But what ended up happening in the state of Arizona?
"When you have all these other polls, they're saying tie, tie, tie."
Now that Kamala Harris is building out this advantage and expanding her lead.
I've decided.
"So at this point, it's more of a question on the margins."
"These people, they're going to vote early."
Let me look at the two different kinds of statistics he's talking about.
"When he came down the escalator, I thought, oh, this is crazy."
He blamed a lack of air conditioning and called for music to be played.
"They are a left-leaning pollster, and they found the race at best tied for Harris."
It gets a lot worse.
As the first state of early voting kicked off here in Georgia on Tuesday a top election official here in Georgia says by 4 p.m. more than 250 thousand people have cast their vote shattering the state's early voting turnout record on the first day.
You're telling me that not a single person said that.
It's not a cry.
What do you put that down to?
They're garbage.
And that's what Dr. Oz did.
And you'll see Erie and Northampton are voting against Harris.
He's outside of Pittsburgh.
We did see some blood coming from his ear.
"And now I've been predicting whether it was Joe Biden or where now that it is the vice president Harris, I knew that was gonna be close."
We have a state director.
"The Harris campaign and its allies have locked in $77 million in ads for Pennsylvania, showcasing just how important the state is to both sides."
That's a point three margin.
This man's life is in jeopardy.
The evidence showed that Nancy Pelosi should have had protection at the Capitol that I offered her and they turned it down.
Perry Russum is in Washington.
What do they want to see from both candidates?
You don't even have the cost of an air conditioner if they have them in this beautiful factory anyway.
There was no state of the union bump whatsoever.
"Looking at the graph, we can see that it is a highly contested battle between Harris and Trump."
"So I Know that a lot of you guys are gonna say oh, well, this is not a big deal Most of Cornell's voters are gonna go elsewhere anyways, but the thing is is for Cornel West It doesn't matter necessarily like where the votes go in terms of like, okay, maybe you're thinking well Hey, even if like point seven of his 1% or his hundred percent of voters like goes towards, you know Jill Stein or nobody else."
Where you have the blue wall strategy and you have the sunbelt strategy.
But check it now.
So I'm looking at this information from a website called VoteHub.us.
"I'm from right down the road, like a 30 second drive."
"So that's not, though, where the whole story of Pennsylvania ends."
61%.
Would y'all mind if I like pick on Donald Trump a little bit?
"We do not want to hand him the keys back to the White House where he can continue to try and divide us, offend people, and spew more hatred and bigotry in our society."
Why do you think CNN is putting distance between them and Harris?
"And we do know that even if Trump wins Pennsylvania by two and a half to three, that's still a close race."
"Yeah, I believe that Trump has turned it over to the states for the states to regulate it And I believe that was the best decision to make Were you happy to see Roe v. Wade be overturned on the heels of Trump's Supreme Court appointees?"
But even they found Harris up by only three.
Or Deflate Gatsby.
Make sure you follow me on x links.
"We may not, they may not appreciate the work now, but the time is going to come."
"And helping us to sort through that is Mike Noble, the CEO and founder of Noble Predictive Insights, who joins us now on Arizona's Morning News."
So I know like personally we're not thrilled about the environmental impact of it but we know that the money is important to people.
Because you know what happens?
But also you have a pollster that had Donald Trump trailing the last poll called the Muhlenberg College poll.
"But helping to reinvigorate skateboarding, getting young people interested, getting people to get their kids interested in being physically fit, physically active, creative."
"And it seems to be a lot more tougher race than what it was before, because Trump had the age factor going on in his favor, because even though he's just three years younger than Biden, a lot of people had been criticizing Biden for his age and not Trump."
Here's what president Biden had to say today.
Let me do this.
"I think I say Wilkes-Barre, most of all."
So I'm going to have to ask you for a really quick answer on this one.
This has to stop.
"So you could be an infiltrator and say, Hey, I'm a Republican."
"So if you are there and you're doing something that is in this area, even if it's a couple of miles away and I know ahead of time I can plan for it, take off work and do what I need to do, I will be there in person and I'll bring some people with me and we will help publishing the work."
"I operate on who has the best plan, who has the best policies."
"I think the Republicans have always flirted with the idea, certainly in the last few years, that they can chip away and maybe even turn New York red."
"The boy's father has also spoken out, really asking Trump to stop."
"Amish f conservative, their quali everything to them."
It's a different electorate.
"Now, the problem for Democrats is they're making it sound like it's 85 percent of Democrats are going to vote on Election Day."
Biden barely won Pennsylvania.
"It's not as big a deal throughout the state as people think, but in part as to the state, it's a very big deal."
We could like put a little bit of video there.
When did that become okay?
So it says court stops Pennsylvania counties from throwing out mail-in votes over incorrect envelope dates.
He observes Shabbat.
"And Michael, great to be with you and Simone and Alicia."
"When Trump was asked the question, he very succinctly said, drill baby drill."
What exactly happened last night?
"Understanding this context is critical for any candidate aiming to connect with voters across the spectrum, particularly in regions that have experienced economic hardships."
And I think the third thing is she has to show herself as a moderator who can appeal to centrists.
Of Senator Vance.
"Here, Donald Trump believes he's speaking on Saturday afternoon."
"You saw folks excited, energized."
And that's really all that matters because we have pretty much enough voters already in the country to win.
She sat down with Margaret Brennan over the weekend on Face the Nation to talk about the Democrats' hopes of retaining the House as high as an uphill climb that might be.
So the sun is rising on a heartbroken community.
"The former president actually went on Univision and took some very tough questions, including for one Latino farmer who picked strawberries and said his job is usually done by undocumented workers."
Jerry Flynn.
"Both candidates are practically living in Pennsylvania, with Kamala Harris making multiple stops across the state and even participating in the Sept. 10 presidential debate held in, you guessed it, Pennsylvania."
Available at Bass Pro Shops.

He's up in most polls in Wisconsin.
"If I were in Harris' situation, I would think very strongly about the difficulties that some women experience being in a top-level position, and having men around them that have to be satisfied with being second, third, or answering to a woman, she told the outlet."
Casey himself is at 48% as well.
"We see a New Jersey and New York, the Mid-Atlantic as a whole, even Virginia is not doing so hot."
"This is not going to win him any votes and in fact could potentially cost him some votes in some of these swing states where they say, look, why should we be spending money on, more state and local tax deductions for people who live on the coast when I'm living in Nevada or Pennsylvania or Michigan and I need to see my household budget get more relief."
And it's even tighter race when it comes to the presidential.
They don't want to give us air conditioning.

And I think they're the and it should be very easily handled by if necessary by the national guard or if really necessary by the military because they can't let that happen.
All of this chaos that we're seeing in the world right now can be laid right at the feet of the Harris Biden administration.

I'm sorry.

And let's take a step back and talk about Pennsylvania as a whole.
Let's take a look at the next clip.

She went away.
"In the first five minutes, Vice President Harris talked about her plan to expand small businesses and give new small business owners a $50,000 tax deduction to help them afford to start a business."
"Meanwhile, Trump has enlisted the help of former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard to prepare for his upcoming debate with Harris."
"He's an incumbent Senator, so it makes sense that a lot of Pennsylvanians know who he is."
"Casey returns, looks at McCormick."
But anyway switching gears a little bit from one state to another and from one sense to another of the campaign we are in the final few weeks and we've noticed that there's been kind of an explosion in populist economics from both campaigns in these closing weeks.
"Trump made comments criticizing Biden-Harris policies, focusing on the border and public safety."
It's a message to his opponents.
They're all in line to support Donald Trump.
"And in part, they see an opening to define Harris."
So here's this guy coming down the escalator.
"So heck, if there were kids out here, I could put them to work."
She's not going to win Pennsylvania by four or five points.
And there's no true test and courage under fire.
We knew that was going to come.
You see Trump going in with an earring?
"No, never."
They dropped a poll with Trump leading by three percentage points.
"So the economy has been a tough sell for President Biden throughout this campaign, as you well know, is his campaign advisers point to metrics and say, look, things are actually going pretty well."
Let's be honest about it.
"Now, that of course may be what they're experiencing."
Outside of the Cuban American and Puerto Rican communities.
"So, there have been major concerns about the security surrounding Donald Trump's rallies."
Put down your phone and do what?
"So look, I'll take our surrogate game against the other side seven days a week and twice on Sunday."
"I really want to know how that's somehow good news for Harris because if if the point error is the exact same, which there's a possibility it could be off even more right now because of the insane response bias."
"I mean, I read a so-called Republican who Ronald Reagan didn't like, by the way, and she didn't like him."
We're going to find out that he was part of a group of people who feel disenfranchised.
How does he respond to some of that criticism?
They both lie a lot.
He's up by around two to three points.
It is really fascinating.
Scott can you tell us a bit of what you're seeing now?
"But around the time that Joe Biden dropped out of the race, it was at a 35 percent chance, nearly a third of the odds in favor of the Democrats."
"At that point, I think it's going to be a lot different this cycle."
Everything looks very good for it.
"Well, she didn't leave quietly."
"In Pennsylvania, which has a high number of electoral votes, the party with the most votes will be one step closer to becoming the next president of the United States."

Have a wonderful day wherever it is you are.
"The last time an attempt at a U.S. president's life was actually successful was 1963, John F. Kennedy."
"Oh yeah, yeah."
Let's talk about what that creator said about the polls and let's talk a little bit about what Trump getting shot at is going to do.
The polls say it is a toss up.
Maybe he's a supporter.
"Keep in mind, he's been active in politics now in that area."
I want to just experience that.
"And they don't know why they should trust Kamala Hara, who's had four years to do something and hasn't done anything and now is acting like she's going to change all this around."
"No, it's Pennsylvania."
Kamala Harris doesn't exactly have that point of strength.
I happen to agree with Nate Silver.
"I mean, if we all collectively had a dollar for every time we talk to someone that said, you know, I don't like the way he speaks, but you know, I'm not voting for him because I think he's a great person."
So I did previously report on how Kamala Harris is actually already gearing up for a legal battle for the election results after.
The significance of this poll lies not only in the close numbers but also in the broader context of voter sentiment in Pennsylvania.
This is the Lancaster Democrats' headquarters has been for a number of years.

That's not good.
"Now they're yelling at us, some of the members of the crowd gesturing towards us and screaming of all guarantees at the media."

Pennsylvania is the most likely candidate.
"Now, one of the things that Harris campaign is learning is that in 2016, this was a complete blind spot for Hillary Clinton's campaign."
They're often dead.
This is this is the worst possible scenario at an event like this.
But she's worse than him.
We have discernment and all the other songs he played.
They're lead in terms of voter registration Democrats versus Republicans in the state of Pennsylvania.
"You get the sense that both campaigns need every demographic, and they're trying to get every vote they can."
Arizona is incredibly close.
But Trump has an ego to him.
And that helped Trump because his enthusiasm numbers were through the roof compared to Biden.
That's called Marxism.
"So, but I think it's just unbelievable that we, that you should be able to feel safe walking around American cities."
And the vice president Harris is a far superior campaigner than Joe Biden.
"Well if we consider tracks here, sir, the data on the economy and voter feeling about it has been tracking more in favor of Kamala Harris, at least relative to how Joe Biden was doing on some of these metrics, which does make me wonder if it's still the best line of attack that Republicans can use against not just her but Democrats by and large if we are seeing sentiment around the economy starting to change even if with somewhat of a lagged effect."
Can you tell me a little bit more about what brought you out?
Where's then the raw data?

You don't believe in humanity.
He couldn't go up there and talk about public education because he doesn't believe in the institution of public education.
And you think Donald Trump can change that?
You go to other parts and the Harris signs are up.
We have to keep fighting.
"Yeah, the article talked about this noticeable shift and the reactions were all over the map."
Are you excited to be at a Trump rally right now?
That's battleground Arizona right there.

"Trump is doubling down on his appeal to the state's industrial workers and rural communities, emphasizing his commitments to job creation and energy independence."
"Again, a point or less, and so I think what folks need to do is not worry about what those polls show, but just keep working and what I'm seeing on the ground is real enthusiasm for Kamala Harris folks, not only pledging to vote for her, or maybe even some of voted for her by mail already, but they're showing up at the local office and taking a shift and going out and knocking on doors in rural areas where maybe Democrats haven't performed as well in the past."

"So this is in line with what you would expect, and when you look at it, Donald Trump, among those definitely voting close to 50%, this is a brutal poll for Joe Biden out of Pennsylvania."
So definitely 46% of the economy is good and excellent.
What a load of crap that's not going to happen.
The president has been struck.
That remains to be seen.
What's particularly interesting in this state is the way in which the electorate has shifted.
That's a really small margin.

 Former President Trump held a rally in Pennsylvania on a rainy Friday night for GOP Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz.

This is Scranton.
"This has packed a lot of reaction, it has packed a lot of conspiracy theory, it has packed a lot of analysis, people are reacting to it."

"And then came another point where flank Franklin and Marshall College, which again is the in state in house pollster in Pennsylvania, one of the best pollsters in the state, showing Kamala Harris with a three point advantage."

Both sides of the U.S. political scene declare that it is their formula for peace that is better.
So they're right there with MSNBC watchers.
I handle all of the customer relations for our on the farm market and our customers often share their concerns with me.
"The temperament here is it's a lot larger, more people than I would thought would be here."
What makes it different?
Kamala surrounds herself with yes men and people who are sort of in the in the no apparatus.
That's the kind of President Kamala Harris will be.
"And you know, when you talk to the Amish, they're just so down the earth."
"When it comes to Pennsylvania, yes, there are certainly some questions from more ideological conservatives about some of Mehmet Oz's past positions on issues like gun control and abortion."
"So again, it comes down to not just how you experience it, but what you believe is happening in the country that kind of underpins a lot of that vote and why it doesn't move."
Keep the pin in your hand and it's right here.
"You know, I mean artwork."
What are you watching?
"McCormick clearly distinguishing himself on key policy ideas, which is something Casey didn't really do when I pressed him on it."
"But the fact is, if she's doing this bad with Catholics in Notre Dame, what do you think is happening everywhere else?"
All of you.
 Hello guys and welcome back to another video.
I am a normal person.
"Yeah, right."
America has never.
But these open primaries coupled with a lot of big money.
"I know, I don't even want to give them tips."
It's so true.
"And obviously people will say, well, you know, there's going to be more mail-in ballots in 2020 because of the pandemic, but this is comparing both Republican and Democrat."
"It's been brewing, it's been gaining, it's been building, and it only continues to build."
You hit search on the bottom right corner.
But let me say this.
Trump sitting plus point three.
There was a lot packed in.
"And I think that's one of the plans moving forward is when you look at the American people, most middle class families, their number one asset is actually their home."
And then I went back to the White House and I started throwing hamburgers at the wall.
"The bipartisan deal that Kamala Harris supported, even though it was written by one of the most conservative Republicans in Congress, and Donald Trump deliberately lobbied against it and told Republicans don't vote for it because he figured that if you passed it, he would not be able to engage in the same kind of fear mongering that he's been doing."
I said it was 16.
"But I would say personally, I prefer polls."
She said she was going to ban fracking.
"She is a United States Senator, significant consequence."
That's what he's looking for.

I want to hear from you.
They're eating the dog fish.
"As we know in the US elections, it's all about that electoral college vote and amongst the seven swing states, none has more of those electoral votes than Pennsylvania."
"This was provoked by the rhetoric, AOC, Biden, Schiff, Pelosi, Christopher Wray, all of them."
"Democrats are the party of crime, the party of chaos and the party of death."
Thank you guys Is there a particular policy or something that Trump talks to that excites you the most?
"But right now you're not these are bad numbers for Democrats because like I said, it's not just you know, it's a drop off from both parties."
"First, I wanna ask which candidate is leading so far?"
"We need law and order and we need legal immigration, which President Trump has always been a proponent of."
These people are over here whispering.
Nope.
How can that be?
That is a very interesting dynamic to watch and whether that gap closes as we get closer.
And Pennsylvania is among those handful that has the most electoral college votes among the states that ultimately decide this election.
"And there were significant numbers of people in both Wisconsin and Michigan, who are both important battleground states that did choose to vote sort of uncommitted."
"But you know, in terms of these big states, the big seven, we're talking about Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and then Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada."
"Because love it or hate it, everyone's talking about DJ Trump now."
"But no, he dropped out and endorsed McCormick, the worst candidate in the race, a train wreck, a globalist, a neoliberal Republican, who has been aligned with the left on pretty much every social issue."
"No, I don't think surprised would be a word I would use for that."
"That window of time between the polls closing and races being called, I think has shown to be a real vulnerability where people seeking to undermine confidence in those results if they're going to lose have really exploded."
Tiny changes.
She's my jackpot.
"And then as soon as they felt that it was clear, they were able to get him and move him to a van."
"Harris's lead in this poll is significant, but Trump's ability to secure 45% of the vote indicates that his core supporters remain engaged and enthusiastic."
"Biden carried it by one percentage point in 2020, making Erie County kind of a bellwether."
"Yeah, that case has been embroiled in a lot of controversy with district attorney Fonnie Willis And questions about whether she will even remain on the case as she had a relationship alleged relationship with the prosecutor on the case as well So a few charges dropped on that Trump not commenting on it at this moment He did not mention it yesterday at all, but he does talk often about how his court cases are Quote rigged against him and he believes he will defeat them all so allies I spoke to yesterday on the Trump campaign just kind of shrugged it off and said look it's just part of Kind of what we've been dealing with with these court cases They said that they are confident that Trump will beat all of them and you know We'll be looking to see if any of these court cases really come to fruition and come on the docket before November time is really ticking out especially for Jack Smith in Washington DC, right?"
"Like, maybe this is just misinformation, whatever."
"Visionary artists, a lot of them take a lot of plant medicines and get in touch with themselves."
"No, sorry."
He should have stayed in.
Look at this house.
"So, can Kamala Harris win Pennsylvania?"
I was about to say I saw I saw the EGA there.
And Clinton we saw in Georgia today trying to talk with voters ahead of early voting there that starts tomorrow.
"And I think this time Trump's going to be the winner in Florida, probably within an hour because they do the early the mail in voting early."
But I think that there's still a lot of concerns and it's not clear in people's minds whether things were really any better under Donald Trump than they are under Joe Biden.
I've been hearing a lot from Kamala Harris lately.
Please be serious.
"Because together, we've got a chance to choose a new generation of leadership in this country and start building a better and stronger and fairer and more hopeful America."
"It's like, is it a different place?"
"Now is the final in 2022, roughly 68%."
"Kamala already worked with Joe Biden to take on the drug companies, bring down the cost of insulin."
I don't run away by people but what can we do?
"Early voting, of course, underway."
"He's here, America's favorite fish."
"Because if Trump wins Pennsylvania, well, at that point, he just needs Georgia, and he's at 270."
They're threatened constantly.
"But in the last several months since the Israel-Gaza war has broken out, a lot of these voters are starting to turn away from the left because of some liberal lawmakers pro-Palestinian stance."
"This year, the organizations have been thrust into the national spotlight in a new way."
"Welcome to Reporter's Notebook, where we talk to the Washington Examiner's top journalists about the stories breaking on their beats."
"Yeah, it shows a shift on it from our last poll in September."
And I like Alex Scheld's response here.
"Personally, one, he does benefit, would benefit from a salt cap increase."
"If you just want to take a look at Donald Trump's performance in a number of these counties, Donald Trump is significantly underperforming as well in Pennsylvania."
"Yes, that's about as big as we can get them."
"If you haven't yet, make sure you do the homework as well."
"The speaker criticized financial disparities in climate agreements, noting that nations like China, India, and Russia contribute little to climate funding, placing an unfair burden on the U.S."
"Now, so those are his intentions."
"Now, we know this election is going to be tight."
But while Trump says his policies will bring companies back to the US without raising costs for consumers.
"2017 Republicans are plus one, a seven point swing from 2020 to 2024."
"And in Pennsylvania, it was called a red mirage, because it looked like Trump had all these more votes because they didn't count the absentee votes until that day."
"Yeah, I mean, it's only recently that he's like regained his power of speech."
You're working on two paintings at one time or what's going on?
It's why everyone ought to be watching CBS and watching the debate and see what see what transpires.
"They wanted to see, OK, what's happening in Pennsylvania when it comes to voter registration."
"And I can say talking to voters at these rallies, that is something that comes up time and time again as the top issue of concern."
Thompson's contribution is a testament to his confidence in Harris' ability to lead the nation to economic prosperity.
And look at all this Trump support.
It's not the college educated.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"Final question, if this election were to be held tomorrow, where would you be putting your money?"
That's what strength looks like.
"Oh, it's a Trump lead on the RCP average."
"As Barack Obama continued to open a bigger can of worms after addressing the crowds from the podium, he spoke to a group of black men separately."
But they're both okay.
"No, I think that Biden is a strong pillar for her in a lot of areas."
"You know, if you get Georgia and Pennsylvania, you don't even need Wisconsin."
"Well, I also think the negative partisanship from Republicans is really taking hold."
"Trump low prices going that way, but you can see way over there."
This is my good friend.
That's a one off.
A lot of people in my state support their families and feed their children by working in the fracking industry.
We're going to have to see if another Atlas Intel drop is coming.
The suburbs of Ohio have also been a key battleground in recent elections.
"They mentioned in the article that, you know, her numbers started to do better in the Rust Belt region after they chose Tim Walz as a nominee."
"You know Kamala Harris said just the other day in an interview that if she could do it all over again, what would she change?"
"It sort of depends on like, you know, there was like back in the in the days where like Joe Lieberman was around and, you know, Evan Bayh."
Now watch any of these videos to know the latest poll results of another state.
He's a hot mess.
"I mean, look at the then partisanship if she gets elected, it's all out the window."
I would imagine they're comparing where we're at right now in early September of 2024 with where it was in 2020.

"Sophia Adams â€“ $7,500,000 Sophia Adams, a tax-free, affordable housing Adams, a tech billionaire from Pittsburgh, has contributed $7.5 million to Kamala Harris' campaign."
But it seems a little inappropriate to me but that's Kamala Harris.
"Wrote Judge Ellen Seisler in the majority opinion, siding with the left-leaning groups that sued three months ago."
"So city officials said that at that last rally, they submitted a bill to Donald Trump for $35,129 and he has refused to pay it."
"And this is one of the absolute, you know, battleground states, right?"
It was hopeful.
"So what's at stake there, Luzerne County, for Harris and Trump?"
"Obviously, we like trade protectionism, but we also want to be tough on the border."
"For Harris to achieve a victorious outcome, she must inspire and galvanize high voter turnout in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburban areas, where a significant concentration of educated voters, particularly women and minorities, resides."
She's changing the momentum and she's building out a broader coalition in a way that Democrats had not been able to be able to do under Joe Biden.
"So I mean, there is a track record, especially on the border."
They're going to help guide them in there.
Do you really think George is gonna vote Democrat if Harris is losing Pennsylvania?
"And the numbers not only are consistent, but they come from some of the best pollsters in Pennsylvania, a state that will matter the most in this election."
"You know, you're talking about close to 10 point gains with these types of voters, and that would put him at 50 percent."
"We're all humans, human endeavor means you will have partisan beliefs, what they choose to put in their polling averages is unlike what we see on 538, which has Kamala Harris ahead in the 538 average, unlike what we see on VoteHub, unlike what we see on other organizations that do the same work."
"So Josh Shapiro, for example, won Lucerne County, Tom Wolf won it twice, but chances are the Democratic candidates going to lose it by 10% or even more."
"You know, that kind of rhetoric is garbage."
A sample size large enough.
"You need something to give them a permission structure to know that like, even if you voted for Republicans your entire life, that it's okay."
You don't really care that there was a secret chord.
"I would note that Al is a Republican, because I believe that the administration of elections in this country should not be partisan exercises."
I love America.
It's definitely complex.
"Again, we don't know exactly, but just for the sake of argument that might be out here."
What's coming and they cannot stop it.
"So how do you see abortion, Ozzy, at this point impacting this race so close to Election Day, if at all?"
"I mean, that is that is the number one thing that she needs to penetrate between now and election day is really selling herself as I'm a good person and I can handle the economy."
In fact this kind of civil war is exactly the kind of problem Hillary Clinton suffered from at times.
" Look, I think it's more of the same from Donald Trump, someone who doesn't show the kind of respect to the military that our men and women in uniform deserve."
"Based shit, man."
What do we find that happens because of that?
Pennsylvania has quite a few of them.
Better.
The other polls were Clifton plus nine Joe by seven.
The economy from the middle class out.
"And so it's so, so, so incredibly fascinating that we are at this point, where we come out from an election, where Donald Trump should have been raising, you know, a lot of money, the conviction helps him raise more money that he could use in battleground states, yada, yada, yada, yada, the assassination attempt, again, the RNC, JD Vance, all of these things that should in theory, should in theory have helped Donald Trump as a candidate, and then Joe Biden drops out of the race."
"I'm going to find this slide here because what you see is it depends on what you think has been going on in the country in relation to, here we go, gender equality efforts."
"Harris led in three out of the seven polls, with points ranging from one to two."
"Now research shows that wealth creation, entrepreneurship, police reform, and anti discrimination policies in the workplace are prominent issues for many younger black men."

We look forward to hearing more with you at five.
It's all on this now.
"It played for a good half hour after that at her event in Northeastern Pennsylvania, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about Trump's suggestion that he would use the military to go after his political enemies."
Just about your outlook on life and your future.
Both campaigns are fully aware of the stakes.
"Usually when you're the second highest vote getter going into a convention, you have a bright political future."
"This would be interesting in I don't know if a majority of Polish voters go Republican, but like a good amount of them go Republican So we're kind of with the Haitian vote for the most part you'd be dealing with just boosting turnout Which would boost your numbers here you would potentially be dealing with you know flips right?"
"So we'll wait and see exactly how, if at all, more information surfaces and what is done to disseminate it or report it if it makes sense to."

"Oh, she is so trashy too."
We appreciate you.
"Well, I find it interesting."
"There was a recent judicial decision with regards to the certification of the election there, which I find hilarious."
You would expect more Republicans leaving the party.
I don't know if I'll have a future.
"That survey says of the 50 economists who responded to the survey's question on inflation, 68% said prices would rise faster under Trump than under Harris."

Listen into what he had to say.
He then calls Vice President Kamala Harris a new fighter.
And then what we call the Northern Wall.
Quinnipiac had Trump losing seniors by like three.
Vice President Kamala Harris has doubled down on the sentiment and called on Donald Trump to release his medical records.

"You know, I love our democracy."
"The fact is, the FBI didn't report them because the new numbers were just released."
I think that's a legitimate argument.
"He's he's technically not dropped out He's suspended his campaign in swing states is gonna stay on the ballot in blue and red states So that's gonna give her a boost so Cornell not being on these ballots is absolutely huge These margins are gonna be really small like in the state of Michigan, for example, you know, the margin was 0.23% so We can actually take a look here over at the you know polls right now in Pennsylvania So in the polls in Pennsylvania right now Harris is up by 1.8 Which is solid, but I do believe if she wishes to wish to win the state of Pennsylvania She's gonna have to perform better than this."
It was his first event in the Keystone State since the assassination attempt on July 13.
"Because while I appreciate that you've been willing to speak out against the lies being spewed by Donald Trump, the fact that you're still voting for him makes your defense of your Haitian constituents ring pretty hollow."
When I saw him get up and just my understand my history of Trump just seeing how strong he is and how much we need strength as in leadership in our country.
"All right, the cost of gas."
"Now, of course, different things that can mean different things to different people, but Gallego at 60, reasonable, and Lake at almost 60 as extreme."
This is lying.
"My gosh, this would be horrifying."
"Now the details on that, they didn't have any of the specifics on when or where this might be, but just that this is in the works."
And we still have a cohort of people who are the least likely to or less likely to need medical care.
But why do you think that message is read is resonating with so many Pennsylvania voters and how do you push back against that if you're Harrison and in your role as a surrogate for her?
"I'm laughing, but it's not funny."
"And that was, and you tell me you had this on your bingo card."
"Also, please remember to share this video with your friends and family if you really, really, really like the video."
I think it's a 0.4 percentage point average for Harris and Trump.
"You, you would be worried if your grandpa was acting like this."
As we move closer to November.
"But wait, it gets worse when it comes to tariffs with Donald Trump."
This is not a problem.
It's true for most voters in Pennsylvania.
A win there could be a big indication of just who will win the election overall.
"But it's every single poll showing a shift towards Trump, including the Republican favorable ones like insider advantage."
"So just to be clear, you will go to Chicago to be a part of the convention."

"Now, you talk about reaching out to voters."
They were claiming that Biden actually won Pennsylvania by seven back in 2020.
"I mean it's scary to think about at this point, but I'm feeling more hopeful than I have in a long time, so it's really exciting."
Do you feel like you've got security in your job and if you were to lose it would it be pretty easy to get a comparable one or would it be really hard?
We all know that.
She drew the Hallelujah.
She's still trying to make me a little bit better.
"Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, that was the three states that put Trump over the edge in 2016."

"The question is, will Northampton County or Erie County be in the hands of Donald Trump or Kamala Harris?"
"Now, I will say we did not see this strong of a run up in our daily numbers whatsoever."
The upcoming debates between Harris and Trump are highly anticipated and could be pivotal in swaying undecided voters.
Kamala Harris might want to think about that.
He was polling terribly.
Absolutely she can take the state.
"I'm like, are you insane?"
It's voter registration.
It's Kamala.
"I think it could impact the discourse, but so far the discourse has not really impacted the general election quite a bit, although I will say that if Hunter does not get jail time, it's going to be really hard to justify putting Trump in jail and seeing it significantly hurt him because that's just going to be the two-tier justice system on full display, unlike anything we've ever seen."
This is actually one of the few places where former President Donald Trump won that is actually represented by a Democrat in Congress.
Sent people to jail.
"To show his love, try to win over the people of Pennsylvania to his side to become Republicans or whatever."
Hey Joe.
And yet here I am talking about the crises that are unfolding thousands of miles away.
It's nice to see a two as the first number.
And this is a sample?
We had to talk about the 2024 presidential election because it appears that Donald Trump's on pace for a big victory in Pennsylvania.
We've talked about it and we'll continue to talk about it.
Those are the ones I'm expecting.
Then someone has a medical event at the event and Donald Trump says the individual should lose weight.
"Here we go, everybody."
But those are kind of the two issues that have become really an issue for him when it comes to being chosen as the VP.
Decide the poll of the revisionist history of his years.
"Now, I talk about the I call them ping pong counties a lot, like Erie County up in the Northwest."
"Donald Trump in a lot of the Western Pennsylvania counties sees saw gains even in 2020, despite losing ground nationwide and losing ground in the state as a whole."
Southern Pennsylvania.
"Yeah, if you're wanting clarity here or a good read on who's going to win, this is not the place."
A solid two point advantage for Harris.
Those are the two counties.
And a poll last week by high ground public affairs shows Harris leading Trump by almost three points within the margin of error.
She wants to confiscate your guns.
"So This is an absolutely massive thing for her which is her ability to get these as well in the state And so she needs to continue she's surging right now as it pertains to Hispanic voters and so hopefully she'll be able to keep it up I do have actually a hot take that I'm kind of toying with as well and that's I think that Pennsylvania is actually more likely to go blue than Wisconsin and so the reason why I actually say that is because for the poll numbers Pennsylvania here You can see was won by about 1.2 If we go through and we check the polls back in 2020 for Pennsylvania Joe Biden's up 4.7, right?"
"OK, let's move on."
"His name is going to be on there, embossed, right next to Luke and Mark and Matthew."
"So Guns N' Roses, I'm sure not pleased with Trump's music being used."

"Again, return on investment."
You have one poll that's a little bit right-leaning and for Breezio.
Universal free breakfast.
We heard last night from the local sheriff.
They have voted the exact same since I believe 1988.
"There's crowd stood behind him, which also is concerning."
"Well, it is a very polarized society right now."
So great to see a substantive conversation between the two campaigns on something like this.
And I think that the voters will be listening really strongly to the message on those kitchen table issues.
"Coffee, it stinks big time."
"So, they're trying to address something that they believe was a shortcoming of Hillary Clinton's campaign."
Where do we go from there?
President Biden spending his time talking to the people.
"And just in our last few seconds with you, I know that Trump will address Hispanic voters at a Univision town hall today."
"Like, like, like that's, that's the thing."
"When you look at this, he could very well flip a county like Lackawanna County, which is where Scranton is."

"But check this out, it gets even better."
"Nobody name up I get enough of it when y'all say stuff about you know, Kamala and I mess up her name, but Gotta Puerto Rican rapper, you know, I've never heard of him but they said that I guess that he was trending because one of the His wig flew off his head That's wild that's wild he felt it though he felt it it'd have been bad if he didn't notice a real blessing to be here I'm from Puerto Rico We've we yeah, we a big part of United States we really depend on the United States Since Trump hasn't been around Puerto Rico's."
The economy was higher inflation was lower things were better overall and now with Kamala's Administration things haven't been so fantastic and she's saying she can fix the problems that her administration has caused But I just don't know if I can afford to take that risk Were you leaning towards the former president coming in tonight?
"Well, part of it is you don't just throw around the idea of just tariffs across the board."
"Caitlin, it sounds like Bob doesn't have the reporting quite hammered out with regard to what role former President Trump plays in this effort to repeal no excuse mail-in voting."
Cheese steak.
It's not even like he's talking like a Republican.
And our polling also gives us a read on where voters are on the issues.
"Because we know folks will work hard, they'll save and pay that monthly mortgage."
Why aren't you inviting us to these things?
"So it really is a flip-flopping county that historically was bluer, but has gotten much redder over time and is a place where manufacturing is very strong."
"In Congress, he's proven that he will stand up to corporate price gadget and work to lower costs for families."
Are you going to frame it?
"In today's time, I'm almost afraid to admit that because people look at you like you're crazy because everything is so divided."
"And this just shows you that Trump is opening up the economy and helping jobs, man, all time high when he was in office."
"Because again, whether you look at our polls or others, you know, we could run the same poll and show Harris maybe even or plus one."
"And so it does seem like people always ask me one of the most biggest questions I get is, what do you think about the election?"
What we were saying when she made the pick was do no harm.
"I mean, I've had a lot of exposure with candidates running for Congress, running for the Senate, and they're really concerned about the direction for my generation and our future, because ultimately the decisions that policymakers make now are going to be what we have to deal with down the line."
"Remember Keith Oldman had this show on MSNBC, the worst person in the world."
Appreciate it.
But you do see the politics of disaster relief.
Astronaut and a fighter pilot.
Hubert Humphrey is somebody known as the happy warrior back in the day.
Forty seven versus six for Harris.
"But what's also like things that we have seen is the new 538 forecast, and I did want to touch base on this as well because this is 538, and Donald Trump is up in the polls in every single swing state."
"So late yesterday, Speaker Johnson unveiled new plans for Ford aid, suggesting separating them into separate bills."

"18-year-old Jamel Garcia, a student at the Brothers Barbershop, says he'll vote for the first time."
This stark contrast between the two political figures is hard to ignore.
But it's so fantastic to be here in the city where the Constitution was actually written.
They take in the geese.
That bill was for 180 police officers to patrol inside and outside the TCC Center for six and a half hours.
"The first question came from ABC's Scott, who asked about Trump's past incendiary rhetoric towards women of color."
"In fact, many of the candidates Trump has endorsed shouted from the rooftops, all looking to grab the MAGA vote."

"That's how much they like Donald Trump and these, they're going to be in the line."

We know that former President Donald Trump won this state back in 2016.
Catherine I want to kind of continue a little bit you mentioned the blue wall and particularly mentioned my favorite state of Pennsylvania.
Let's go ahead and take a listen to this.

But look at polls that have come out over the last week or so and what do we see?

The campaign has not provided any other specifics other than to say it believes it was hacked by some Iranian entity and cited a report that was released on Friday by Microsoft warning that Iranian-backed entities or Iranian-based entities had been doing or attempting to do these kinds of things.
"My great friend, Polish president, Andrzej Duda, is at the National Shrine of Our Lady of Tosto Hova in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, to honor and remember the brave heroes who fought for Poland's independence after World War II."
Because we know what he did the first time didn't work.
So they've got a bargaining chip.
"That said, we can win anyway by understanding what their intention is and doing our best to overwhelm the polls with our presence."
The former first lady has been working behind the scenes to boost Harris and they're expected to have her appear on the campaign trail but it hasn't happened yet.
"It's one of the reasons why Gretchen Whitmer, Tony Evers, and I are doing this blue wall bus tour over the course of the next week or so."
"I don't really know them, but I would look very closely at the words because they all have meaning words are powerful songs are powerful."

"Harris has energized Democratic voters, with 65 percent expressing at least some enthusiasm about voting for her, compared to 68 percent of Trump supporters."
I don't see Kamala bringing this.
"So if America falls, what's going to happen to the whole world?"
That's why it's not good for Democrats that they're way behind where they should be.
"I know that Trump isn't my choice, and I am still watching and waiting and very hopeful as Vice President Harris keeps moving to the center."
"And if Biden and Biden won by four, but he was up eight four years ago, ergo, the polling was left by about four points."
"But Ruben and I were talking to a remarkable group of men right before we came out and we were talking about this and somebody said, man, I'm just so tired of everybody being divided and mean and nasty."
"The other thing that's happening is that people who are making commentary about a potential motive, they're mostly political commentators, so they are looking for a political motive."

We shouldn't let anybody walk through into our country.
But we're also seeing Harris trying to reach people in various ways.
"Haha, that was a great one buddy."
"Yeah, you know, it's hard to say."
"How is the Democratic Party situated with Kamala Harris at the top to prosecute the case that her candidacy for the presidency is not just necessary because of the opponent that she's running against, but because of standing in the breach on behalf of people will make a difference for them when it matters in 26, 27, and 28."
That would give Trump a win.
"It's actually much better because everyone gets the Congressional Medal of Honor that soldiers, they're either in very bad shape because they've been hit so many times by bullets or they're dead."

"I mean, we've seen it when he was talking about the former senator."
"Speaking to the crowd at Butler, Elon Musk said that only Donald Trump could save democracy in America."
But what if that isn't the case?
It all comes into play.
"It's just within that region, the places that are Republican are becoming more Republican, and the places that are Democratic are becoming more Democratic."
We don't even have evidence to suggest that is true yet.
"Look, you should be really prepared to look at a serious fine or be charged with a crime and they need to pay the price."

"And while I certainly do not believe it will be enough for an electoral college landslide, it will be enough for an electoral college victory if this momentum maintains itself."

Black men are no different from anybody else.

"We are going to be looking at the numbers in Pennsylvania, not just some of the polling numbers."
America doesn't want to go back.
Give me a freaking break.
"Let's bring in founder of bikers for Trump, Chris Cox."
She has plenty of resources to be able to communicate her message.
People are driving for hours.
So I take it real seriously.
So I could very well be one of those childless women.
Have a wonderful rest of your morning.
Critical state.

Leading Harris 51% to 41% in terms of voter trust on this critical matter.
"And even though she wasn't, she just has no ties at all."
We don't let anybody just walk through our homes.
I wonder if the Trump campaign has responded to the vice president's use of his own words at her rallies to rally voters to her cause.
"For example, back in 2020 and roughly the same time period, you know, the middle of October, it was Biden plus seven, plus seven, plus six, plus five, plus four, when he won by a point."
"Given the narrow margin in Pennsylvania, both candidates will need to intensify their campaign efforts in the state."
"Like if you own a computer, you're always going to have to be upgrading the parts and stuff, but you upgrade it when you want to upgrade it."

"They say to me in my show, why would he stand up after getting shot at?"
"They want to support a president who understands that we have to end mass shooting at schools, but also holds accountable a government that decimated every university across Gaza."
"There's still, I've heard no explanation for why liberals don't want that act."
Hear me when I say.
"But still, you know, is it really going to be enough?"
It was by the thinnest of margins.
"For example, while when Joe Biden was still in, the anticipation was that the Democrats would lose the Southern Rim, which meant then that Joe Biden would have to win all three of the Northern Wall and then pick up two more electoral votes, one in Nebraska and one in Maine."
The speech that I'm showing you took place on Friday evening.

And swing this week.
I think it's completely insane.

"While each state has its unique political dynamics, they all share a history of being fiercely contested battlegrounds."
"Concrete plans, that's who Kamala is."
"Look, this is a state where the economy is usually the centerpiece of the argument in both presidential races and Senate races."

Presidential debates and presidentials or anything.
She has a good track record.

Big margins in the suburbs that surround Philadelphia are critical for Democrats.

"If you're just joining us, former President Donald Trump has been shot."

He got he got guts and he's not scared.
"I mean, you know, it's just like insider advantage was really good in 2020."

They wanted Mike to caucus to pick him an idiot.
"And even just at late this afternoon, District Attorney Fadi Willis filed to get the charges against former President Trump restated in the 2020 election interference case, you may recall earlier this spring, a series of charges, about six charges were thrown out against the former president and five of his co-defendants."

So he's going to continue to visit Pennsylvania to make that case to the American people.
"Democrats added only 17,000."
"So, Bartolotta took to social media."
Incredibly strong and incredibly fragile.
She sort of stepped up.
We need him.
I think Kamala Harris has the momentum and is moving in the right direction and showing signs that she clearly understands how to campaign in our Commonwealth.
"But I mean, I don't know how true this is, but I look, me personally, I think Trump's probably going to get somewhere around 14% of the black vote."
Five point three point average error and R plus 3.8 in terms of their bias.
So I think she has to articulate that tonight.

"Thank you, Pennsylvania."
I don't know that you could really argue that Donald Trump is.
They have and how how dishonest was ABC?

A Republican's not going to win a campaign in California.
We were just talking about Trump's value in a Republican primary with the broader electorate.
"The former president was, you may see this better than me from the footage, removed by a Secret Service detail that seemed to pounce immediately."
And that's when you start hearing about zombie voters.
"The less Biden there is, the better off she's going to be."
He was personally insulting her.
The only reason he didn't get a lot more done is because they gave him grief every minute of every day.
Why'd she leave so suddenly?
"Don't say that, you stupid son of a bitch."
"The Harris campaign has added an issues tab on the campaign website, but I wonder what you think about this perception from voters."

Immigration.
Would you be doing that if it wasn't for the events of last time?
He's white and Republican and they're going to protect him somehow.
"You have the Democratic Attorney General, Josh Shapiro, up against the state senator, Doug Mastriano."
So at least in 2020 Quinnipiac very much not overestimated Biden support a little bit.
And I think that will resonate with voters across the spectrum here in Pennsylvania.
"Now Trump appears to be having momentum with many polls moving in his direction, but one state could be make or break for both campaigns, both candidates."
None of it affected him.
It's too strong.
That's huge Absolutely massive.
So this would be a Harris zero point five.
It's almost like this echo chamber isn't tight enough to keep these people over here in the MSNBC column contained.
And I'm not entirely sure Dr. Oz does that and the guy's got a lot of controversial statements in his past surrounding a wide variety of things.
"But you still find a lot of people who may not be viewing these ads and these promotions saying, what are her policies?"

I'm going to share some photos and possibly some videos here.

"And most polling down here in Miami-Dade County shows that Latinos are choosing Trump over Harris, which is why the Harris campaign has been trying to get out this message to Latino voters, sort of reminding them in a way about the immigration policies that former President Trump had, but also trying to get the message of what they would do when it comes to the economy, which is a key issue for this voting work."
"In contrast to what he considers to be the failure of the Republican Party to protect basic freedoms in their current form, he highlighted marriage equality, religious freedom, and union rights and public safety as areas in which Democrats have been defending fundamental liberties."

"They have not agreed to that yet, so there's no formal agreement in place."
"While Donald Trump on the other hand, who's seen as someone who's very business friendly, has managed to generate a watch list of just about 300 plus million dollars."

" Tomorrow night's presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will take place in Philadelphia, in a state that could prove to be the deciding factor in the race for the White House."
"Like these are what you know, these are just, you know, brand these as being, you know, just American mainstream positions for public education, for public schools."
It's a 13 times uptake than what it's normally seen.
"The three states to keep an eye on out of this are North Carolina, where Harris has a narrow lead over Trump by about two points, and then, of course, Arizona, where Harris is up by five, that New York Times-Ciena College poll shows, and then Nevada, where it's got Trump up by a few points."
"No, I just wanted to see if we can get those bigger."
4.
"They really shot Trump and they missed, failed."
So you are really losing people and leaving them behind at the wayside.
"Yeah, so I mean, after 2016, Trump really starts to lose the suburban vote, especially the suburban women vote."
Does she need to introduce that to voters?
I don't see Joe Biden bringing this.
And pretend to be somebody that they're not.
"Are you thinking about this and the other assaults on reproductive freedom, including in vitro fertilization, which is a way that many people are starting their families now?"
"However, in the 2020 US presidential election, Joe Biden won the electoral votes in Pennsylvania with 1.17% more votes than Trump."
"And no, I'm not gonna mention any names."
"Cracking 50, cracking 50, cracking 50 for multiple reasons."
"Inflation, crime, and illegal immigration."
"As a matter of fact, very little of the polling numbers."
Donald Trump was at a rally in Pennsylvania.
They are happy.
"You know, things over my career, we were lucky."
"So the cops, cops are usually on our side considering that Trump affects the blues."
"One of division, chaos, and conspiracy theories, and one of progress, inclusivity, and real solutions."
"Yes, I do."
This is really the first time in a while he's been meaningfully leaning in Pennsylvania.
I want to be heard.
Bye.
"If you like it or not, he's the energy you had with Barack."
"This man was allowed to set up for a full 10 minutes, get five shots out before they caught him."

"Ozzy Pabara, thank you so much."
She needs to win in the fall.
"And as I said, show me the data."
"There's 150,000, 146,000 independent votes for Johnson."
"Elon Musk with all of his money fighting, quote, censorship in his public personality for the last year plus, teasing that he wouldn't endorse someone and then all of a sudden after the primary ends, he took such an opposition to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris that he felt the need to get involved."
"So they decided to stand down and stand by, so to speak."
But he has that background.
"I got to tell you, I've heard voters for Trump."
The three questioning the former president's character in ethics calling on Republicans to choose country over party and truth over lies.
"If we assume Trump is up in Pennsylvania again, this is a hypothetical."
We see the Trump campaign focusing on a Harris county that is just so densely populated that getting a small bump in the percentage there could make the difference in Pennsylvania.
Every single one of them and most of them are shifting four to five points towards Trump.
"Whereas the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to my knowledge, I don't think anybody suffered other than they've, you know, they've worked hard and they've done great things."
I think he's been a fantastic President.
"And of course, Vice President Kamala Harris denounced some of that as well."
"Can't do that yet, even though they're trying hard to do that."
"Well, what did Kamala Harris do Saturday night in Las Vegas, but say I support ending taxes on tips, as well as raising the minimum wage for workers who have those lower minimum wage levels of roughly $2 in change in some states, definitely below the federal average, because your employer is presuming that you're going to make a lot more in terms of tipped wages as well."
So I was making the point there to South Carolinians that they played an important role in elevating Joe Biden.
"Well, they think because they're trying."
"And Dan, what does that rally tell you about where Democrats and their candidates are today versus where they were just three months, three weeks and a day ago before Joe Biden stepped aside?"
"In all honesty, how much stock should we really give to polls in general, given how unreliable they've been when measuring the Trump effect, let's just say?"
"Alrighty, let's start with the upper Rust Belt Quartet of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania."
They're not necessarily pounding the national numbers as hard.
People who are moving here are from all over the country.
"We're tired of the perpetual war I'm more legal immigrants Tired tired of the immigrants tired of those prices, but I need them then don't go down now You guys are younger gentlemen, is that the biggest issue that you guys are facing guys kind of Gen Z voters here?"
"Yes, some of them are mad about my clothes."
I think Eastern Pennsylvania.
Maybe we talked about getting Riley Moore one.
Duncan was forced to do this in order to support Harris.
"Asma, let's switch gears here."
"I think anyone who decides to become a teacher, it's just, it's one of the greatest gifts that one has that they give."
So this could be a down ballot situation.
"John Delano, politics editor with CBS News Pittsburgh, spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris about the top issues for the Keystone State voters, including her stance on the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by the Japanese company Nippon Steel."
"Now, with Harris carrying the Democratic torch and Trump eyeing a comeback, Pennsylvania is once again in the spotlight."
"And a state where more than six million votes will be cast this fall, perhaps exceeding 10,000."
So we're just a couple of weeks out from the Democratic National Convention.
"Now all of their cross tabs and you also look at the favorability for Kamala Harris, it's going down again."
And the secret surface said the two other attendees are critically injured.
And what you see nationally is Kamala Harris with a 1.6 percent lead.
"Senator Bob Casey, of course, is running for reelection in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
She tied you to her kitchen chair.
The question is deployed very strategically by the right in this country.
Not now not ever Former President Trump has led this onslaught of lies Assertions have been made that properties being confiscated It's simply not true They're saying people impacted by these storms will receive $750 in cash and no more that is simply not true either They're saying that money needed for these crises are being diverted to migrants.
"But during a late night press briefing, a spokesperson for the FBI said it was a secret service that would have to answer questions as to what the FBI was doing and how it would have to be done."
Those are some of those boxes.
We have the lowest unemployment rate in the country.
So you know when you're looking at economic policy when you're looking at foreign policy that certainly played out over this last year on Ukraine where even without a Trump presidency Trump had a lot of influence in the discussions among the Republican Conference the influence of the Freedom Caucus.
"You don't want to be up by three and on top of that insider advantage, which is a good pollster."
"And I suspect that if the Harris campaign is successful at moving the needle on the issue, that that's the number to watch."
"So they went to the Secret Service, they found out it was all bullshit."
"Hey there, Caitlin."
It's difficult to believe.
"I mean, these are states that are demographically and economically similar."
Is anyone there?
Burn fat and feel more energized than they have in years.
Because there is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody but himself.
"And you're seeing more and more enthusiasm and you see it show up at these neighborhood offices that Kamala Harris has put in place where they're showing up not just to take a shift, but also showing up and saying, hey, listen, I'm not a registered Democrat, but I still want to be part of this campaign."
"In the meantime, they can't afford their groceries."
"On the other hand, the message that Donald Trump was talking about today was thousands of people were turned away from the courthouse in lower Manhattan."
"And now if when she takes her dog for a walk, she has to stay inside of the building so that she can call for help if need be."
"Can you imagine if, if I did that, can you imagine if Reuben did that right in the middle?"
"I've noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior of bullying and of putting people down is a sign of strength."
"And sometimes I didn't live up to those values and I made mistakes, and I tried to learn from them."
Her campaign is trying to appeal to rural Democrats to try to offset any gains Trump would make in those rural Republican heavy counties.
And how many of you plan on supporting Donald Trump this November?
"In the video yesterday and too many stages that comment that I've seen online, there are so many people talking about how this is staged."
"The US Secret Service had sprung into action to save him, to cover him."
And I'll tell you why that is because he's not being honest with himself every day.
I want to thank you all for watching again of course you can like and subscribe to our channel.
I'm hearing something totally different.
That was about eight points or so maybe got up to nine it was about eight points after the debate.
So why are Gen Z voters so important this year?
Her donation reflects her support for Harris' efforts to expand healthcare access and improve the quality of care for all Americans.
Where does the race stand here?
"But a vote for Kamala Harris, what's her party bringing you?"
"She's been in the party 62 years and does not mince words about Trump, noting he's a convicted felon or about Trump voters."
"Kristen, thanks for joining us today."
How'd Joe Biden do?
There are more of us than there are of them.
"By the same time, these are so close that it's hard to really put stock in anything being more than a hunch."
We'll continue that trip planning ahead of the presidential election.
A little closer than other people.
So this is like dead heat in a lot of these polls.
All the information's on there.
Like when I'm not exaggerating when I say this is Def Con one for Dems.
I've all but said that across the board.
"Fellow Americans of mine, please don't forget we have a big election coming up on November the 5th, so if you are eligible to vote, if you are intending to vote, if it's possible for you to vote, please double-check your voter registration before election day, and if you can do more than vote, by all means please do more, but at the very least on November the 5th."
Their oversampling did show that Donald Trump's in a position to win a considerable share of the black vote compared to previous Republican candidates but also that's at the trade-off of losing and losing ground with white voters.
They will get him to the hospital.
Everyone gets really excited for these.
So here's the headline Quinnipiac poll September 18th.
He called himself the father of IVF.
They are earth shattering.
"But now it's, it's a harder call just because I am not a fan of Donald Trump."
The thirteenth poll was conducted between October 7 and 10 by the New York Times Siena College among 857 likely voters.
1400 days you don't get another 1460 days on the other hand you had President Biden holding a very serious press conference today But of course the media asks him some of the dumbest questions here play this clip.
There is not.
Biden did.
They released one clip about that from that interview.
I mean the red wave is imminent.
We're in a customization.
"All you do when you go vote is they'll ask you, do you want a Democratic ballot or Republican win?"
"Yeah, stay home."
It's not about the country.
Beautiful hat right there.
We got to witness firsthand what actually went on.
"Now, I will tell you how he protected you, quote, unquote."
"And I even think The New York Times, they claim that the electorate is only like 60 percent white in Pennsylvania, which is just crazy."
These poll results highlight a tight race between Trump and Harris in Pennsylvania.
Now this group is run by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.
"Of course, you're going to be looking for the things that make you look good and the candidate you oppose bad."
He's leading the polls in Quinnipiac.
"OK, now it's a Harris point eight."
"Missed it entirely in Philadelphia, Detroit, and other key cities where black turnout in general was lower than it had been for President Obama and black men specifically."
And he's always been my man.
So this this is huge stuff.
So who do I trust more?
"And look, I actually want to admit that I was wrong about something."
"I have friends that are still trying to have children and that are at an age maybe where they do need, say, IVF, or they could have problemsome pregnancies and their life could be on the line because a judge or a lawmaker wants to make that decision for them."
"But if you just look point by point, data point by data point, it's Democrats who are making sure kids are getting fed."
I have.
You've got to convince a prosecutor in a court.
"That tells me that she understands, yeah, it's going to be hard to get that last yard and a half, but she's doing the right things to be able to do that."
"I'm saying, my God, the number of weird things that have happened in this election, I don't think that we've actually had that number of strange things happen in any other election, maybe in US history."
And that's probably in huge part because she respects the president.
Is this how you picture Donald Trump?
"You know, I'm still the same person I was before I put that information out."
They have House members who really support aid to Israel.
Suburban voters have been a critical swing group in recent elections.
That's what it was spun as as listen to the clip a million times.
"Hate to use the word, but that's what I'm seeing."
"As I said, mention the economy, immigration."
Fair enough.
Harris wins 90 percent to 9 percent among MSNBC viewers.
"These areas have seen a shift in voter sentiment, especially among women and college-educated voters who have increasingly moved away from traditional Republican support."
Pennsylvania is particularly divided between different voter groups in different regions.
"He said to me, the Trump campaign has an explanation."
And I'll be waiting for that.
"But these numbers are very, very good for Republicans."
"And I think that's what we saw tonight, especially with that question."
It's not just one poll that that's part of a trend.
"Pennsylvania, the battleground."
"As both campaigns make their final push, the outcome in Pennsylvania will likely be decided by a combination of voter turnout, enthusiasm, and how each candidate navigates the key issues like the economy, fracking, and the future of democracy."
I'm excited for Kamala.
Is the danger any different when a king would rush straight into a bunch of men with spears?
"This one's in Oaks, Pennsylvania."
"A lot of times with voters, the emotional appeal tends to be a little more persuasive because that's where humans... we have emotions and we appeal to it."
"Rosemary Atardo says, my thoughts exactly, President Trump will not stop fighting for the people of this country."
This was after an abysmal debate performance.
"If you send Reuben Gayle to the Senate, he'll vote to restore the reproductive freedom the women had for nearly 50 years."
"Yeah, I'd support her over the other candidates in the race."
"I mean, they're seeing on they're talking about this."
Here's more.
You're going to be in trouble.
"Maybe we should, I don't know, bring back a little bit more YMCA."
" So, earlier this week, we traveled to Pennsylvania as part of our tour for survey and fact-finding on the supporters and donors working toward the actualization of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz's presidential victory."
Harris finished 2 points ahead of Trump in this poll.
"Unsurprisingly, Trump is leading Harris among men, 54-44, while Harris is leading Trump among women, 55-43."
This is kind of out left field that everybody else is attached to a major news media organization or is using their own proprietary panel like Reuters and Ipsos.
Will Pennsylvania go red or blue this time?
He's like we don't want any more debates He's saying I've already done two there's not gonna be a third because he's counting the first one with Biden what changed Now Trump's answer on this is really twofold one He says he already won the debate.
"In this case, Republicans happens all the time, all the time."
Our elections last forever.
"And he's with Harris today, right?"
Two people familiar with this said that she has expressed fresh concerns about security following two assassination attempts against Trump.
We've got folks in rural communities in Pennsylvania who are now getting the high speed Internet turned on for the first time because of our partnership with the Biden-Harris administration.
In the latest polls.
There's been no comment otherwise from government entities about this.
"Mental health counselors in our schools to make sure our kids' mental health is taken care of, which is just as important as our physical health."
Or is this based on what you're just recently saying that it really doesn't matter for Donald Trump?
"I mean, when you watch this, you're just like this is some of the most vile, weird, just weird filth that's out there here."
"Remember when Biden used, I used to love this guy because you were on pins and needles watching him speak."
It depends on us.
We heard Trump talk about many of the themes that he's touched on over the years.
We're here to support our President Donald Trump.
I think they're definitely more than just noise.
I need to see where that man laid on that roof and decided that it was a good idea to just shoot into that crowd and maybe getting some answers.
"Remember, it was he who packed the Supreme Court so that they would overturn Roe v. Wade and it was he who ran to the microphones to claim credit for it."
Thank you a little bit more about why decided to come out.
That's not going to happen.
We need to talk about that enough.
"You know, the Biden campaign has been very clear that they want these Haley supporters."
We were accepted with love.
In others it was very unique.
This is communist.
"Except for one poll, he's at 48, 49, and 50% of the vote."
"44%, yeah, 44%."
"And if Donald came back, I know it's safer, you know?"
"To get their take on this election, Melissa and I sat down with a group of intergenerational black women who live in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, an area critical to Democrats and Republicans in this election."
"Donald Trump, on the other hand, urged Republicans not to support it."
That's why it's good news across the board when it comes to voter registration.
That's our mayor McCutchey's.
And Pennsylvania is actually one of six states where you have a Democrat and a Republican represented in the U.S. Senate.
Kamala Harris make major improvements relative to President Biden.
"I agree, but it's a little bit more complicated."
Kamala Harris tweeting in response to this with the video.
"And not only that, Trump's at 48%."
This emotionally significant visit fostered connections with grieving families.
I just know I want him to get in and I don't want Camilla in.
All three states had been Democratic strongholds before Trump turned them red on his path to winning the presidency in 2016.
He could stop any war.
"So the question is, what's going on?"
"Thank you, Robert."
It's a double standard that these people have.
"And if you look at Pennsylvania politically, you know, Democrats did very well there in 2022, in part because Republicans had sort of like uniquely poor candidates in Dr. Oz and what's the other dude's name who ran for governor?"
This is the presidential and let me show you the issues and the way that Donald Trump has an advantage for people who say both the economy and the border.
The margin of error in our CBS News polling is 2.3 points.
You're screwed.
"But what I do think is that they are a bit indicative of where we can see, because the crosstabs from poll to poll may not be the best science, but it does provide additional context."
Thank you very much.
Like I ran or something?
But I think that y I look at gas prices beca on that.
I'll do it again.
"Also, have you ever met another person who doesn't know what kind of donut they like?"
"But at the same time, I think that that Trump's support for Oz is very, very, very a huge thing for the Oz campaign."
"Taking shots at the Republican presidential nominee, the former president called Donald Trump a whiny old billionaire who is obsessed with himself."
"Even in North Carolina, I think you underperformed his 538 polling aggregate on election day by about 0.2, which is not a serious amount."
"Yeah, there are undecided voters still."
Did the events of what happened here last inspire you that you want to be here today?
"You know, who knows about anything today, but I think it's a good future."
"I think this goes to the question, though."
And so I just want to start off by getting your reaction to this pick.
I mean it's scary to think about at this point but I'm feeling more hopeful than I have in a long time.
I know what it requires and you're going to be outstanding.
"You're not Donald Trump, but nothing comes to mind that you would do differently."
There was a secret accord.
More and more people started to dislike Kamala Harris.
" The streets so cold, stories untold From the hoods we are foes And master in control, bringin' truth to the light Join the live show, every dark hood, every night Gotta catch live when the truth gets revealed From coast to coast, we bringin' stories that's real Send master on the mic, don't miss a beat True crime tales from the heart of the streets Yo, you yo, welcome to Guttercast We keep it real and raw, where the streets of Chi-town Leave you at all, from Compton's blocks To Detroit's gritty grind, Baltimore's corners Where the sun barely shines, we talkin' New Orleans nights Where the sirens scream, that lays back alleys Livin' the nightmare dream True crime tales from the heart of the beast From the east to the west, we gon' keep it unleashed Gotta catch, we reppin' the streets so cold Stories untold, from the hoods we are foes Send master in control, bringin' truth to the light Join the live show, every dark hood, every night Gotta catch live when the truth gets revealed From coast to coast, we bringin' stories that's real Send master on the mic, don't miss a beat Send master on the Sunday afternoon, 77 degrees Here in Portland at 152 In the PM, it's your man, the OG, triple OG Quadruple, triple OG Your boys and master Coming to y'all today Let's get a little background music, shall we?"
"Together, Harris and Walz present a powerful combination of experience, perspective, and vision."
"Yeah, in the last few weeks, we've had several Democratic strategists and several Democrats who were hoping to vote for Kamala Harris, but every time we talk to them, they say they just need to know more."
"When Joe Biden dropped out of the race, he was losing nationally by roughly three points."
"But today in Georgia, the Trump campaign, definitely hoping he stays on message trying to court those suburban women voters."
"If you're a Republican, there would have to be a crazy deviation that we haven't seen in over two decades for it to signal a Harris victory because if she wins the popular vote by a point, she's not winning the electoral college even with the recent shifts we're going to that we've seen in New York and possibly Illinois and California and Florida and all of those states are getting more conservative."
"So the gunman was unalived, you know, taken away from the scene."
Trump held a massive 36-point advantage over Biden in rural areas.
"And for more on Walz, I want to bring in CBS News campaign reporter Hunter Woodell."
"Remember, it was he who packed the Supreme Court so that they would overturn Roe v. Wade, and it was he who ran to the microphones to claim credit for it."
"Rich people are given $7,000 subsidies to buy luxury electric."
Tim Walz is an outstanding governor.
Just at time of publishing Donald Trump leading now in the Quinnipiac poll.
Trump can use the ruling to emphasize that his campaign is fighting for the principles he has championed throughout his political career.
He's really sticking it to them.
I've been skating for decades.
That's going to be her response.
I think he was already the president for four years.
That's at least a five point swing.
"Trump's return to Pennsylvania follows an assassination attempt, demonstrating his resilience and dedication to the campaign as he aims to reclaim the presidency this November."
"Look, I know Donald Trump doesn't have anything to do other than campaigning."
"He really needs to rally the troops there, which is why he's spending so much time there, acting like a populist, talking about Donald Trump, how Donald Trump wants to please only the wealthy."
"A strong criticism targeted Kamala Harris, suggesting she is unfit for her role and highlighting past controversies, reinforcing the argument against her political credibility."
"Every time there's a new update, it gets even worse for Democrats like okay fine."
And they are shitty pollsters like Bloomberg.
The result is an homage to the franchise while simultaneously moving the story for later.
That has been rejected.
The Trump campaign is going to try and get those rural voters that he has such tremendous success without.
"If you look at younger voters, the gender gap has very much widened."
"The crowd was, it was the largest crowd I've ever spoken before."
"We have gotten that down from 90%, so let's keep going and try to get that down to 50-50 by election day."
And that's where we were with Biden as the nominee on the day he dropped out.
"In November of 2020, Democrats had a 685,000 voter registration advantage in Pennsylvania."
"But look, I think as as people go forward and begin to really deliberate about this election, I think they're seeing that difference."
"Now we go to the average on real clear politics where Kamala Harris, thanks to this Quinnipiac poll, has now actually taken a lead in the Pennsylvania average, up to 0.6 percent now."
I'm a lawyer.
Juicy.
"Anthony, this isn't the first poll in recent weeks to show that the two candidates are neck and neck in Pennsylvania, which is considered perhaps the most coveted battleground in this year's election."
We're not reinventing it.
CBS News is reporting Governor Shapiro is among those finalists.
"Reporting live outside the Butler Farm show, Jennifer Barasso, Katie K. TV News."
"He's been a great governor, working with Democrats and Republicans to get stuff done."
And my question to people is why do they believe that Donald Trump is incapable of making up 1% ground when he's going up against a candidate that is not all that good of a fit for Pennsylvania?
Trump finished two points ahead of Harris in this poll.
And so I think what you see here are some of the same things you see elsewhere.
Let's get an idea of how big a crowd is.
"Thank you so much for joining us, Congressman."
"And look, Erie's also had some economic challenges over the last several years."
"Who specifically, which demographic is she trying to win over there?"
"As we are seeing right now, Democrats are in a good trend of hitting that firewall number."
"In the last 50, 60 years, and now that Kissinger is dead, he's the worst, this is saying that it was equating with Darth Vader."
Pennsylvania is the swingiest swing state in the history of swing states.
"Thank you, sir."
You said that this is county who's been trending blue over the years.
And even the New York Times could only pull a Harris plus one.
What would you fear most about a Kamala Harris administration?
But do you understand that that's detached from goddamn reality?
"In Wisconsin, there was a lot of it though."
Our love is not a victory March.
Why do we need that in this country?
"So immediately brought together our communications team to begin through social media platforms, assuring the rest of the world whose eyes were on Pennsylvania that our vote counting was going to continue."
"I know things can change but does this really look like an enthusiasm surge when the mail-in requests, they're trending Republican the total requests are weighed down and Republicans just raw vote wise they're they're up compared to 2022 while Democrats they're going to be above their numbers from 22."
Oh my gosh I'm so excited.
You could not make this stuff up.
Are they even worth paying attention to or are they just going to make us more anxious?
The former president has been shocked.
"Erin McClelland, a candidate for treasurer, endorsed North Carolina Gov."
"Right now, if you want to know whether not only, not only whether families are better, but the entire United States is better."
That's why we're seeing so much attention on this one state.
I don't really I don't know the ins and outs.
Puerto Rican voters are largely concentrated in central Florida.
But you know what I mean?
President Obama headlined a rally in Pittsburgh tonight.
"Now, if it is in fact the tipping point state, is there any elected official in Pennsylvania who may have been on a ticket that might have made a difference?"
"Because part of it makes me think, not speaking to men directly, part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as President."
So they were counting them throughout the day.
"By ensuring that mail-in ballots are subject to strict requirements, the ruling may reduce the number of ballots that could otherwise be counted for democratic candidates."
But nope.
But this is not complicated.
"The party numbers again, time and time again, there is zero crossover advantage."
Latinos are looking for a leader who will fight for them and the issues that their families care about.
I'm sometimes frustrated with politics.
This is Trump's hood guys.
They will get him.
Yet two outliers are causing this Paris lead in quotation.
"So I had Ian on the show ask me, he's like, why would Donald Trump stand up after getting shot at?"
"On the other hand, here's Governor Walz."
But here are some of the comments.
That's where the Biden Harris administration has been.
"The New York Times' Siena College Polls surveyed 2,670 likely voters with varying margins of error across the states."
"First off we have starting here, does Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirms Cornel West will not appear on state ballots?"
Let me know if you agree or not But it's so wild to hear him mention the cia man like We know uh speaking of real or fake.
"Yeah, I was a middle class kid."
"If you're astrology, the birth canal, what was that?"
Our polling has it pretty much even here.
I just don't feel like doing it right now.
It's all fake.
"The Ukraine war, the conflict in Ukraine and U.S. involvement in supporting the country, have become key foreign policy issues."
Likely voters now see little daylight in most cases between Harris and Trump on who can best handle those key issues.
"And I don't even think Harris is really that strong of a candidate when it comes to these like, you know, millennial men, for example, which, you know, typically when they grow up as well, they're going to be, you could argue, moving to the right."
"Over the last couple of years, my friends and I have shared concerns over the economy."
I do hope we'll talk again.
"They complain that they've been left out of events, and surrogates haven't even been deployed effectively, and they've urged Harris, in private meetings, to do more to turn out voters of color."
"Oh, I thought it was coming from the necklace."
You will not regret it.
"He put his money on Wisconsin, rallying voters there."
"In today's final poll, on the same which was also conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, with different with 693 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 44%, and Trump lost the poll by two points."

I actually don't.
"Well, if they'd all been properly vetted, that probably wouldn't have happened."
"She basically said that they were all talk, no action."
"Last week, the 44th President of America gave a blistering performance in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."
"You've made Wilkes-Barre, you've made Luzerne County very proud, Kelly Meyer."
They're buying them with credit cards.
It is real bad.
Hit that notification bell and smack the like button because it helps us with the algorithm.
Two people ended up fainting.
One's a midterm election.
"And I'll tell you, every Tuesday, you will see us at Roots Country Market in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the major hub of the Amish."
So you're getting this back and forth as to whether or not those mics will be on.
They're not going to let you or anybody else frack.
This is in Pennsylvania in the middle of October.
"But you rather Trump than Harris, huh?"
A shockwave was sent through our energy industry with the Biden-Harris administration immediately upon shutting down the Keystone XL.
"Mercer said, quote, Republican leadership in North Carolina is tested and has proven to have a superior ground game."
And she now claims to love fracking out of nowhere was.
"It's possible that people that already voted just stopped answering the polls, but we didn't see the same thing in 2020."
Think back to Super Storm Sandy in 2012 and the closing days of that presidential election.
What does it say about the state of this race that this is the tack that he's taking now?
Got one of my favorites.
I've got some shit that I've got to get to.
This is post-conviction.
"And it's not because I love the man, but I like his policies a lot better."
I don't think anyone should be able to deny that he cares about America so much.
That's why.
And it has gotten redder.
I don't think he should have had to transfer power at all.
"I always you know, I should know better because I live in Philadelphia I always sort of mess up Wilkes-Barre or Wilkes-Barre, but I'm sure that you can probably correct me What's the what's the significance of this location?"
If you're in business and and somebody you're doing business with just outright lies and manipulates you stop doing business with.
It does not happen in this year.
We really appreciate it.
"We have a Senate race, which frankly could decide the balance of power in the United States Senate right here."
We did not hear a lot about his policy proposals or what he is saying he would do right now.
Obama's been out there scolding black men.
And that's because she really believes in sparking growth among small businesses in this country.
He was just saved by an inches.
"Here, play the clip."
I'll tell y'all that look at all these people here.
"Real quick, Medigys changed their algorithm to suppress political content."
"Now the latest poll here in Texas from Public Policy Polling surveyed on August 21st and 22nd has Trump up 5 points among 725 registered voters, 49% to 44%."
"In recent elections, Pennsylvania has been decided by razor-thin margins."
"They're off by three points, which is very possible, considering you have garbage pollsters like Bloomberg finding Harris plus five."
"It seems like basic, conservative, common sense to me."
"I think it'd be more likely that if this poll is correct, it'd be more like 51 49 for Trump, for Harris, excuse me, in Pennsylvania, where Trump gets up to 49 and Harris wins by two."
"Vice president Dick Cheney, his daughter, Congresswoman Liz Cheney, just yesterday, the former Bush attorney general, Alberto Gonzalez, endorsing her candidacy."
So let me go to our telestrator here because we have a map of that location.
Take a look at this when it comes to election integrity.
"Philadelphia, what are they going to do?"
"And the day Donald Trump took over the Republican Party, they abdicated the ability to be able to speak to those issues in any kind of meaningful way."
I wouldn't necessarily say that.
"In today's final poll, also conducted by SoCal Strategies on the same date with 713 likely voters, Harris received 47% of the vote, while Trump received 48%."
"Clearly, the voters here in Pennsylvania didn't share those concerns when they elected Josh Shapiro in a landslide as our governor."
"The farmers are doing very badly right now, very, very badly under this administration."
"Subscribing to my channel analytics page, more than 80% of my viewers are not subscribed."
People want to be inspired to vote for something.
That's all that matters.
"Hello, everyone."
"Remember at the DNC, he spoke first instead of speaking his ass."
"And the shots that are being taken from both sides, you know, a Republican or Democrat."
"So here tonight, I will show you one example of Donald Trump's worldview and intentions."
That's where the unfavorable numbers on the Biden presidency are really coming from.
"What we're seeing in a lot of these primaries is a test of how far the simple backing of Donald Trump will carry you, whatever your past record happens to be."
CBS News campaign reporter Aaron Navarro is joining us now with more on the Harris team's movements.
"That's not good news, but the more important takeaway is the battleground states because they pulled voters from battleground states and what did they exactly find?"
"Obama completely trashed him on that, which was funny at the time, by the way."
I didn't need this.
"Tim Walz is adding, and he was sort of the do no harm candidate, as many people described."
Watch where the candidates spend their time.
"He has become hyper focused on Pennsylvania, telling Pennsylvania's at the Butler rally that Harrison Walls will take away."
He was in the Bush and the Obama administrations.
"So listen, let me know what you think about this and what you think about them saying that this would have caused a civil war."
And you're right about VEEP.
"Now, crowd size alone does not predict who's going to win."
"For instance, this piece we're looking at, it talks about third party candidates, which, you know, can sometimes be a big factor."
"They could still play a spoiler role, but not for the reasons that they anticipated."
And that was the final one before the election ended up being 1.2 percentage points.
And it don't make sense.
"I mean, seriously, insider advantage back in 2020, the same time period had a D plus three."
"Well, I'll maybe plan my trip a little bit more last minute Vegas."
"And so take a look at how he decided to essentially go off message, go off that strategy and instead attack Kamala Harris."
"Yeah, it does feel like if they can't even get their strategy right in Philly, what hope do they have for the rest of Pennsylvania?"
That's what we need.
Hillary up by eight point two.
"Senator, can you give us just a quick 30 seconds on efforts to undermine the voting process in the state of Pennsylvania?"
"Inside team Harris's unusual levels of finger pointing, which is very typical for these people, where there's no leadership at all."
He's sending a message out loud and clear and he's going to be the next president of the United States.
Polls saw for decades that they supported by two to one measures.
"Joining us now, Pennsylvania's Senior Senator, Democrat Bob Casey."
"Can you believe and the end one year ago, Trump told that same story, but he's acting now like it happened again."
Her willingness to speak directly to a community is a sign of respect.
I use the Heather colors.
Not this big.
And we're not trying to go back to where Donald Trump took us several years ago.
"Today, the choices Kamala Harris and Donald Trump."
Now let's go back to the present and look at the latest polls.
Kamala Harris received 47 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 48 percent.
I just want to be in the irony of there being a gas station behind it.
"And you know what, they're right."
He didn't know him.
That's a greater number of votes than the margin that he lost Pennsylvania by in 2020.
A second Democrat elected official in the state described Lew as AWOL.
What do you think of running?
Thank you so much for joining us on Tower Hour.
But obviously it is.
Will he count the votes for the Democratic candidate that won or will he not?
"And for those that don't believe me that these are bad polls back in 2020, Franklin and Marshall claimed Biden was going to win Pennsylvania by six, which, by the way, back in 2016, their final poll was Clinton plus 11."
I'll get your reaction on the other side.
" Alright man, so we got some absolutely massive news here for Kamala Harris in the state of Pennsylvania Now we've been keeping you updated about what's going on a big thing in 2020 that actually happened was the third party support was almost Non-existent or very muted and that was a big thing that also is able to let Biden win in 2020 as opposed to 2016 Where there was a lot of third party support because Hillary was obviously, you know, not not a really great candidate So a lot of people ended up voting third party 2020 was a different scenario because it was so dire with Covid and everything and so he was able to win So what we have here is this article says Cornell West can't be on Pennsylvania's presidential ballot court decides So Cornell West of course, he's like a left-wing dude who's running He was definitely pulling some votes from Kamala Harris and definitely more from Kamala Harris and Trump So it says Cornell West can't be on Pennsylvania's presidential ballot court decides."
What he had is talking points.
"Anyway, so if you're in Pennsylvania and you're not freaking registered to vote, not registered to vote, registering people like my man, Scott Pressler, you're wrong."
They are driving rigs on election day.
"And so especially for our beautiful truckers, we are pushing them to get a mail-in ballot."
"His speech earlier in the day, play it over the weekend."
Democrats back Harris 95 to 4 percent.
One of them.
"There's a lot of good things happening, but a lot more work to do."
That's all I could say about it.
Difficult.
How's it?
"""'Voters are able to see through his empty promises,' stated Shapiro, adding that Trump's efforts to remake himself as a working-class hero in the 2024 race-ring hollow given his track record."
"Fetterman did not end up winning by six percentage points, but it kind of just shows you how these things are really starting to shake out."
I'm amazed.
That's why Trump being just even tied in the average is a big deal.
That's your grandson?
It was a drawing.
"And I think what people wanna hear is, Pennsylvanians wanna hear is, do something that is gonna fix the inflation that I've been dealing with, the immigration, which is a big issue as well."
"Yeah, Georgia's a key state again for the Trump campaign."
"So the final 2020 was, you know, Biden plus one or whatever, but compared to the RCP average from 2020 and 2016, that's a seven to five-point shift in favor of Trump."
Certainly not locked up.
"The vast majority of people in Georgia said no, even though statistically it's somewhat close, not that wages have overstripped and compensated in all respects for inflation, but it's much closer than people perceive."
"And when you look around Pittsburgh, is the enthusiasm that allegedly Kamala Harris generated anywhere evident?"
You're a primer on the race to the White House.
How amazing was that?
"And I know it's only late September, early October."
I know what they're trying to do.
So this is something that they want to see continue to tie together along with funding for the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan.
We've also got this Donald Trump favored in all seven battleground states under latest election model.
"Look, we're in March."
We'll see what happens.
It looks like anywhere from eight to 10 bullets were fired.
"And finding entertainment news, Sam Morelos plays Nikki Velasco in the Netflix sitcom That Nighty Show."
I'll sing this because he chose that for a purpose for a purpose.
Because she has none.
"That's why Pennsylvania, everyone's throwing everything at the state."
So we'll see how it works out for her.
They were always going to vote for Biden and the remaining Haley voters would come home to Donald Trump.
"Rather than merely pursuing partisan agendas, he underlined that the problem of protecting democratic values would be the primary focus of the election that would take place in 2024."
Why was it so important?
One of those values that Reuben shares and that's talked a lot about in the campaign is freedom.
"But President Trump conducting diplomacy with our enemies, I think, was very important for our country to maintain our status as the world's number one superpower."
It's a message.
Polling is indicating that Trump is actually polling better than a lot of Republican candidates have in the past among Hispanic voters.
US election explained.
"That's it for me, everybody."
He's actually pulling ahead of a lot of Republicans and helping them.
This despite the fact that shootings for literally every reason over the past however many years have been by right-wing people who follow all these right-wing demagogues that are about to be like the leftist what caused this and everything and use this as their opportunity expect to see people pulling comments online of people previously talking about how Trump should get you know.
But a genocide outweighs all of this.
Engaging these voters is essential for campaign success.
That's the role of social media in all of this.
We're not sure how they were able to get a weapon in.
"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president."
Obviously she has been someone that's been very stalwart and really hitting home the message with respect to reproductive rights.
"It's a sign of how close this race is, but it's also a demonstration of the fact that these are states where there were serious concerns that a Joe Biden candidacy would sag down the ticket and not just lose to Trump potentially in some of those swing states, but also maybe drag down more down-ballot races of Congress and Senate, et cetera."
"In 2020, I made very clear where I stand."
His appeal.
And how do you see it going in the future the ads in 1988 and that whole campaign?
"Kamala Harris is winning Wisconsin and Michigan, but by less than one point."
This is a big one.
There were reports that people were looking for shade hiding by diesel generators connected to some of the food vendors.
I am not sure why it isn't.
"Section 6 â€“ Pennsylvania The Keystone State, known for its rich history and significant political influence."
Harris over the weekend kind of go to Trump and saying that he believes that she believes his handlers don't want the mic to be on because they're afraid of what he might say.
"Take us to school, Senator."
"And now, eight years after he was elected, after all the arguments against Obamacare have been proven to be wrong, and even folks who don't like me sure like that insurance, when he was asked about it, he said, well, I have a concept of a plan for how I'm going to do it."
"Well, you're losing Pennsylvania and therefore Trump's pathway to winning is all but secured."
"So what this means is that there is about a 180,000 vote gap between Republicans and Democrats in the state of Pennsylvania right now."
They've tried to stop it.
"Peter explained how, look, Biden is getting about 94% in the Pennsylvania presidential primary."
"Nevertheless, farmers are no strangers to the risk and the gamble that they take every single day in order to do what they know and love and that is to farm their land."
Donald Trump actually has been quite supportive of IVF.
"So let's take Allegheny County, for example."
Well that remains to be seen as you know Nora but certainly a very spirited conversation among these voters as they watch tonight's debate but clearly not all of their answers were not all of their questions were answered tonight so that is why I know that they should hear more.
"The top line numbers, the horse race numbers, look pretty good for Kamala Harris, but specifically on the economy, a remarkable turn here to find her essentially tied, certainly within the margin, with Donald Trump on the issue that will likely, for most voters, decide this election."
I'm different hard fly.
"He says it's like 107,000 people."
"Wisconsin for one, I mentioned Harris will be there this week visiting her supporters."
"And of course they do the thing where we've added all like he says the, this is the strongest economy."
"Thank you so much, sir."
"I think what's interesting is how Biden is going to message this because we've all said for the better part of a decade now, and we've said, you know, this could be the thing that finally turned suburban voters against Trump."
It says it's designed to make it easier for people who support Mr. Trump to volunteer to help his campaign.
There you get it.
"I mean, this is a state that back in 2016 and 2020, the polls were garbage."
The Biden-Harris administration has fought a war on American energy production since day one.
"Starting with Franklin and Marshall, back in April they had a registered voter survey that showed Biden dominating Trump 38-48."
And that is all I got to say for this video.
"Here he goes, crime is down."
"If he does, he probably doesn't win."
The razor will last you a lifetime.
He's not winning this country.
So use the proper labels.
I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous.
"So I know, like personally, we're not thrilled about the environmental impact of it, but we know that the money is important to people."
Is that an important issue?
"So hypothetically speaking, if we have 100,000 mail-in ballots, we have to deal with double the amount of envelopes, which is a long process."
"And that is just a bad phrasing, right?"
"I just, I did not succeed in a scrapple eating contest, but it's pork products and some filler, but you can do it, fry it up on a grill."
But the one thing that we do know is that Donald Trump is the favorite in Pennsylvania.
I think that's that remains to be seen.
Can you explain how you're going to pay for those?
"The eighth poll was conducted between September 20th and 24 by Beacon Research, Shaw and Company Research among 775 likely voters."
"On the one hand, he said that Trump's populist appeal from 2016 has significantly decreased, while on the other hand, he credited Harris's success to her ability to resonate with a diverse variety of individuals, including moderate Republicans and independents."
"I still think that there is a pathway for Harris, but in the last couple of days, it seems like there has been more data to suggest, uh, yeah, Trump's probably gonna win Pennsylvania."
Got to earn every vote.
She'll be back in the state on Wednesday for another rally.
I think the power of Gen Z was shown in 2020.
"You called veterans willing to risk their lives, suckers and losers."
Schmidt once had his own doubts about election security.
And Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona tweet last night made it look for a little bit like he thinks it's not him.
What you couldn't tell is that Taylor is dead.
"At the helm, lifelong Republican Al Schmidt stood up to former President Trump and refused to join attempts to overturn his loss four years ago."
"I hate that kind of mentality, but as I close, I want to say this, shout out to all the rich white liberals in Pennsylvania."
"If you're gonna place a bet, don't come to me just yet."
"Tell me, what do you want to see from your candidate at the debate on Tuesday?"
"Well, they don't show up in polls, but they show up and they are generally trending against Donald Trump."
And the next is Trump will 100% focus on cutting down the tax from 25% to 15% for companies who will manufacture in United States for example XYZ company manufactures in China and now they want to they are paying 25% tax and let's say example I'm telling you let's say they are they start manufacturing in United States so Trump promises for them to charge less tax so probably like around 15% tax and that will be really in benefit for America because it will bring a lot of jobs because he wants to bring jobs in the United States he doesn't want people to really starve or remain without jobs and all the foreigners are really coming here and just grabbing all the jobs and the Americans are really remaining behind without any jobs I'm talking about them skilled workers I'm not talking about the unskilled workers so the next is 37 days from now Trump says very very clear he's going to defeat lion Kamala Harris and sleepy Joe it makes me a little bit laugh the way because the way he says lion Kamala Harris and the sleepy Joe that's the reason it makes me laugh that's the only reason and I don't laugh on Kamala Harris or sleepy Joe because he's funny sometimes the next is Trump promises to lower the taxes and make life much better and easier and cleaner so they can really afford everything and clothing to groceries to fuel and everyday life of course all the families will be able to afford so they would love America more and more and they'll fall in love with this country more and more and of course they will be ready to give their lives for this country because he wants to make America the best place on the planet Earth now also Trump humbly acknowledges that if he loses if he loses this election and Kamala Harris wins then he doesn't care like he doesn't have he doesn't have anything bad to say about in return but he doesn't care but the only thing he's focusing on that is all he cares about is he wants to do his job what he promises and of course I think so he will do his job because that will be his last four years in his entire life so he wants to make America powerful again and America clean again and America great again so now he got three things powerful great and clean so he'll be focusing on this very very immensely and I think so that he will succeed 100% now Trump promises to bring the entire energy prices down and he will be focusing only on one thing on the golden oil under the feet of Americans that's of course that's patrol so now of course now he's just keep on saying of course drill baby drill so that means of course all the energy price will come down and we'll be able to afford the gas and like for now at present times we are struggling not we the the people who are making less money and having a little bit bigger families they are struggling to fill up the gas tanks in their cars and of course and he says they it'll he will make it very easier for them so they will be able to afford gas and fill up the tanks and also groceries and all other sectors so in this video as I covered all the points this are the takeaway points from his rally what he really what he recently made in Pennsylvania so now and one thing I want to talk about in the I want to touch this that and I'm pretty sure Trump if he loses if he loses if he loses I know he doesn't care because he cannot do anything after that but if he wins trust me I think so he will make America great again because he will clean with criminals he will close the borders and he will make America powerful again clean again and America great again and he wants to make America the manufacturing powerhouse that means all the manufacturing will take place in America with off I'm talking about the American companies like Apple of course it will manufacture in America 100% he will try to do that but if he does that believe me that would be great but again let's see what and what cost these companies will agree and not agree also but the points what he just put down in front of the people they were really amazing and really attracting and let's see how many votes will really get and based on that we will see where America is heading thank you so much for watching and see in the next video don't forget to subscribe the channel so it'll help me to to make more and more videos and see you next time bye bye take care
Weeks after the assassination attempt President Biden decided not to run for reelection and so as a result Trump now faces Vice President Kamala Harris.
"Yeah, and they've walked down the area or secured the area anyway a lot sooner than they did previously in July."
So similar margin of victory in Pittsburgh.
But do you find it just a little bit odd that it's every poll finding the shift every single one?
Insurance is sky high through the roof.
That was because they did an interior poll and they found that the majority of the people within the union endorsed Trump.
Why is politics...?
There's also a Discord server for you to go ahead and join on the screen.
Same poll had Biden up and sit by similar margins before Democrats forced him out.
It was called at roughly 2 a.m. on 2016 election night.
"When you buy a razor at Henson Shaving dot com slash pacman, use the code pacman to get a two year supply of blades for free."
Full of joy.
She needs to be running multiple points ahead.
And both campaigns know their best chance to win the White House is to win this state.
Who do you think won the 2020 election?
That's going to be a bigger mistake than anything that the marksman did.
 Here are the exact figures.
"In fact, I think it's an unconstitutional law, and it's a distraction from all the other stuff he's done that implicates his father."
 Welcome back to America Decides and CBS News coverage of the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.
"All right, Nathaniel Rinkage, our thanks to you as always in joining us now for more as political playbook co-author and ABC News contributor, Rachel Bade."
"Now, let's analyze all seven recent polls conducted in Pennsylvania."
But what is motivating them right now?
So there was like a 1.1% difference.
"Again, some areas where perhaps Donald Trump has shown some weakness with traditional voters as Republican voters rather, as sort of that Republican coalition is being reimagined and repurposed by the Trump campaign."
Is there anything else you want to mention?
But I want to hear what you guys have to say.
This is not some grand conspiracy.
"If Wisconsin votes Republican, so does Pennsylvania and of course Michigan, but you get the point that it hasn't happened in like 50 years where one candidate wins Wisconsin and the other wins Pennsylvania."
"Forty three percent of MSNBC viewers think the Republican Party is the biggest enemy facing America, although I will say that 56 percent of Newsmax people think the Democrat Party is."
"According to the last census, about 93,000 residents, so not even close to the population numbers of the city of Philadelphia."
Let's go vote.
I think we all agree.
"Yeah, we should put some balloons."
"And what's it, how is that a trick?"
" Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Senior Vice President of Business Development at Deep Well Services, John Saboe."
Remember what wasn't like what 95% of black women voted for Barack Obama and like 94% voted for Hillary.
"Oh, I love you, Sloth."
"Actually, he can't afford to lose Wisconsin."
"Early this morning, KDK's Barry Pintar loaded up into a car and met up with Dan Snyder of CBS News Philadelphia in the heart of Pennsylvania."
"Talking about Melania, what?"
"Obviously, you see a little bit of blue on that map where President Biden won."
"But assuming that Donald Trump wins those states, Pennsylvania is the ball game."
There's no way.
"Yeah, the president is going to be in Pennsylvania for three days."
I think you have to investigate the other side of it.
"It's not to decide who the president of the United States is, or who the governor is, or who the senator is, or anything else like that."
"He fist-bumped, as you said."
"OK, let's do a couple of more fast questions."
And she was pretty blunt about the need for more cultural understanding from the campaign.
"We have a long way to go before the election, but still at the same time, we're knocking on the door."
"I think that's what you're getting at, Congressman."
I think there's a lot of work to be done.
"Let's see if she can expand her narrow edge now in Pennsylvania, which does award 19 electoral votes."
Raise your hand.
"Democrats concerned about the southern border are rooting for Senator Mark Kelly, who represents the border state of Arizona."
I know you all in this room are involved.
MAGA folks are the ones who are taking money from Russia and Trump continues to boost these MAGA votes.
" The race is a dead heat in the state of Pennsylvania according to pretty much all of the polling including the latest from CBS You gov so much attention is being paid to the state because it was because of its 19 Electoral votes and how crucial they are in fact no Democrats since 1948 has won the White House without winning, Pennsylvania Joining us now Democratic senator from Pennsylvania John Fetterman senator."
That's the bottom line.
There is a 48-48 tie between the two candidates with a margin of error of three percentage points.
But I'll put it this way.
"See, this is the narrative that they're trying."
"According to some and it pleased the Lord, but you don't really care for music."
He's not too happy.
Take a look at just a few of them.
"The results reveal that Kamala Harris is polling at 46 percent, while Donald Trump leads with 49 percent, granting him a three-point advantage in this battleground state."
"Person that you follow on the internet calls the election, right?"
"And if they don't, you tell them he's got concepts of a plan and it don't make sense."
Hope you've subscribed so you don't miss out on a single episode.
It's a dead heat toss-up in the polling folks.
Voter fraud is widespread.
It's a consistent thing that we are now seeing.
And I also asked him how he's differentiating himself with Trump on policy.
"Tim Walz is popular, but so is she."
The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech.
"Yes, right now, it is in fact tied."
What is this ideology?
Kamala Harris spends the weekend vetting top vice presidential contenders preparing for a battleground campaign blitz starting in Pennsylvania among the favorites to be the democratic running made Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro were taking the pulse of voters in Shapiro's hometown in Montgomery County.
It truly is that right there.
We lose weight.
"Oh, I did it."
Donald Trump for America.
And you'll see him again and again.
"By maintaining focus on these issues, Trump's campaign can keep the conversation centered on topics that mobilize their base and appeal to undecided voters."
"But if she adds in, say, Arizona along with Georgia, that's a possibility."
She is going to North Carolina for a handful of rallies on Thursday.
And so I think the grace that has to be awarded to this community and this point of time is that this issue is as has to be as prioritized as those that I spoke to domestically.
"Now, some people might claim, well, this is just the polling in Pennsylvania."
"We have an AK-47 inside and people say, you know what, let's just and I don't, I knew about an AK-47 from a few weeks ago."
Because the country's falling apart.
If Harris wins it.
"And yet the college educated is not, is minimal compared to the college educated in some college."
How are you going to vote?
Let's talk about this Brit Bear interview.
We do have a over criminalization of drug crimes in the country.
Donald Trump is clearly alive.
"To be honest with you, I understand that politics get a lot of people enraged, but I don't think anybody deserves to lose their life at all, right?"
The Simpsons already have predicted he was going out in 2024.
I've been a resident here since 2007.
"Lin, who has a keen interest in financial regulation and economic equity, supports Harris' plans to reform the financial sector and close the wealth gap."
"And I think they still have improved, but this cycle, congressionally, there's a few blind spots."
They will be a blessing to you as well.
That's despite there being three.
I think he's got character defects.
That's better than wasting a lot of words.
"So really at this point, Harris cannot lose any more states."
 Hey guys welcome back to another video today we will be talking about the state of Pennsylvania in the 2024 presidential race and now it really is going more and more towards Kamala Harris as the election approaches it's now only 24 days away she is simply running away with the state of Pennsylvania.
"Meanwhile, Governor Newsom is expected to be in Harris's spin room tonight."
This narrative can be used to challenge the Democratic position and appeal to voters who are worried about potential vulnerabilities in the voting system.
The incident is being reviewed.
And they found the same thing.
"People will want to die, but will not find a way."
There's Nola.
And basically just sloganeers the entire time.
Do you feel like there's a problem with the political rhetoric in this country?
"He's going, they tried to shoot me."
"In 2016, in 2020, Biden carried the county by about 1500 votes."
So it's hard to say how much these polls could be misleading.
"Even then, do you really think Michigan is going to vote like four to five points to the left of Pennsylvania?"
We're not done fighting.
"Well, we'll be here breaking it all down every step of the way."
How much do you think that matters to undecided voters?
"The speaker discussed the shifting dynamics of media representation, claiming certain narratives are intentionally omitted to shield specific political figures, underscoring perceived bias in mainstream journalism."
"I'm the only governor in the entire country with a divided legislature, one house led by Democrats, one led by Republicans."
If we win Pennsylvania we will win the whole thing.
And the great sign.
But let's just look.
You guys are living in a real dump.
You've been a senator since 2007.
You can't just order a donut?
That is an issue.
It's a lot more of a state issue.
"Again, this is not an end all be all because maybe there'll be a bunch of requests coming up, but this is comparing, it's not comparing 2020 versus 2024 versus 2020."
"When I say rhino, I'm a Republican in any moment."
You have got to send him back to the United States Senate for the time that I was in the United States Senate and worked with Bob.
I should laugh.
Do you see Mark Cuban is now wearing the Keith Olbermann and the Rachel Maddow glasses.
"It's an important issue for Pennsylvania voters, certainly for pro-life people and also for pro choice people."
"Now, does that mean for sure Democrats will lose Pennsylvania?"
Why the Biden administration's continue to have an inexplicable affinity for Iran along the way is pretty inexplicable in itself.
And black turnout is poised to probably dip a little bit.
We've seen it when we did it in the first year of our administration.
"Martha Green â€“ $1,000,000 Martha Green, an heir to a Pennsylvania steel dynasty, has long been a supporter of progressive causes."
This appeal to authenticity resonates with many supporters who value transparency in politics.
"Parker said, I know what's at stake here."
"I think it's certainly possible for Quinnipiac in this poll to not be accurately representing Trump's stage of support in Pennsylvania, while at the same time acknowledging the fact that Harrison may have a slight lead in the state."
"And I really hope that when they're in office, we can continue to bring prices down."
He lost in 2020.
"You say, Well, what is exactly Donald Trump's plan for higher prices?"
"In fact, Trump is now so confident of victory that he has begun moving beyond the battleground states to stage rallies in democratic strongholds like California."
And my apologies if I've said his name incorrectly.
The man had character.
"While preparing for the debate, a source tells CBS News that Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke over the phone this weekend."
Let's see how they play out.
"You know, if you come face to face with a politician that you disagree with, just argue with them, say you don't agree with them."
"At Harris's rally this weekend, she said her administration would get rid of attacks on tips for service workers."
Was he shot?
He was like basically vegetable.
"Now here in 2024, Democrats enter this cycle with far less momentum than 4 years ago."
They can't afford their electricity bills or their daycare bill.
Trump has sort of ignored this as an issue.
So that's why you see him going there.
For a good while.
"But if she refuses to certify and then makes herself president, you'd be OK with that?"
Do you think that somebody planned it?
So the election fever gains momentum.
By design this stage behind me and everything else the pop and circumstance of this all feels very similar to what it looked like that day but everything has changed not only the state of the race but also those security measures in place to my right there is a row of trailers that are blocking the line of sight from that shed where the shooter fired on July 13th to that stage behind me and on top of that those trailers are snipers and back snipers are pretty much everywhere to be seen it is very clear.
"So not only is this photo block much more Republican, there's just less votes here."
"By the way, the 9-11 victims are not happy."
"Well, I remember he was saying that, you know, Barack Obama wasn't born in this country."
What does that mean?
"The amount of television ad spending by Democrats and Republicans in Pennsylvania reached $350 million, $142 million more than the second-ranking state, Michigan."
Kamala Harris will take you all.
I am not saying that.
Absolutely Kamala Harris if elected she would be the first female vice president this so-called last glass ceiling Does that matter to you at all that she's a woman?
This video is being shadow band.
Maybe it's a fluke.
"But it's a historical moment that matters in rallying people, boosting morale and telling people you need to get out, you need to vote."
"Well, so when we consider the contrasting economic visions here and frankly where the candidates have been, Harris made that comment on childcare in Philadelphia with the NABJ, one of the swing states, one of the key states we're talking about here."
"OK, do you notice who he's speaking to right now?"
He won.
But Trump has endorsed him which has made him the front-runner in this race.
It's all on Pennsylvania.
"And in 2020, you can argue the only reason that the RCP average was anywhere close to being accurate, actually was spot on, was because of Susquehanna, Trafalgar, insider advantage, finding very small Trump leads."
He's obsessed with himself.
"Because Hannibal Lecter was a serious psycho, right?"
I think it is safe to say that MSNBC is not reporting with the same level of integrity as Newsmax.
"And not just as a governor, but as a father of four, I try and raise our kids to love thy neighbor, to care about their fellow man, their fellow woman."
"If it's Harris plus one right now, that's not good, but it does show a consistent trend compared to just a week ago, a week ago, you had the New York Times Quinnipiac finding Harris plus three Harris plus four."
He's a patriotic American.
"I can't tell you that between Bush, Obama, Trump or Biden, that we have had alignment or agreement on their global policies."
He was a brave man.
It is shameful.
"Well, that makes me even more suspicious."
"But the thing about this cycle is that when you look at the polling, when you talk to some of these pollsters and folks who are in the focus groups actually talking to voters, the thing that is top of mind for them is actually not abortion."
"So there's just really no justification for what 538 is doing here other than, oh, we're going to placate our liberal audience and kind of just pacify them, especially after this came out, because if you're up in Pennsylvania in this poll, you're up in Pennsylvania."
"If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?"
It's not a hypothetical.
"Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit."
"And I think what people will end up remembering about Joe Biden is the fact that his family, his staff, every Democrat in Congress, most of the people up here on this stage, of course not you, but they covered for his what was very great cognitive decline."
"And with that being said, seeing Donald Trump's willingness to come back to a place where he nearly died, I'm getting off the podcast chair and I'm coming out for the first time in a few years to one of these rallies."
It's understood that you are running for president for all people of America.
"We're all just reacting to what we saw go down and you know Everyone else's reaction and just the news that's what we do over here on this channel as well If you're new make sure to subscribe and join the discussion in the comments but um, yeah, man Cia What more can I say?"
"According to O'Neill's U.S., one out of every five Hispanics will vote in their first presidential election this year."
But look at Harris voters.
He has a lead in Georgia.
Is it going to be Maga Republicans?
"You know, I think he's going to pick up where he left off."
Unraveling surprising shifts that could change the course of this historic election.
Harris 51 in Pennsylvania to Trump's 45.
"And if it wasn't even for the Bloomberg poll, I mean Harris plus five, really?"
"This is somebody who's doing apologia for, for a guy who, who is denying the biraciality of, of Kamala Harris while he himself has three biracial kids."
And that is what I want to see in a president of the United States of America.
"Yeah, it's a tricky one."
"First Post decodes the US election, explains how America chooses its president."
"I mean, from my perspective, it seemed like he's hands on with a lot of things."
What got me paying attention to politics was in 2016.
"Trump continues to emphasize issues related to immigration, border security, and opposing the expansion of social programs, which he argues contribute to the rising national debt."
I'll be posting the Wisconsin and Michigan videos in a few days ahead of time.
This is something that she has a lot of credibility on.
So we're not sure if any of these things are gonna move the metric really.
Have a great weekend and we'll see you next week.
He's just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues.
Much more grassroots.
I want that same kind of grace.
"Mr. Pittsburgh, how are you?"
"But first, I want to play something that former President Obama said thisâ€”last week, I should sayâ€”about this and see what you think of it."
"Trump addressed the incident directly, expressing gratitude for his survival and his ability to continue speaking to his supporters, emphasizing the importance of resilience and determination in the face of adversity."
And you get all these exclusive articles as well.
"Somebody who was raised in the middle class, believes in the values that built this country, worked her way through college in McDonald's, served with distinction in every office she has ever held, who is as prepared for the job as any nominee for President has ever been."
"This whole U.S. Steel thing is emblematic, perhaps, of manufacturing jobs and the importance of manufacturing jobs in western Pennsylvania, a key part of the strategy for winning Pennsylvania this year."
That seems to be thriving.
Does that change how you think you're gonna end up voting in November?
Remember it was only two weeks ago President Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris to lead the party.
Hospitals overrun.
I've seen this room.
"The survey, executed by Fabrizio Lee and associates NGBAL and sponsored by the Wall Street Journal, involves 600 registered voters from the state."
"They also tend to be less prone to supporting, you know, foreign wars and intervention."
Just look at their numbers in 2020.
And let's look at other pollsters.
"The reason that this is closely divided is because Pennsylvanians are as split as the rest of the country, perhaps even more so."
Why do you think that is?
I watched Tim Scott on television yesterday.
I knew we knew the family's life crushed forever.
"But let's take you to the aforementioned Bucks County and welcome back to News Nation correspondent, Caitlin Becker, who's been going around talking to voters there."
"I mean, Trump's already spoken about it at one of his recent rallies in which he said that her proposals now for putting a tax on food and all the rest of it."
Then you take your ass to a community you haven't really even been part of since the 2000s.
Let's say both of you were the senators of Pennsylvania.
Are there sort of votes being left on the table if they don't go out and get these voters?
"So the first thing we're gonna see here is we're gonna come up here, of course, I mean, I started doing a video, someone wants to go outside, someone being the big baby over there, the big old, it's raining outside, puppy, rain outside, right?"
I think there was like an opera like song to.
"Jim Greenwood, thank you very much for being with me."
So we'll have to see what happens on that front.
He has a very high floor.
I'm now turning on 80 songs to go back to the eighties.
"Can you share with me what policies have inspired you to, you know, if there's anything in particular that really stands out to you is why you're voting for him?"
"Before President Trump is refusing to commit to accepting the results if he loses, if he does refuse, what happens here in Pennsylvania?"
"Right now, he's slated to be the victor in Arizona."
"Perhaps the most disturbing moment of Trump's Pennsylvania rally came when he encouraged his audience to chant send them back, referring to legal immigrants in the town of Springfield, Ohio."
"Lisa Desjardins takes us inside one Pennsylvania county with a track record of picking the winner, a place both parties think could signal how the state and possibly the country could vote."
Like what?
I really would be hugely surprised that people hadn't made up their mind by now.
It's hard to say.
"Social media is playing a huge role in this election, with both campaigns using it to reach a broader audience."
This is saying that it shot someone in the face on a hunting trip and the guy he shot in the face apologized to him.
"No, it's okay."
He cannot lose it.
"What are you hearing about our current president, President Biden?"
So they both are the same and I am certainly not voting for any of them at all.
Ever.
Don't just quote what the news tells you man.
You can't exactly do that.
But now it's clear that there really isn't any search for Harris and any surge.
How many times have you seen Jill Biden give a speech about Kamala?
"This is about as significant because ever since the debate, President Biden has sharply declining in Pennsylvania and Donald Trump has been inclining."
"Because even if Trump were to win North Carolina and Georgia and Arizona, three states he's currently leading in the polls right now, if Harris wins Wisconsin and Michigan and Nevada, three states she's leading in right now, she would win the presidency."
Natural gas is the way in which we heat most of our homes in Western Pennsylvania.
We saw him here in Pittsburgh just last week as he kicked off a battleground blitz.
"Yeah, maybe there could be something to that."
Just hold on a second.
He's got lots of money to spend and he's spending it pretty effectively.
"Starting with the eighth poll, conducted by the Bullfinch Group from August 8 to 11 with 1,500 registered voters, Harris received 45% of the vote, while Trump received 41%."
"See, my daughter's little, my daughter's little Halloween pumpkin over there."
But I do believe art and comedy and music that is the engine driving these topics to the surface.
Let's get to four million subscribers.
"You know, then we just got a lot of custom shirts, you know, nice soft styles."
Former president Obama called out black male voters last week.
"We know some of those people will be voting at the polls and just because they're less afraid of a pandemic, but still, you wouldn't expect that to fully carry over."
"I mean, it's way too early to say for sure, but it definitely makes you wonder if we're seeing a shift in the political winds, you know."
That's un-American.
But just him as a person.
"States like Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, the seven states, the Democratic Party has been focusing all of their efforts in for this election cycle."
Michigan has 15 electoral votes.
Where do you want to begin?
That's all he's not talking about what his plans are.
He's at 50 percent and Kamala Harris is down there at 47 percent.
That was very pivotal.
Tammy Baldwin is also not up by 12 either.
"First of all, let me ask you, because you've been following us closely, do you see any scenario in the next 22 days where that issue is resolved before Election Day?"
"If you need to get in touch with that group, there's a way I have their information."
And apparently he is going to round up undocumented immigrants in the country as well.
"Every other pollster, Emerson, Insider Advantage, Trafalgar, Wall Street Journal, Atlas Intel, Rasmussen, everyone is showing Trump is up in Pennsylvania."
"And of course, join the channel today."
Let me hear that music please.
And it does seem as if Harris is in a much weaker position than these individuals.
Mary Ann Williamson continuing to dump on Trump because of the eating cats issue will create blowback on November 5th.
He is falling further and further behind.
The hip hop community needs to hear more from VP Harris about what is her plans and plans of action for black males.
Just in general.
"The chat GPT maker open AI has reported a rising trend in misuse of its AI models to create fake content, and this includes articles and social media posts designed to sway elections."
"My challenge to all of them, to all of you â€” let's pretend and say they're watching me right now â€” to all of you, if you really want to help the Haitian immigrants in your towns, if you really want to stand up for them and show the world that they are welcome, that they are important members of your communities, don't just talk."
"As much as we're divided, I think you're starting to see the country coming together, at least the consensus that is on the side of protecting those rights and making sure that we hold big corporations accountable and that we change the tax code so that low-income folks and middle-class folks get a break and the corporations and the billionaires have to pay their fair share."
We see what's happening now in the West Bank where the El Jazeta offices have been shuttered for the next 45 days.
So it wouldn't be unusual for him to take this next step.
There's even an argument to be made.
"I'm not defending G. Let's uh, I had this next."
"Doesn't this link back to what we were talking about at the beginning, about the fact that government is so distant from ordinary people, where a minor infraction ends up that you have your life destroyed?"
I'm not talking about the clean again on the streets he's talking about about the criminals.
"But the point is, is if there is any leftward bias at all in the polling industry in Pennsylvania, Trump wins Pennsylvania."
"Susquehanna polling running from September 16th to 22nd shows the same result, 46% for both candidates."
I know you've been doing some reporting on this.
"And if you couple that with COVID and changes to the election system and the BLM stuff and all this, you talk about the key issues in 2020."
Is that what she's talking about?
"I mean, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell made a version of that argument quite recently."
"If it wouldn't work for you, why should it work for the President of the United States?"
Pennsylvania is probably it's the state that Kamala Harris can't afford to lose.
She's yet to do a press conference.
"This is false, by the way, literally blocks from the tiny side door where I entered false."
Me too.
But I just think the further and further we get away from COVID.
"Church-going, yeah, but I bet it's voodoo church!"
And a lot of people didn't see our most recent video because I released it late last night.
It is not over.
"Students here at Arizona, you could try it with your professors."
Do you remember that?
That is our job.
"And at that point, you cannot afford to lose a single state of your Trump outside of like Nevada."
Listeners can keep up with this story and more at thecentersquare.com.
"Tell me among suburban Republicans, among centrists, to make sure that if there is any unexpected low turnout in Philadelphia or Pittsburgh, in those urban areas where the Democrats have a lot of historically significant support among labor unions, among voters of color, among other workers in those cities, if those numbers are not at the levels they need to be, that means they need to do well in the suburbs."
And we're going to go that was we're going to SUSCA HANA because that was Muinberg with a 6% margin of error.
"And Trump continued to target the Haitian immigrant community in Springfield, Ohio."
Like she doesn't want her past to be brought up.
Don't worry.
He's leading in them.
I think I'm gonna cancel my trip.
Our oldest is our daughter.
I think it would be fair to say that we're disillusioned and that there's a reason why people kind of feel like they don't want to turn out or like they're not inspired by what's going on in the government at the moment.
"So, Mary Alice, you you're in Pennsylvania right now where Vice President Kamala Harris held a rally last night."
She understands the important role those energy jobs play here in Pennsylvania.

That really is.
"That's why we saw Miami-Dade County for the first time in generations vote for a Republican governor, vote for Republican Governor Ron DeSantis."
Sperg for your sir.
Their polls in Pennsylvania in 2020 were amazing.

Didn't comment about complaints about Lew.
"You know, like people can use artwork to wake the world up."
Everybody.
We appreciate you both being here.
"McCormick is kind of lagging Trump's vote share, I think because there are just a lot of Pennsylvanians who haven't made up their mind about him."
"Now in the meantime, Trump got up."
Only 32 percent of CNN watchers say protecting our democracy.
"We're using their terms, right?"
How's this county feeling about the election?

"So Pennsylvania, just on paper, it makes the most sense why it's a must win state."
Ryan made.

The economy remains at the forefront.
It was staged.

"This could lead to increased voter confidence and potentially higher turnout among Trump supporters, which could be a decisive factor in a closely contested state."
"Biden carried Allegheny County, about 60-40."
One reason they are hopeful is that is how they've surpassed the GOP in the issue of enthusiasm.
He's made it clear where he stands.
Biden helped write the Violence Against Women Act as a U.S. senator.
"I spoke to a child, a young girl who crossed the border with her mother when she was six years old and she had been separated from her for three years."
A significant development as suburbanites make up about half of the electorate.
"My daughter goes to Lafayette College, play soccer there."
"I know there's a weird scenario where demographically speaking, maybe Michigan votes the right of Pennsylvania."

"You think when people talk about the suburbs, they're not thinking about y'all?"
You are and the fifth trumpet brings the first terror.
"If we have this sort of equivalent of Kobe Bryant or Steph Curry or LeBron or something like that, they want to join the team."
"How political talks is so, so, uh-huh."
It's part of it.

It reinforces that you're weird and you're a rambler.
"OK, so we've got some interesting, if not a little confusing data from those polls."
"And by the time we reached the election, she became someone with a positive approval rating."

That's what Democrats are not mentioning.
"You know, comedians, they can say what they want because they're just being funny, but they're sliding that truth in there."
It doesn't really matter.
There's more on the media turning on her about crime statistics.
That's what it is.
" Hello, public opinion aficionados, and welcome to RAS Muscle Report, the independent pollster who is the arch nemesis of MSNBC."

It's the biggest state that in polling is still a toss up.
"Tony DiUlio, an independent, says he will be listening for substance and style."
What does that look like?
"But they do have a pathway forward with Pennsylvania now, with Tim Walz and Kamala Harris, and that's what the data has proven to us, that even the Republican pollsters, which try really hard to show Donald Trump the advantage point, show Kamala Harris tied and dead even, which is already a massive improvement off of where President Biden was when he was down five points."
"Shapiro, you want to get a coffee?"

"They were in Reading, Pennsylvania."
"so literally anything is super important and I think um Trump strategy is to sort of like alienate as many well not strategies Maybe not doing this on purpose But the Trump campaign keeps alienating more and more groups and so a common strategy appears to be to make a bigger and bigger tent So a bigger tent that she or a bigger group that she's opening up the tent to now is moderate Republicans Another group also, you know, like for example Trump is sort of alienating I guess a lot of JD Vance is doing a lot of it to where he was saying that you know Like grandmother's only role was to raise children and you know, childless women cat ladies or whatever He's they're alienating as many groups as humanly possible."
You all know anybody who doesn't know how tariffs work?
"While attendance was low, confidence was not."

As we saw at this law school in Harrisburg.
"To the point of the third parties that you mentioned, a recent Reuters poll showed that 40 percent of Arab and Muslim voters in Michigan are now backing the Green Party candidate Jill Stein."

"Oh, no, it speaks volumes."
"But one of them is this feeling about the economy, because if you look at the numbers of the economy, inflation is cooling."
Why would we not accept the results?
That's exactly what I've been expecting.
We come together in these moments of struggle.
"Everything looks good from a, I guess you would say, a metric standpoint in the state of Pennsylvania."
It's kind of crazy.
This is something the White House is strongly against.

"They're not the ones, obviously, but it's not everything."
The same people will be behind the scenes running the country because Kamala is incompetent.

Donald Trump's recent outbursts in Pennsylvania highlight the growing concerns around his fitness for office.
Moments after shots have rung out at a rally where President Trump was addressing the crowd.
But it was interesting over the weekend.
Shapiro can get all the votes in Pennsylvania and we can go ahead and win it.
"Be it Vice President Harris or former President Trump, I want to understand electoral politics that we have at play."
Can't help that.
I think we have to get control of the media.
It means that Donald Trump needs to win one of three States in order to become president.
I've led a very full life that way.
Our Natalie Brand spoke with voters in Pennsylvania about what it's like living in such a hotly contested state this election cycle.
Pennsylvania is the largest with 19 electoral votes.

"But Dr. Oz has been that guy in Trump's circle, extended circle for a while."
"All right, so let's talk politics here."
They both are freaking straight out of central casting for what an assassin of the president looks like.
I haven't seen nothing done.
"And that's where I think you see a stark contrast, right?"
"Like text people now, now Yeah."
"Your take on that rally here in Glendale, have you ever seen anything like that before?"
"That's why they're running this misinformation campaign now against Jill Stein, or a vote for Jill Stein, there's a vote for Trump, a vote for Cornel West, there's a vote for Trump."
The argument that he made was that Vice President Harris has been successful in creating genuine ties with voters who are members of the working class.
"And after that, he never ended up taking questions again to the former president."
"This is part of that conversation, clearly."
You see the clues?
And they want to support the sandwich generation which is usually people in their 30s to 50s who are simultaneously taking care of their aging parents as well as their own children.
We will not allow Donald Trump to come to our town without us having a presence to show people that there is an alternative.
"He tried to die in office They have no shame Let's get them through this election Let's get rid of this trump era once and for all the right way Not by assassins bullets, but let's get rid of trump the right way And then we get that progressive movement pushing harder and harder Okay But the line that i'm pushing for y'all Is Gretchen Whitmer governor of michigan who will instantly take michigan?"
"For me, it's just I always hated the idea that you have to buy the newest console when it comes out or you won't be able to play any of the new games."

"They were all so kind, so respectful and cordial."
"Across battlegrounds, they're in a virtual high."

"Many of them told me, well, they have issues on, you know, they're not happy with who they've traditionally voted for or their families have traditionally voted for on a myriad of issues."
For then Barack Obama to take his elitist ass.
"Yeah, Pennsylvania."
We had a great economy.
"And given him a second term when he doesn't have to worry about reelection, someone who will lie to his family, to his constituents, to world leaders, to his cabinet, just cannot be trusted to run this country."
The vice president is expected to name her running mate before she begins a barnstorming tour of battleground states on Tuesday.
He votes Pennsylvania values in the United States Senate.
He missed on purpose.
"Yeah, we're watching for that, definitely."
We have cut in half the Democrat advantage in just four years' time.
They've got the cash.
He's become a proud member of Hamas.
Don't you want an E.V.
But what about turnout?
I know that he's promised and he has asserted that he will bring Middle East peace.
What she did was instead attack Trump.
"They want to hear from their president, Trump."
"And that's why I think Erie is the ultimate kind of a bellwether County, certainly in Pennsylvania."
"But Nevada, obviously it's a little bit less."
"Is this tent gonna stand but Polish Americans, you know, I don't know if any Polish Americans are gonna comment on this post You know, where do you stand on this vote?"
"You know, the Commonwealth and you've got someone like that coming into the state and saying stuff like that."
I appreciate you.
What do you make of them?
"Harris, with her deep understanding of national policy and her ability to navigate complex issues, brings a comprehensive approach to governing."
"I really think, especially now more than ever, social media needs to be utilized as best as possible."
"With Obama states in 2008 and 2012, Trump carried Iowa and Ohio each by margins of around 8 to 9 points in 2016 and in 2020."
I mean you have to use your opponent's vulnerabilities against them.
"The night before, former President Trump held a rally just a few hours away, where he stoked fears about voting in Pennsylvania."
Not at all if here's how we're going to balance the budget to reduce the deficit.
"For Harris, key issues include health care reform, tackling climate change, and creating green jobs."
It's and it seems very baked in that they'll both get 200 something in the electoral college.
So maybe this is a debate bump How's the campaign looking to capitalize on this momentum?
"Right, yeah, we did certainly see that."
" Well, hello Arizona."
Let me sing that song.
This race is different.
I know I threw a ton of numbers at you right there.
Carol.
"I'm going to bring him in tonight, but the scene has been described as chaotic."
This is an apples to apples comparison.
Trump is beating Biden in the state of Wisconsin.
I think he won.
All the people talk.
"Okay, we don't have time for that."
"Trump heard and was like, He is?"
We just highlighted it.
"But when you look at the early vote numbers, it looks like a disaster."
And that's what you're going to continue to see.
I have one child.
Here's a live look from the Kamala Harris rally in Las Vegas.
"Again, all of these efforts aimed at trying to make sure that there is no doubt sowed in the election outcome here in Georgia, particularly in light of what happened here in 2020."
We know that Shapiro is a big advocate for protecting abortion rights over in the Senate.
"I think they say, oh, it was only at 48 years."
I feel like I'm home and I am happy and proud to be an American.
"Adams, who has long been an advocate for digital privacy and cybersecurity, supports Harris' policies on data protection and online security."
"It's unfortunate, but Bartos, he seems to be an establishment guy."
Now what did the voters think about tonight?
"Second, the most populated and largest city in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, overwhelmingly votes blue, politically predictable."
"So Jake, let me begin with you, the Trump campaign this morning."
What we say and the messages we send have an impact in the real world.
"Thank you so much, Jake."
Now we have some new polling data out of Michigan.
Don't just attack somebody for telling you.
"The stereotype of Democrats as smug, elite jerks who think they're too smart to listen to anyone outside their silo."
And then we have the dissenter.
Same thing.
Now he said Democrats complaints are a reflection of their anxiety over a tight race.
This is the story of this person.
What are you hoping to hear from Trump in Tuesday's debate?
Pivotal.
"If why you're here, what you Bucks County just outside to cut off for Pennsylvania everybody get registered t country to save and I'm j time drove out last night drive to help save this co about this mission of get to save America?"
We also have to make sure that the system works the way it was supposed to.
"In that scenario, in order to get to the magic number of 270 electoral votes."
"remember what the number was 1,024th."
I cannot comprehend that.
And I think the mentality that a lot of people have against Trump supporters are not correct.
They have Donald Trump in the lead Atlas Intel.
What about what happened the last time inspired you to change your vote now?
Kamala Harris must have Pennsylvania's 19 Electoral College votes.
They do.
He said he grew up with nothing.
"The last election with Joe Biden and President Donald Trump, Black women voted 90 percent for Joe Biden."
So I would agree North Hampton and Erie counties often are bellwethers.
"I really don't, and people always joke about people who say that, but as a young person who's just a normal guy, just grew up, I've lived an okay life so far, so where I want to go and have an American dream and start a business, have a family my own one day, I don't know if that would be possible if we don't get back on track."
And it's not surprising that it's the first place that we've seen President Joe Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris.
"She used to love me, he said wistfully, but once I ran for politics, that was the end of that."
"Throughout the town hall, the border and immigration were brought up multiple times."
"She's worked on some big campaigns, right?"
"All those politicians that run and pretend to be something else, they think they're better than you."
Irrefutable proof that what Donald Trump says is the truth.
"In a related context, Donald Trump, during an interview with Musk, reiterated his belief that the Ukraine invasion would not have occurred under his presidency, while simultaneously calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky honorable despite past controversies."
It's more of a party that accepts big government in some instances.
Whereas Trump almost kind of invites it on himself where he does so many.
Perfect.
"A lot of it, right?"
All with life-sustaining energy.
"But regardless, the one thing we're seeing is that we have these battleground, you know, state polls out of these counties that have swung with the winner since 2008."
He says the GOP is screwed.
What did they do after they lose?
"The fire started on one gondola, which then spread to a second one."
And so that's why I think I have a responsibility to speak up and use a platform I have to hopefully push for a change and course on what has been unfolding across the Middle East for as long as I've been alive.
Are you sure?
"They insist they are not opposed to fracking, but that we will find better ways to capture pollution from fracking and to keep people safe and sound."
They wanted to support small business and the numbers were wrong.
"Chip, let's start with you."
"So right now it's all about doing those events, getting out the message."
"So they really do need to make inroads, top Democrats."
I mean we haven't gone anywhere.
"I mean, Obama won it."
"And then they start feeling like no matter what they do, no matter how many phone calls they make, no matter how many peaceful demonstrations they participate in, no matter how many particular politicians they write, that it sort of doesn't matter."
"At 7 30 p.m. Eastern time tonight from a president Trump will take the stage right behind us here in Atlanta, Georgia for a speech on the economy."
"Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz have begun a week-long media blitz where they will be interacting with media organizations and social media influencers across the country."
"What gives Democrats a bit of hope here is not only the work that Kamala Harris has instantly done over the three weeks in terms of all of the polling out there about bringing the pieces of the Democratic coalition back into an enthusiastic support for candidacy, but they also point to the gubernatorial race in North Carolina where the current lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson, who is a very controversial figure, is somebody that Democrats believe they can paint as far to the extreme in a way to also bring in those critical, independent voters, the suburban voters that Alyssa was talking about earlier."
So Republicans have to decide who do they serve Donald Trump with American people.
And this is one of your top sellers here?
"You trust her, she gets elected fracking."
Progressives in the party are rooting for Minnesota governor Tim Walz for his record on labor unions.
"Why do you think both campaigns, they're kind of ignoring Wisconsin, Nevada, but they're throwing everything at Pennsylvania, Georgia, kind of Arizona, but they're targeting Pennsylvania, Georgia the most because if you win just one of these two states of your Trump, your pathway to winning the presidency is all but secured."
"Diane Blake â€“ $500,000 Diane Blake, a billionaire philanthropist from Philadelphia, is known for her commitment to social justice and educational reform."
"So I still think the election can be decided, you know, at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. Eastern time, which is when it was decided against Hillary."
It's 0.2%.
"And if you could give advice to anybody who's thinking about taking their son to insurrection at the Capitol, what would it be?"
"So huge news coming out of the courts right now, the court ruling that they can't just throw out these mail-in ballots because, you know, they had, you know, incorrect envelope dates as long as they were confirmed to have been sent at the correct time."
You got to tell people we got to vote.
I found it to be quite bizarre.
But maybe not as close as some people think.
Damn.
"So the question about the whole polling thing and the tightness is if 2020 is the benchmark for what they're polling against, I don't know."
"He just continued to talk about what he was doing and I feel like that's what Kamala is doing for the most part because I have seen some other stuff out there, but for the most part I feel like Kamala is going on the approach of let me just tell you what I've done and what I plan on doing versus Trump."
He's probably not going to lose a ridiculous amount of them from what we understand if they were able to stick with him twice in terms of the black voters.
You know so interesting thinking back to that day being here at the anchor desk at that point.
"But tonight in her speech, she's expected to talk about early voting here in the state of Pennsylvania."
We had Secret Service.
"Listen, when the Republican Party decided to move away from the party of Reagan and Bush and Romney, by the way, people I had major differences with and instead adopt Trumpism, they gave up on any claim toward family values."
They can do it.
"That's a possibility, I guess."
One that's close.
Harris said he's talking about the fact that he considers anybody who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will an enemy of our country.
"And then she, like I said, in line with what I'm talking about with all these Republicans all of a sudden that are so friendly with her, Mitt Romney."
"Appreciate it, friend."
"That's pretty much all the Democrats when they're in control of states, they try and make the voting laws extremely lax."
"If you guys did enjoy this video, smash the like button down below."
"Think about what we had when Trump was here, and compare it to when Biden is here."
"It was a tree, all trees."
Apologies.
And I think Governor Walz has proven time and time again he's capable of doing that.
"We must, the Constitution is hanging by a thread."
They what do they say is Atlas?
But right here right now Donald Trump officially has taken the lead.
Former president Clinton is in Georgia now rallying rural black voters for Harris.
"It's a slow decline, but the thing about it is they are not going to do anything that's going to benefit black people."
But it's not just that side of the Trump spectrum.
"In 2020, Kamala actually had to pull out before it even went there because she couldn't even make the primary."
He actually won his primary race from his hospital bed.
Anybody who's about to beat down other people is a coward!
"But if you look at the legislature, it's the only state in the country where Democrats have one chamber and Republicans have the other."
Right now it's R plus two.
"But if both sides have the same enthusiasm, the Democrat wins."
"Many accused Obama, who was also the first black American President, of doing nothing for the black community."
"One of the negatives on this poll is that they interview three quarters are white, all right, and generally speaking, the whites are gonna vote for Trump."
"Emerson back in 2020, roughly the same time period."
"While that's the same size lead he had over Biden in May, things have changed."
Am I right?
"It's obviously if he loses, he's Scrittin' Joe."
"I'm looking at my own numbers, your own numbers."
They've weaponized.
"They shifted a portion of them down to Maryland, but the majority of them were lost and gone for good."
It makes no sense.
"It's a lot like, what is the way of the warrior?"
I was going to do a video.
You could even argue Wisconsin.
"So I hope we see another one, but yeah, we're going to do a live stream after the VP debate and hopefully another presidential debate."
We appreciate it.
You dare face me.
So we want to do everything we can.
"But this guy had a loaded shotgun, a loaded handgun in his car, and it doesn't appear at this stage based on what we're hearing from Secret Service and elsewhere that they view this as a as something that became a serious threat."
And he's mad at the media.
I'm U. K. Washington Aziza is off tonight.
It's one of those things you don't get it until you really get it.
Biden can't sink.
"And I want to talk to you about so much, including voter suppression efforts out there and the state of Georgia."
"Uh, what a what a crazy Thought that is though."
The brevity of it all.
"And as I said, with Pennsylvania goes Michigan, 65 percent chance for Kamala Harris victory."
"What up, what up, what up, y'all?"
"So Laura, as you well know, President Biden won Arizona by just over 10,000 votes back in 2020."
Number one is the whole world changed in 2022.
Trump was three points ahead of Harris in this poll.
So the target here today is on those voters.
"After everything else makes no sense, they'll go, and it doesn't matter what the issue is, housing, health care, education, paying the bills, they'll blame immigrants."
They're saying we've got record job growth.
Five out of the six were one in 2016 and Nevada is probably one of the most likely states to flip ironically just given trends to the Republican column.
And he's headed to Georgia.
"You know, hurricane season isn't over yet."
You want to say he won.
"Again, I'm not saying it's a guarantee."
Doesn't it seem that Trump has struck a nerve in Pennsylvania?
Now y'all care about gun violence when Trump gets shot in the ear.
That pretty girl.
Plus it's July.
"I would like to see a leader who is able to compromise, who can work with individed government and actually lead by example and compromise."
The East Coast side has a lot of more economic dynamism.
We know what we stand for.
And that's why we go back to talking about Pennsylvania and a couple of other states that North Carolina and Georgia are ones that come to mind that.
He almost sounded like Trump talking.
"Yeah, Barry, it definitely seems no matter what side you're on, everyone is unhappy."
"So listen, get in the comments."
Thank you very much I didn't have time to get to it But the Biden administration today announced it would be finalizing proposal to force health insurance companies to cover Mental health care the same way they cover physical health conditions.
That could be fun.
Talk to us a little bit more about the message that we expect to actually hear from the former president.
"To me, he's anti-establishment."
"There's also just the question of are the people who are turning out to vote for Haley after she's already left the primary aren't these people who are probably not going to vote for Trump in the general election anyway, whereas maybe some of these uncommitted voters are still gettable."
"The second thing is, I think she has to show the strength."
Laura Houser with some celebrations.
You see that there Franklin and Marshall.
"And we also know that as a result of this managed point, we are not able to see the injuries to the former president's right ear."
Sabrina is a national politics reporter for The Washington Post.
Time Magazine doesn't have a picture of her.
"Not great, according to the article."
"As a data scientist, it is awesome to see a project like this come through."
The global stage is a disaster.
"But major, I can say after traveling with the Trump campaign for the past several months now, this is when they are starting to target these areas."
Mostly the traffic posts and dealing with everything on the outside.
Voter fraud never happens.
Is Kamala's sudden tolerance for fracking believable or is it yet another line of bullshit she goes through just to win votes?
I've been working in politics for over 30 years and got my master's degree in voting behavior from McGill University.
It has packed a lot of conversation guys and these are some of the clips that have gathered on the reaction of what happened during Donald Trump's rally at Pennsylvania.
You know him as Dr. Oz from TV.
I noticed a very fascinating trend.
Remember I wrote it.
You just do so many things.
Something was planned.
Donald Trump is clearly in his station wagon.
She's an election denier.
There are snipers on the tops of roofs.
I really just don't be reacting to him.
I'll just sort of set the scene for you just about a mile from here.
We need more support.
"Harris comes off of a weekend where Donald Trump was in Colorado and California, two states where he is extremely unlikely to win, as we know, Vlad."

So how is the Trump campaign responding to all this?
"According to her doctor's report, she suffers from urticaria, defined as a rash of round red welts on the skin that itch intensely, sometimes with dangerous swelling."
So we got great news and also breaking news.

And tomorrow will be another one.
They had a huge lead and it's been cut in half or I think even more than half because 800 K now it's like three 50.

Trump went to the black journals yesterday.
And Pennsylvania has been relatively deadlocked for weeks now at roughly tie.

"Some people will try to take a look at early voting numbers, but that can really go awry."
He should have expected it.
90% of that stuff is straight up garbage.
I would hate for you to not be hearing me.
"Boom, boom, boom."
Has he made mistakes?
I never thought I'd say it again.
"I Lived in Harlem long enough to know that gunshots do not sound like making popcorn on the stove Where'd the blood come from So in theater in movies they have what's called blood pellets You they even you know people use them in Halloween It's basically a pellet of fake blood that's in your mouth and when you crush it the blood comes out To Be frank Small hands trunk would not respond by raising his fists in the air triumphantly were an actual attempt made on his life This was I believe done to try to Show his strength counter to Biden's fragility But I'm my god Molly you endangered girl You You You You You Y'all know the m-rec room etiquette peace you now tuned in the m-rec TV You Where's someone wasn't on protocol there are consequences Oh Spoke All right, we did not go easy Carmen, it's your boy Reggie current upset."
"Well, the Harris campaign stance is that they are still the underdogs in this race."
"But Kamala Harris, as generally her campaign has been operating, is actually operating in a proactive manner as opposed to a reactive manner."
I drove all the way from Maryland and got lost.
My opponent barely campaigns.
"The Republican presidential candidate was in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Monday, where he decided to abandon the Q&A session and instead put on his favorite playlist for nearly 40 minutes."
"So in essence, if they had anything on Trump, they would have used it in 2020."
And you can go back to Obama and Clinton and see the Democrats have done great things with the economy.
"Well, apologies."
Kamala Harris is losing ground to Donald Trump with less than three weeks to go for election day.
"Well, Caroline, thank you so much for joining us and we'll be right back."
And I suspect most of you grew up the same way.
"Oh this guy's good 1,024th that means essentially that I have more Indian blood in me than she has and I have done Unfortunately, I'd like to have some also Alina Haba gave a speech in front of that fairly empty crowd as well, but Who's gonna tell her here play this clip?"
Now please subscribe if you haven't already.
"And look, even though your grocery prices are improving, gas is going down slowly."
So are you saying you're more attractive than your wife?
"A keystone, if you will, but not always considered a battleground state."
"And even in a race like this where Republicans underperformed by, you know, around 20 points, still 50-50 counties."
Horrifically honest.
"So it's sort of if you're telling people you should feel better because of these numbers, it doesn't resonate, at least so far in the polling it has not."
And they show how these two campaigns are trying to gather more voters in this state.
Okay.
Does it feel like both campaigns are trying to earn your vote?
"And these Secret Service, they jump right in there while shots are being fired."
"He said, maybe we'll pay off the $35 trillion in crypto."
How progressive are you on making it a priority and righting America's wrongs?
I'm Anthony Hennen.
What is your secret to small business success?
He was black.
"That's a pretty compelling stat, especially when you look at how our economy are unemployment into the historic low right now in America."
So thank you.
These are more college educated voters.
I will see you next time.
"And, you know, the true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire."
None of you.
You're talking about 27 percent of vote being Catholic and they are breaking away from the Democratic Party.
And I thought that's what was so compelling about Tim Walts' speech last night.
Possibly.
We know she's not going to the Al Smith dinner.
The white house says president Biden or the Trump hat for unity.
"Ohio has a large population of evangelical Christians, many of whom are strongly opposed to abortion."
Subscribe now and stay ahead of the entertainment curve.
Then we'll just have to go through the same process that we did last time.
None of it is a joke whatsoever.
"It's really, really it's a really, really tight election."
We'll be checking up on that later.
"And that isn't what's happening here with Kamala Harris, but it certainly is really good news that the Harris campaign is up four points in these states that truly are going to be the most important."
"These messages are tailored to appeal to a broad range of voters, including those in rural areas who may have supported Trump in the past."
I also believe that to be true.
A Democrat seeking statewide office in Pennsylvania is not a fan of Gov.
It was a joke.
And those arrows still live in my brain.
That would make me jittery.
But fine.
I'll try to bring it up here in a second.
Yeah.
Allentown's a majority Latino city.
"107,000."
"But if you're a Democrat, you don't want to rely just on election day because if it's very high turnout on election day more than likely those voters are going to lean towards Trump."
Jennifer Barrasso thank you.
Integrity.
So that would be a bad look.
"Yeah, all the policies align with What we believe and he can be able to deliver it."
"I think when people feel that they're not being represented or heard, then you will find that people will make extreme decisions, which is obviously outrageous."
"Uh-huh, yeah, you see?"
"That's the scene in Butler County, Pennsylvania where there was to be a marathon rally of former President Trump that only got five minutes in before this incident occurred."
It's clear that both Pennsylvania and Florida will play crucial roles in determining the outcome of the 2024 election.
"Obviously, we know he was forced to."
Donald Trump calling Kamala Harris not a smart woman.
Do black men have more concerns than other men with their crypto?
I think it was last year or something.
Will it be a 40 point shift?
"And the other one I pointed out in the video, this is incredible, too."
Good evening and thanks for joining us at 11.
Also rejected the idea saying it's not sensical and it would have to be part of other solutions.
So that other topic you're referring to is fracking.
"Oh my gosh, look how many military people they have there."
"You know, we're still."
People put signs that are this gun or we have some of them actually spell the kind of a gun they have.
But Pennsylvania rapidly becoming the biggest humiliation for Trump and Republicans.
So yeah they're just not into Kamala Harris.
"Walk in, order your donut."
F of 52 equals 46.
"John Lee, David Flippo, we don't know the winner of that."
That's probably what's going to decide this.
"I mean, it's run by a person who's a retard."
Mount him to your wall.
Fast forward to now.
"The former president of the United States, Donald Trump, rallied at Pennsylvania yesterday, went south after someone tried to pop him up."
"I mean, you know, there's something, I don't know, my first grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, attended my law school graduation."
"But Senator, talk about this, how abortion and how this is playing out in your race."
And that's the only reason why probably I would not vote for him.
"They want to make, he wants to make the country great again."
And you could go down and you could look at the polls here.
"Even the Emerson poll, we can see here, has Trump up by two, which was a very good poll for Trump just right after the announcement."
Politics is a funny thing.
She was one of the most unlikable VPs ever.
We have oil and gas.
"But from the folks who are directly tasked with protecting the president, they do not seem to be viewing this as something that got in here anywhere near an actual attempt or something that necessarily would have even turned into an attempt."
It's way down.
"Why would you come here knowing that it's dangerous, that it could potentially be a dangerous place and all of that?"
So this Pennsylvania stuff is really the big stuff.
"However, we are still months away from the election, and the polling data can shift."
"OK, and the."
"And with Harris only recently becoming the Democratic nominee, voters say they want to hear more about her policy proposals."
But you go up to Erie right now and it feels and the reporting is very similar to what I was experiencing in 2016.
 Donald Trump is in a strong position to win the key swing state of Pennsylvania.
And that's the difference.
I'm hearing different facts.
"They're just totally forgetting about the, a third Democratic elected official in Pennsylvania said the campaign is completely flooded with money and they should use those funds to reach out to Asians and Latinos, Latinxos, sorry, Latinx, where the party infrastructure is non-existent."
They're the generic ballot in the House.
"By ensuring that mail-in ballots are subject to strict requirements, the ruling may reduce the number of ballots that could otherwise be counted for Democratic candidates."
A lot of people voted before the Oz-Federman debate.
"And they're saying he's sharper than ever, pointing to how busy he is campaigning as proof."
"Oh, it's a runaway Trump train."
What if it's the food and it's something that you think or have been told is healthy food?
You
"First of all, what the hell's the matter?"
Call us racist when we elect Trump.
"I mean, they're really leaning into the she needs to be introducing herself to the American people."
"And that's a good thing, because it means that people like him."
"Much of that, though, obviously targeted or is really being heard."
The borough manager isn't the only Pennsylvania official speaking out against Trump's attacks on the Haitian community in Charleroi.
It sets a precedent for other states with similar election integrity disputes.
"And I was convinced, too, that those kinds of trials and that kinds of thing, it's not going to have any impact on that."
And so that also continues to reaffirm that Kamala Harris is in fact in the lead in Pennsylvania.
And then there's easily observable reality.
We've managed to get all that done.
"So I just, I'm, I just, I can't fathom it right now."
That's what I'm here to do.
Here is what I am doing.
Peace.
Thank you so much for joining me.
"Yeah, thank you."
But I don't feel comfortable in supporting the vice president because of X or Y positions.
Why not?
"If there was just a couple of polls, fine."
They really did.
"Biden spent three days crisscrossing the state recently, marking the eighth time he or Vice President Kamala Harris have made a trip here since January."
"Whereas Nikki Haley, who has been out of the race for over a month, got about 18% of the vote."
"Vice president Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump, both in the must win state of Pennsylvania."
"Of course they've been wrong by, I mean, we've seen the final aggregate poll where you average out all of them be wrong by seven or eight points in swing States like Wisconsin in 2020 and 2016."
You try and zoom in here just a little bit.
Abortion is actually on the ballot right here.
This is a person that's literally real like he's he's nervous being up there He's speaking from you know the heart and I love it.
"Huge number, actually 21.9%, almost 22%."
So this is the actual envelope in these where the ballots are returned in?
Might have to do in part because he's not holding events that size.
It's been floated for years by various Republicans.
"Is there anything to stand up there and say, I'm proud of X, Y, and Z because I think for the world even he's become a laughing stock when it comes to our foreign policy."
"Son of an immigrant, single mom, growing up, he and his sisters didn't have much."
"Kelly Carty is an attorney, a registered Republican."
She saw Pennsylvania.
"So the Rust Belt, no matter what, is going to be close."
"With favorable polling data in several key battleground states, Trump's campaign is in a strong position as it heads into the final stretch of the election cycle."
"In majority Latino, Reading, Pennsylvania, brothers and barbers, Samuel and David DeLa Cruz, say the talk of the town is politics."
 Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged.
He always goes on and on and on.
Decisive.
"I got a blood test, right?"
Let me open this up to me as you're trying to figure out if you're okay.
"According to our polling, black voters overall are supporting Harris at the same rate as they did for Biden in 2020."
"So they're off by, you know, two to three points, but insider advantage is relatively speaking a good pollster."
That's a good deal.
We're ready for a better story.
"In 2022, they started a war."
"They've got it within a point in the past, like five elections."
That makes a lot of sense.
"Now, Josh Shapiro is and he's pro-Israel."
Let's continue our coverage with CBS Philadelphia's Josh Sanders.
"Yeah, in one day they went from 67% of the returns to not even 66%."
"Trump's GOP approval in Pennsylvania, 77 percent."
And any new music on the horizon?
Green's donation reflects her hope for a future where environmental sustainability is at the forefront of national policy.
"In a lengthy and incoherent post, Trump claimed that McDonnell was nothing more than a grandstander and lamented the failure of his plan to turn Nebraska into a winner-takes-all state."
"Hell, you could argue she's up by a point."
"That is not good for Harris because if you're a Democrat, especially from Suffolk, you want to be up by five six seven eight points from Suffolk."
This is something only Henson can offer because of their precision manufacturing shop that also makes aerospace parts.
She's doing really well in polling data relative to Biden and arguably just relative to general Democratic performance.
"There is strong opposition to Kamala Harris's approach to energy independence, particularly her ban on fracking and push for green energy policies, with critics warning these moves could harm the economy."
I'm hopeful.
Kamala Harris received 52% of the vote and Donald Trump 48%.
They're down about 50 percent voter registration.
The only poll after she became the nominee has her up by two.
He's just not right.
It was huge Democrat leads.
"What actually went on there, in your opinion?"
"Like you probably be out there with Joe Biden over Hebra beach and Delaware, which is right there."
"And I think as Ruben mentioned, Sisepueda, but as Ruben mentioned, you need to make a plan."
They finally switched party affiliation.
What do you think we're going to see?
"So I hope Elon Trump, RFK Jr. is going to be the dream team to make us healthy again, man."
So I guess this is the Kamala that we've got.
That ends today.
When you're here at the county fair and you've got to stand and you're doing it one to three voters at a time.
 closing in on a decision.
"Yeah, he's probably the clear favorite at that point."
 It is good to be back.
"The Brett Baer interview, of course, is like that was another opportunity to like decide to be honest."
"So what would a the question is, I'm going to bring it up again."
"Usually their early polls have underestimated Trump significantly, but you look at the past three polls in the state of Pennsylvania."
I need to see that where they're putting security now.
"And that's wild, that's never been witnessed."
"Is this debate going to happen, do you think?"
And then obviously things shifted there.
"Yes, Democrats are dominating early voting in Pennsylvania, but Republicans often make up ground on election day itself."
I think it's a little weird if you don't mind me saying it's.
"We are going to crisscross this commonwealth talking about the stakes of this election, talking about how our fundamental rights and freedoms are on the line."
"So that means compared to 2022 Republicans have already requested more mail-in ballots than the entirety of 2022 in Pennsylvania while Democrats they haven't they're going to obviously but Republicans already cracked 300,000."
"And ultimately, DeSantis lost by like 19."
Both candidates are campaigning in Pennsylvania this week.
The shooter is dead.
"US, Vice President Kamala Harris is gaining ground in key Sun Belt swing states, according to the latest NYT-Ciena college polls."
So the question is not whether or not we need to do some things different.
"And as long as they know those differences, whether it's on voting rights and democracy or women's rights or workers rights and on big economic issues like tax policy, I think we're going to do OK, but they seem to be unsure of how to how to make the argument."
"You know, we had these, we would have these meetings where all of the Democratic centers would get together for lunch."
"In the hospital, I had a black, an African doctor, and he worked very well."
"And because of them, we ended up with some good music, right, right?"
The three things she's looking for competence character and core values and she has to have a personal connection and relationship with that person.
"What that is saying is that this is a population that needs to hear more, and she's responding to that need by answering the call and putting out an agenda and saying, here I am, ask me questions, I'm ready to serve you."
"Hit subscribe, let's get to three million subscribers together, thank you so much for watching."
This is the aim crowd trying to make sure they stay the aim crowd I say it's time to upset the apple cart.
And that's what she's going to keep hammering home.
"Challenge them on the, these are racist."
They're going to check the box for Haley probably around 30 40% of her voters probably are Republicans and pretty much all of them likely will come home to Donald Trump or maybe already have doesn't change the fact that Democrats are meddling in the Republican primary even though Haley dropped out.
This is not a huge lead for Harris whatsoever.
"Okay, you've taken an interesting approach to this."
"His contribution is aimed at ensuring that Harris has the resources to implement her economic policies, which Lin believes will create a more equitable economy."
"For your next member of Congress from the 6th District, Kirsten Engel."
And I think both campaigns realize that.
"Then in 2020, Joe Biden's 2.5 point victory marked the first time that Nevada voted to the right of the nation since the start of the 21st century, as Biden won the national popular vote by 4.5 points."
So here are the results.
Why are they mad?
"Over in Chicago, delegates are arriving for this week's Democratic National Convention."
What does it mean to you that he's willing to come back after what happened last time?
"Well, do you care more about the election now?"
And this has consequences.
"I know it's trying to be relatable, but I don't really enjoy it."
"This campus, the same poll back in 2020, they found Biden up by 37 points."
He understood how to sell it.
He's a great guy.
But I think the real news is that the Democrats should be in other states.
Thank you Pennsylvania.
That's a huge amount of money going to our kids.
You know what We might uncover?
"Republicans around the country have come out against the former president dealing with primary opponent, negative ads and even death threats."
We're offering you an alternative.
"Trump complained, as if Kimmel's reading of his post was some form of personal attack."
"If you're craving bold commentary, deep analysis, and actionable insights that challenge the status quo, this is your go-to political guide."
Fight.
Glad to be here.
"Seeing as a three percentage points means, yeah, it's in the margin of error."
"The point is, I was just picturing it, The point is, if you elect Kamala and Tim, they will not be focused on their problems, they will be focused on yours."
And that's what we're seeing from that.
"And after he was rushed off the stage with blood in his face, a spokesperson said Trump is fine and this is a heinous act."
This is not what this country needs.
I just say vote for vote for America.
"Yeah, if you look at the history of Pennsylvania, seven of the last eight presidential elections, Pennsylvania has gone to the Democrats in 2024."
I cannot stress to you how close this election is y'all.
Harris is proving to be a formidable opponent.
He was a veteran.
So I'm happy happy story.
"Tell act in all, tell by the way, that's going to blow up on her because Trump is playing dodgy, you know, and you watch how this is going to, Trump will destroy her in a debate."
"Like my in-laws, they like to watch actual cable television and like sitting there, being bombarded with those ads is maddening, especially, I think when we're watching the Phillies game, every single commercial break is just, it's literally Trump ad, Kamala ad, Dave McCormick ad, Bob Casey ad, then whoever the congressional candidate is, I'm like, I'm gonna lose my goddamn mind."
How many of you have voted for Donald Trump?
It's not even agreeing on what's happening.
Or you can go to Rumble if that's your thing too.
"Well, neither does Trump at this point."
"And here on our map, it gets marked down as Safe Democrat adding 10 more electoral votes to the Harris tally."
With 61% backing him compared to just 28% for Harris.
So there's a lot to really look forward to in regards to this election.
"Now people get so offended, you know, this thing right here, this is the reason why politicians behave the way they behave."
He may even have some supporters who feel more strongly about him than they do about Kamala Harris.
"But I think what you really need to see on an economic message is something that speaks to the middle class, strengthens our union jobs and our unions in general."
What approach do you think would be the best path forward for her right now?
They have no evidence of that at all.
"I was in the crowd on July 13th on that front left side, right between the shooter and President Trump."
So let's steal from The New York Times right here.
"And as the Biden Harris headquarters pointed out on the right, this is Donald Trump spending today bragging about ending Roe v Wade on the left."
It doesn't matter what happens in Michigan.
That's a nine point error.
It's hyper taxation.
"While Biden won Lackawanna County by nine points in 2020, it's easy to find fans of Trump here who disregard Biden's hometown connection."
"One of the key groups that she needs to continue appealing to is, obviously, young voters, including young black men."
"And for Roe v. Wade, what's the law?"
And it's significant because that was passed by a bipartisan legislature.
And it is scheduled to open up in those affected counties in North Carolina as well as certain parts of Georgia.
Take it with you.
So to me the only thing that I'm worried about in this current moment is whether that shooter was a person of color or not because if that shooter is a person of color.
This is a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice and a champion.
"A lot of folks who came here looking for more opportunity and when you have folks who are focused on opportunity, focused on getting ahead, focused on making sure that children do well, they tend to listen very closely to what presidential candidates have to say."
"Donald Trump, meantime, is going to Long Island this evening to talk about the salt cap, something that according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, actually 92% of the benefits of that go to the top 10% of earners in states like New York and California, not these states that we're talking about, Laura."
You see a bunch of co-posting.
"Pennsylvania, you're going to be hearing a lot about that state in these final weeks."
"Yeah, good morning, Vlad."
"Yeah, you have to run the table everywhere outside of Nevada."
"So it's one thing to show up, but it's another thing to actually listen and understand the needs of that community."
"We ask folks, Biden's job approval rating in our poll, 43 percent."
"Hello, Arizona."
"Obviously, at that point in 2016, we did know who was going to win Pennsylvania."
"But, yeah, let's dip it down more."
without Latinos and you do not win the presidency without P.A.
We're out here today in Pennsylvania head of this Trump rally Can you tell me a little bit more about why you guys decided to come out?
"When you hear him say he doesn't believe in DEI, what he's saying is he does not believe that people of color, namely young black men, should have access to capital."
"I mean, he was born in Pennsylvania."
"Like, why would they report this?"
We're going to raise a little bit of money for you and in return you're going to tow the line.
And that's really what they want.
And then she watched the June debate.
"Obviously, what's so shocking about that?"
I didn't I had no idea that you stayed in all that.
"So they are they brought out families that were separated during the Trump administration, their border separation policy."
"They hold up a mirror to everything happening in society, all those demographic changes, the economic anxieties, what we hope for, what we're afraid of."
"No matter what she says she's going to do for them, she's had nearly four years to do it."
"These states will likely be the focus of intense campaigning from both sides, with the candidates seeking to energize their base and win over undecided voters.In conclusion, the Midwest's role in the 2024 election cannot be overstated."
"You can't necessarily blame Republicans at large for them not doing so well in terms of running candidates who either a had little ties to the states or B just got ridiculously outspent even in the areas though that didn't really have any spending in Northeastern, Pennsylvania, in the New York media market."
" Well, howdy there, Internet people, let's go again."
Though even there his once-commanding lead has begun to slip.
"Great to see you, Ron."
"This is a chance to bring out that joy, turn the page and look to the future."
She's just trying to get the votes.
What happened there was they had a law in Pennsylvania where they couldn't count the mail in an absentee votes until election day.
"Vance on these quote-unquote concepts, they'll fall back on one final answer."
"There might be an ulterior motive, but I don't know."
"A recent Emerson College poll from October 1, 2024, had both candidates at 48 percent, while a Bloomberg-Sawanar Morning Consult poll found Harris ahead by 5 points."
He represents your values Is there anything that he speaks to in particular that really excites you as a voter?
"And today's Iris Tao brings us more from Atlanta, Georgia."
Charges are being dropped.
I will share my screen with you guys at some point.
The notion that the other side is worse than ours.
She was three and a half years as VP.
"Well, it's interesting when you talk about Haley voters, because we're kind of all trying to figure out where they go."
But we also know early this morning he arrived at an airport in New Jersey.
"And two weeks later, right here in the great state of Pennsylvania, Pow!"
"When they hear him make those promises again, they kind of know their BS and they kind of know that it's empty."
There's nothing normal about this tonight.
He is a Jewish American.
Do you remember how you felt at the time?
Things are going well.
So who would I say would be the best candidate?
"On the one hand, incredible strength when it is intact, what it does for its people to protect and defend their rights, their liberty, their freedom."
And I think that's really the folks that this campaign in Arizona will be wanting to do.
"So if you think of the song of Trump's sing in the hallelujah dancing to the hallelujah song, oh, it was deliberately chosen."
"Nancy, in our Georgia data, one of the questions we asked was, have wages kept up with inflation?"
"Look that way, three point two."
I'm a big Joe Biden fan.
I feel as though my perception of the media is they've gone away from journalism and now they're activists.
"Oh, I want to talk about IVF."
But we'll still go with it.
"Added Chapter Harris is also focusing on economic policies, aiming to boost job creation and support small businesses."
"But it doesn't really matter if Republicans are sitting plus one in terms of this, what Gallup is doing in their survey, because Gallup has always been right the past five elections in terms of party ID survey, which is what they do and the actual popular vote number being within one point."
"Barry, Dan, lots of good stuff."
"As the campaign gains traction and solidifies its position in key states, it becomes increasingly important for both parties to focus on key issues and to address the concerns of voters."
You heard Reuben speak a little bit about his life.
It's unfair.
"Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, a lot of push for him this weekend."
"In Pennsylvania, it's fracking."
As Newsom did.
And Donald Trump needs to cross 270 electoral votes to become president of the United States.
That's the payoff.
We losing recipes do you understand?
"Or maybe they'll be used for, you know, I don't know what they'll be used for exactly, but I know, you know, the government denied that they were going to do the long range missiles."
We are in 2024 and I've not changed that position.
"Of course not Pennsylvania can absolutely go to Harris, but these numbers are so bad for Democrats that it makes you really wonder how likely is it that Harris could actually win Pennsylvania because it's not just one metric."
People are outside.
CBS News campaign reporter Zach Hudak joins me now from Washington.
So not only is the vote share just weighed down but the percentages are just awful for Democrats.
And he's also a young Democrat who has ambitions of his own to run for president.
"So Bill Belichick's books will be something like, Eat, Pray, Grunk."
"Moving to the fourth poll from August 6th to 8th, conducted by Trafalgar Group, with 1,078 likely voters, Harris received 44% of the vote, while Trump received 46%."
I was not.
"By highlighting the court's decision as evidence of their commitment to preventing fraud, Trump's campaign can continue to push the narrative that the 2020 election was flawed and that they are actively working to address these issues."
"Some weird stuff, Senator, what do you when you see that?"
"Kamala Harris talking about cutting childcare costs, right?"
He's a whole human being.
"And if you like that, then good for you."
And that's exactly what the poll ended up showing.
"Well, Lana, this has been in the works for a while now, the Trump campaign wanting the former president to return to the scene of the crime, essentially, to show defiance in this campaign."
What are your plans to address these very important issues and change that narrative?
"So yeah, look, the security is high for the president."
"On the North side, when you go up into those suburbs that face over towards New Jersey, those are more magga-y kind of Republican, right?"
You don't need me to tell you we live in what I believe are prophesied times.
So you can see that is actually becoming significantly shorter and smaller of a gap.
And it's possible the polls underestimating him.
"Bible prophecy, gospel, century message, the Reformation and the prophetic events in Revelation 13, all of them are going to take place."
"To first poll, conducted by BSG."
His campaign is highlighting his past efforts to improve the VA and his commitment to the military community.
And that's why we're one of the battleground states and probably one of the most important states of this election year.
"Yeah, I live."
"White non college student, I think white non college student will increase to point three."
Because voters weren't sold on Trump.
"You couple this with Georgia, and that's that."
"Trafalgar, four point shift."

She's going to be tied to the Biden record regardless of what she says or what she does.
And that turned out not to be true what he was saying.
I think it'll be crazy.
Our votes do really matter here and I think that's the message that we're trying to send and I think people have been receptive to that.
"So social security as we know it as a form of, almost like UBI, not actually because we're paying into it, but as a form of UBI will not exist the way that we think it exists or that it currently exists now."
"I mean, the stuff that Harris said about the Knights of Columbus, for example, it is real bad."
I want the news so I can form my own opinion.
"The first poll was conducted between September 11 and 19th by the University of Massachusetts Lowell Center for Public Opinion, Ugov, among 800 likely voters."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
It should be very easily handled by the military.
They think it's okay so long as their side wins.
"Well, I think that President Trump is really focusing on bringing the economy back to greatness and making America affordable again and bringing down the cost of living in this country, including gas prices, which are still 50 percent higher today than they were when he was in office."
"And it's not just, you know, Philadelphia has a challenge."
How long do you expect it will it will take for us to know who actually won Pennsylvania?
They're going that far.
Arizona is a state that's kind of up in the air right now.
"Of the 435 members of Congress, Tim Walz and I, I think we're the 10 least wealthy members of Congress, right, because he was in public service, his school teacher in the Army, and I was in the Army."
You hate America.
"Bro, that highway was fucked."
"And all of our time, talent and energy is going just to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
Why are they the way they are?
You didn't think it was gonna happen right now.
Liberals try and say like they way overestimated conservatives in every single state.
Vice President Kamala Harris has an Indian mother and Jamaican father.
Her contribution is a testament to her belief that Harris will lead the charge in combating climate change and advancing renewable energy initiatives.
"Yeah, thank you so much."
But the thing about these places is they're also the kinds of voters where Donald Trump would hope to cut into some of those margins.
Everybody's very nervous.
But right now they're not getting the thresholds.
And I would encourage you to do this.
"Michael, it's more of a broad-based argument or allegation that they're going to continue to make, that somehow there's something not right going on, that something's going to happen when people vote."
And these are Republican voters who came out after they knew she was out of the race to cast these votes.
They're more affluent.
I'm going out on the deep end.
You look at what's happening in states like Kentucky with these extreme abortion bans because of Donald Trump.
That's what I want to see in the President of the United States of America.
"Look at the size of that advantage, right?"
"If you want to talk about the failure, if I had to guess, and I don't have evidence to say this for certain, but I'm going to suggest there's a high probability that the advanced team messed up and didn't realize that there was a building within a couple hundred yards that had rooftop access that needed to be secured."
"And I mean, I saw one the other day walking out with the refrigerator."
"So, you know, Trump probably wins the state by double digits."
I'm putting everything on the line to fight for you.
That's always going to happen.
"And the reason why that matters is because, sure, Biden and Harris were never going to win Ohio."
It looks like the road is pretty much so heavy police presence and it seems like this entire community has sort of been fortified after what just unfolded here within the past 24 hours.
This is Coattow and thanks for watching.
There's nobody leaving.
"They probably can't afford it, sir."
But what has happened this time around is because it is a very polarized election season.
That's when we're really going to know what the outcome is.
"And with Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Walz injecting joy and like to plans, it seems a lot of enthusiasm."
She finished about two points up.
"Although I do believe the mail-in balloting, you know, things have changed in the last couple of years for processing, it's no longer COVID and all of that."
"Her seventh visit to the western part of the state, Kamala Harris, used Donald Trump's own words to prosecute him."
It's down there to lawyers to represent the illegal immigrants that come into our country.
That whole city was dead.
"But you know, there is a shift happening."
"But for Amanda, abortion is one of the issues where she aligns with Harris most."
"Yeah, stop the count."
"Like, I know who cares."
"Trump at 54%, Nikki Haley at 46%, whereas President Biden in Delaware County at 97%, to Dean Phillips at 3%."
And that's the biggest problem with losing Pennsylvania.
" Yo, so we're here live in Butler, PA at the Trump rally."
"You can see even though they're oversampling Republicans relative to 2023 election, at least registered voters, Casey still went in by 8% there."
I don't think it's indicative necessarily of his actions in terms of Fanny.
"I'm Joey Mannequin, Patriot and in this video we're going to be discussing how Donald Trump is surging in the key state of Pennsylvania."
I want to get a little bit more of a sense of Harris's message for Michigan voters because we know that both Harris and Trump have spent a lot of time there in Michigan.
So it says new general election poll.
I want to start with this new polling that continues to show an even tighter presidential race than what we were seeing even just a week ago.
"And remember, Joe Biden had home field advantage here on paper, like he's Scranton Joe."
"The bottom line being, there are states in play for Kamala Harris that weren't even a dream to Biden, and this race is a dead heat right now."
"What is up with, I think Biden hates them all at this point."
It was Clinton plus six.
"He criticized her record on immigration crime and gun control, accusing her of failing the American people."
"And just when you think it can't get worse, she said she wants the government to stop you all from eating red meat."
We got to do something for the Lord.
"Democrats gained only 5,000."
You have told four congresswomen of color who were U.S. citizens to go back to their countries.
"Oh, absolutely."
But it's encouraging.
"Hey, folks, don't forget to hit the subscribe button and check out our daily show."
"Although the child tax credit, the fact that that even JD Vance is disingenuously saying he's he'll do five thousand dollars."
"But when you see these gangs of hundreds of young, usually young people go and attack an apartment store, a department store in San Francisco."

" Check one, check two."
"Your voice matters, and participating in discussions about the future of our country is essential."
And I love it.
"Y'all see it definitely prayers to Trump always, you know prayers to Trump What are you going through?"
So glad that we could get you on.
Who's going to win?
"Oh, he tearing up, boy."
Many would like to see helping Harris is not there.
They do not want to specifically talk about any of Trump's legal woes.
I'm gonna take care of you.
"So even though the voter registration numbers might be lower and the state might be becoming more Republican as far as registration, the actual vote totals are still favoring the Democratic side."
And there were real consequences to this.
Thank you for joining us.
"Okay, I listened to yourâ€”and then I read the whole transcript, too, because I always learned so much from you about voter suppression, about what we should be watching."
We won Pennsylvania twice.
Well we just heard from the vice presidential candidate J.D.
"for decades really and for the first Let's see Starting in 1988, which is when I wrote my first political stuff to the inquirer from 1988 to 2004 which is 16 years Doing the math."
"However, Trump's victories in both 2016 and 2020 by margins of 8 and 7 points, respectively, have led many to question whether Ohio remains a battleground or if it has shifted into the Republican column."
"We know that there is still debate over debates, the microphone issue and whether that will remain on, I'm told is still being negotiated with ABC, the network hosting that debate."

Welcome to VotingTron.
Have you seen him lately?
And he wasn't a problem.
"You know, trillions of dollars wasted, thousands of Americans dead, tens of thousands wounded, hundreds of thousands with the invisible wounds of war."
We've got ourselves a tie.
And these aren't just ancestral Democrats from Western PA becoming Democrats or Republicans now.
"Yeah, I think um Basically i've had discussions about it before um It's a lesser of two."
"So, it just shows that these are different strategies."
She lost it by roughly one point.
And I think there's been much heightened focus on Gen Z in this election cycle.
But ideally we know real real clear politics is already having a Trump win.
" Yo, yo, what's up guys?"
"And given the assassination attempt, sort of the the entire the strengthening of Trump's base and sort of the invigoration into the campaign ever since that attempt, I think that that's something that I said has become very symbolic for the Republican Party."
"If Michigan is sort of the 50-50 state, if that's the hinge on which the election is going to rotate, that's a terrible thing for the Democrats overall."
"And so knowing its history and knowing how close Pennsylvania has been in the past, in 2024, there is no expectation that Pennsylvania should be a massive state for either side of the aisle."
"It's not like voter registration is everything, but still you would like that number to be lower."
The damage is so bad and so it's been done.
Where do I start?
"As you'll see here, we have the New York Times poll from October 7th to 10th that shows the race being Harris 49, Trump 45."
"Well, in the last video, I mentioned the fact that he probably is, which is what it is."
You have in-state pollsters like Mitchell Research.
"If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing."
Other segments of Florida's Hispanic electorate are more divided.
I'm seeing it in rooms and union halls in my district.
"So they remain as it is, but it really is the seven swing states which hold the key to the US elections."
"One issue, if you could nail down one issue that matters to you the most, reproductive rights, climate change, the economy, being pro-life."
"This state has historically been a key battleground in presidential elections, with its diverse electorate reflecting a range of political views and priorities."
"Let's see, can we zoom in only on the comments?"
"If you recall, that's the state that put Joe Biden over the top in 2020."
It's a code.
"But, right now, they have Trump up by a couple points."
"And while we're at it in the race for president, what are polls from Pennsylvania saying?"
"Yeah, Gallup, they have a good track record."
"Just like or like Trump, people have a pretty good sense of those."
"And a lot of people thought, well, that's crazy."
"McGarvey said, and again, you've got President Biden talking about hope."
And the one thing I'll say is they kept saying about what I said right after the insurrection.
"Yeah, a lot of people say and feel they're still increasing, but Trump voters much more so."
"But really quickly, I have to tell you guys about shop.readegalpolitics.com, because the 2024 election merchandise drop is here."
We've got an Atlantic Ocean separating us.
Iran.
They will have this debate.
"Joe, following this week's Roe v. Wade Supreme Court leak, former President Trump did not weigh in on the issue of abortion, but he did acknowledge it."
"And last question, John, is give me your nickel tour of the of what you see."
"Tim Ryan, Leland, is clearly running in a way that is aiming to distance himself from the National Democratic Party, emphasizing his own blue collar roots."
So this Republicans know that they know that that this is a change in the dynamic.
I am going to go and that's fine right there.
"Well, we've seen it in the reproductive right amendments and state ballot initiatives in seven states thus far where they don't poll."
"That is I mean, he was in the way back machine there."
This is the home stretch.
"So again, this is pretty stably two points, even though it's sort of swinging all over the place."
"You stood strong with us and will stand strong with you, sir."
"In Wisconsin, Trump winning by 20 points."
"Like, for example, you see LGBTQI Plus for Kamala Harris."
"But it really does seem to be kind of coming into full view now that that's going to be the state, ultimately, that could well decide the election."
Take care.
"It got really bad around the time of the Afghanistan withdrawal, but even before then, she started to see a dip in approval, and she was unfavored pretty much nationwide."
So they're going to appeal it.
That has not yet happened.
She knew when they carried him down the steps that those were his boots.
But you could maybe argue with Pennsylvania Biden had home field advantage.
"Those are demographics that are a little bit more elastic, a little bit more swingy."
And that's something that she's particularly under pressure to do right now.
I just sit back and watch it all play out.
"This from Suffolk, a B rated pollster, likely voter 914."
"They're always going to move there so that they get that sort of like and that's what mansion has done, right?"
"Both voters remain firmly undecided, but newly energized."
"I mean, nobody cares about what Donald Trump is saying."
It is a majority of the electorate in the state of Pennsylvania.
It flipped back to President Biden in 2020 and now it's up for grabs again.
"And if Donald Trump just wins Arizona and Georgia, which he is almost guaranteed to win at this point in time, and he wins the state of Pennsylvania, Donald Trump wins the presidency as he gets over the 270 electoral vote margin."
"The Rough draft the final draft the final edit Um, you know, it's wild."
"When Biden would go on, he used to go on say we will stop Magga."
All right everybody saw the Trump rally where he was potentially you know tried to be taken and one or two things could be true.
"And don't forget to click the red Subscribe button below to get more of News Nation's fact-driven, unbiased coverage."
"That was a huge focus of the interview that she did with Call Her Daddy, this very popular podcast, particularly in the South and the Midwest."
"I just wondered if you would just share a few vignettes, if you would, from what this past year has been like."
Donald Trump was speaking at an NRA event on Friday night.
There is a heartbeat.
But we really haven't seen much of him on the campaign trail since.
"What do you say to those Republicans who simply say, listen?"
"He suggested that the Democrats' strategy of portraying Trump as, weird, could be effective, emphasizing the need to use irony and satire to highlight Trump's perceived absurdities."
Hey we've got all this money but we can't actually organize it.
This is not a joke.
"Um, and it was like updated in real time."
Donald Trump is someone who peddles bigotry and hatred.
Early voting is underway in a dozen states.
It is likely that the survey conductors believe they had an insufficient sample that did not represent a portion of Trump's support and corrected for that in their new polls rather than it representing such a large swing across the state.
"Well, that gives a huge advantage to Republicans."
"So even mortgage rates are going to go down, thank goodness, right?"
Trump returns to Harrisburg.
"Charlotte Morgan â€“ $5 million Charlotte Morgan, a writer, has been working a retail magnate, has contributed $5 million to Kamala Harris' campaign."
But I think what you're finding is the coalition that was built by Joe Biden to defeat Donald Trump four years ago is not tightly knit together.
"Political Enthusiasts As we edge closer to the 2024 US presidential election, the intensity of the race is palpable."
Have a wonderful day.
These are the final numbers not 50 days before Election Day.
"He's right back where he's always been with his inventive name calling and his very, what's the word, you know, it's almost like he's in his own category of politician at this point because he's so biting and entertaining in his own right in a way that just continues to ignite his base and to grow it, quite frankly."
Climate change is the single greatest threat facing our world today.
"I mean, you're running against this guy."
"Now, papers do, and you just write on a sheet of paper, concept of a plan."
"Uh, two victory."
I'm not here to give her any kinds of Opinions again.
You're right until the debate.
Same thing with Suffolk.
"It means that you're already at a majority and that people just moving over narrowly between now and the election can put you over that majority denying any chance that Donald Trump would win by a plurality, vote splitting, whatever it might be."
"From what I can tell, there was about 40 or 50,000 people that were there."
"You can check out more content from my channel here, and as always, thank you so much for watching."
"Kamala Harris, again, Kamala Harris is up to now when Hillary Clinton was really up four point five."
"They appear to move someone or something out of the way and now this crowd, this rally crowd, is departing."
"Wait, wait, say it again."
And they mean business.
The former U.S. president was busy on his campaign trail.
Revealing that Kamala Harris currently holds a narrow 49% to 47% lead over Donald Trump.
"43.49 for Harris, not much different."
We've been to so many Trump events.
Kamala Harris received 49 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 46 percent.
Tells a different story.
"You have Emerson, you have Quinnipiac, which is not right-leaning at all."
What do you think in terms of I know Trump calling for mass deportations.
And I don't play around with the constitution.
They don't want to do it.
It's a wonderful state.
"The first one is, does her campaign think she needs to get an even higher percentage of that?"
I think very possibly so.
America's ready to turn the page.
You do it exceptionally well.
"Like, oh man, you know things are bad when Dick Cheney is coming out for Kamala, Karl Rolv is coming out for Kamala, Mitt Romney is coming out for Kamala."
"And during the second emergency, Trump specified he actually meant Pavarotti's version, so that came on."
It's things like the border.
"I just, I can't believe how much he has bungled his own campaign."
13.
The president calling on Congress to come back to session.
"You know, he can get 48, 49 percent and still win the state."
So right now they're quoting voters during what is really a razor thin margin time for both camps.
"And what do you think the younger minority population, why do you think they're gravitating more toward Trump this cycle?"
It really could.
"We have a lot of natural gas, just like Saudi Arabia has oil."
"So my big three are climate change, gun control and reproductive rights."
I'm not talking about how this is nonsense.
That's a six point error.
He said he was going to take more questions than he raps.
We thought we'd get 37 in Philadelphia burbs in the four counties.
"So if the Harris campaign can't win over Philly, they're in big trouble."
We've seen massive polling errors in Wisconsin.
"If he's really winning Pennsylvania by two to three points, which, by the way, he's up in Arizona, Georgia, but we'll just say he doesn't win either of those states."
The good news is he didn't endorse David McCormick.
 We begin this hour on the campaign trail and concerns surrounding election security.
"Well two things first is we are flooded with disinformation like never before and I think it's imperative for everybody Penn students especially to To guard against being swept away by lies and stuff that is just meant to sort of pollute the atmosphere pollute the media ecosystem and You know look at the fact-checking websites for which there are three or four including factcheck.org here at Penn and PolitiFact Dot-com is another one, but that's one of the things that everybody needs to guard against to be good citizens But the second thing is that there is still time if you haven't done it to register to vote in Pennsylvania as opposed to where your parents live For example, this is just as we started this conversation."
"Okay, Congressman Chris Deluzio, thank you so much for the conversation, sir."
"In the show's part two that premiered early this year, Morelos got to display her singing talent for the first time in the series."
It did.
How will you answer that?
"And they believe that Joe Biden is sending people into panic, which is causing this, which caused the situation today."
We tend to have a lot of problems with Republicans on labor rights and how they don't really support workers.
"Oil and gas works in many towns, just like the ones you're here from."
"For four straight years, Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails and insane asylums and the worst mental institutions anywhere in the world, not South America, all over the world."
Same thing goes for the whole Madison Square Garden thing.
It's going to come down to the wire.
He leads by five points over Joe Biden and that's with RFK Jr claiming he has enough signatures to get on the ballot in Michigan.
So I think she sees this as an opportunity and a good one.
 And it's not good news for Kamala Harris and the Democrats.
You noted I had interviewed President Biden.
He's got his gold sneakers.
"Yeah, right there."
I think Oz is slightly better.
She just basically repeated everything that Biden has said in the past.
"But in addition to that, of course, former president was just here in Georgia last night at a rally just outside of Atlanta."
It's up to the artist to paint that visual reality.
Genuinely difficult to watch.
I'll tell you why.
Who knows?
That's why this is a big deal.
That's true.
Making sure their voices are heard.
"College students here at the University of Pittsburgh, black voters, white voters here in the city of Pittsburgh, along with Latino voters, that urban area of western Pennsylvania."
"And again, abortion is a big issue for me, don't get me wrong, but this was the biggest one."
"They're at around 321,000 Democrats as of now are below 800,000."
And I love to see the hustle.
We know it's a red herring.
"Tia, what's the analog to this in Atlanta?"
She's very left of center.
Trump's path to victory also runs through the Keystone State.
"But this also comes as our CBS News polling from this weekend shows that the script has been flipped in the last couple weeks since the last debate that Donald Trump is now seen as in the red, no pun intended, on having a weakness among voters about who voters see as the most competent and able-bodied to be president."
And so some of them called on him to drop out.
He's winning Georgia right now.
Would you rather have a 51 or 52 seat majority with cinema and mansion or a 50 seat majority with none of those with like maybe tester being the most conservative for Harris?
"There are indications that some Hispanic voters have come to Trump, some black voters have come to Trump, young black men in particular, young people, young men in particular."
People remain here for long stretches of time.
But I also think we're going to see the shift from Harris back into a more aggressive prosecution of the case against Trump.
"So far, a lot of traffic congestion right now."
"Some are refusing to leave, some are in tears, but this rally appears over Adriana."
We started with those early polls and now we're talking about like the future of democracy and the fate of the free world.
"And these are the counties that are in southeastern Pennsylvania, right outside of Philadelphia."
And you talk about the margin of error.
That tells you just how closely Pennsylvania is divided and why this is such a dogfight between them.
Anybody who says that they should be able to counsel my child in secret is a predator.
But nearly nine in 10 Trump voters say that it is bad.
"Silver bulletin model, Donald Trump, very slight favorite in Wisconsin."
He's the clear favorite even in Wisconsin.
Who here is ready for President Donald J. Trump to make us energy independent again?
"I think we at least we passed at least 3000 books, at least 3000."
He can do no wrong even though he does.
So those around Trump said that he has long feared the attempt on his life.
"I think folks saw the way Donald Trump did that job, which is why we kicked him out of office after four years."
The fire and rescue teams quickly extinguished the fire and all 190 passengers and seven crew members were safely deplaned.
"But I will say, as far as the work is concerned, I'll say be intentional about it because there are souls to be one for Christ."
"Another question, Joe D. What are your thoughts on the Biden hair strategy was to deplete the strategic petroleum reserve to help reduce the cost of gas starting prior to the midterms?"
One who's a seasoned prosecutor who's going to make her case and one who is a felon.
It's a direct message and they're trembling.
The buzz around Pennsylvania isn't just media hype.
That's our founding partner right there.
"They don't take us seriously, you know?"
"Well, you still need a bit more work, but it becomes a lot easier."
"And we've also seen Donald Trump be indicted on various federal crimes, not limited to sexually assaulting, being found liable for sexually assaulting E. Jean Carroll in a New York City dressing room in 1994."
Now listen this.
That is higher than the 51 million who watched Trump and Biden square off in June.
"You're watching Harris is outreach specifically to Latino voters with what is really the strategy here and why is that voter base so crucial, especially this time around?"
And so that kind of tipped the balance enough where Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania.
"And as Kristen said, for the most part, he did talk about economic matters, all the signage of the event that will get replayed as people see the clips are about his proposals about no taxes on tips and on Social Security and the like."
Vearing off is bad.
"Trump says no one is leaving, but widespread reports about people heading for the hills."
"We got to do more study, which is, which is cold for we're not doing shit because the Democrats been doing study on this shit for 40 something years or damn near 40 years."
So I know that you were Walts' roommate back in college.
"In 2020, who did you vote for and why?"
There were some awesome people there in her stay.
" Beth Leeper is a small business owner, former dairy farmer, and current beef and crops farmer from Westmoreland County."
"So, you know, for example, if this was the perimeter for Trump, something like this, there would be an outer perimeter."
"If the trajectory of the race though remains roughly stable, I would expect Trump to win Pennsylvania."
That's all.
And we're just getting started.
"He currently leads in enough states right now to get to 270 electoral votes, which is absolutely huge."
He cares about America so much.
"Nationally, Kamala Harris has a slight lead over Donald Trump."
I would not take these elections lightly whatsoever.
"Yesterday, he and his running mate, JD Vance, attended a rally in the swing state of Georgia."
"And should Republicans be worried that Democrats could say to these traditional Republican voters or Brian Fitzpatrick voters in Bucks County, hey, we're here for you."
"She's in Erie, Pennsylvania tonight."
"Olivia Jung â€“ $2,500,000 Olivia Jung, a pharmaceutical tycoon, has contributed $2.5 million to Harris' campaign."
That's a fact.
I know you said you're very excited about this pick and we see that packed arena behind you.
"Yeah, I'm not betting on any of them, if that helps."
"Pitt is one of few predominantly white institutions with such a tribute, according to its website."
So obviously the jobs are going to come back during Biden's administration.
"It's definitely the, I think, driving force for why I'm going to go vote."
I think it was more of a battleground state than it is now.
Pennsylvania is not a battleground state and you don't have to win the Commonwealth to win the White House.
You have to understand a lot of the whole low unemployment.
"For Rodney Nace, it's about Trump's track record."
"If I ever did that, all of those people back there, look at them, look at all those cameras."
"But nonetheless, we know that far more Democrats and Republicans are voting by mail in Pennsylvania."
"I'm the only one with these, sir."
Now we know the economy is the number one issue for voters coming up after the break.
"Today, both candidates are holding rallies in the key battleground state of Michigan."
They don't have the opportunity to make decisions for themselves.
It was also friends and coworkers and neighbors.
"Talk to us about how the campaign is utilizing Obama's presence and why having him campaign for her right now, of course, is so important."
"In Michigan, Harris 50, Trump 45."
"Ben, every time they seem to gather with their presidential candidate, they seem very perplexed and confused."
2020 changed our elections probably for good.
And it's not like a science that can explain it.
He had a pretty good upbringing and had a pretty secure life growing up just like I did.
"And JP and I talked about, and she raised the fact that Trump has literally said that if he is not elected, US democracy itself will end."
Last thing I wanted to ask you about is trump's vp pick.
"So that's Pennsylvania, that's the poll itself."
So that's a positive thing.
It's dangerous because she's saying that she's gonna give away things that she'll never be able to get approved.
Is that what motivates you to come back here?
Walk us through it.
Trump was up 0.2 percent before this poll came out.
Especially this right here.
" Mark, I've been excited to talk to you about this."
"All right, Danny Svalas."
I want to know what you think of her performance last night.
"We'll look for party unity, Gio."
"That's why you see a muddy draw out from the uncommitted national movement on messaging, because we understand what Donald Trump represents."
They're specifically targeting Rust Belt states.
"This is such a defining moment for our country, a dark moment for our country."
But we gotta form a commission to investigate it.
That's exactly who he is.
Do you lose on that basis?
"I mean everything is too high Everything real estate is high Like your house is technically worth three four hundred thousand and now they want seven eight hundred thousand Yeah, or the same house."
How much votes did Trump and Harris get?
And she herself has been out knocking on every door.
Donald Trump is perplexed by the concept that two weeks ago he was talking about President Biden and now he's talking about Vice President Kamala Harris.
"Well, look, it is a campaign season, so every statement is going to be questioned for sincerity."

"And while they're getting help, Trump, he decides to play some music."
"But his campaign wants him to say, get out the vote early here in Georgia, as early voting is underway behind me three weeks to go until the election is left."

"Pennsylvania holds 19 electoral votes, more than any other battleground state."

"And you can't really use the ancestral Democrat argument for registration data in Arizona the way you can in a place like Pennsylvania or even like North Carolina because of the fact that in the state of Arizona, it's a state that's moving to the left."
Pennsylvania is just critical.
I put it at that.
Is that is that really crazy to say?
No question.
"Harris also addressed the economic struggles of working families, outlining her plan to lower costs and provide more opportunities for Americans to thrive."

"Bush says in years where it's a tight race, as we expect this year to be, the VP can be very important, especially ensuring up support from key voting blocks."
It is Pennsylvania.

These are really good numbers coming out and we will see if that does end up holding.
What are they focusing on for November?
"But as I mentioned, it's about 44% of the Democratic electorate."

"Come and thumbs up this video, subscribe to the channel, hit the bell notification, hit all notifications so you have my videos in your possession each and every time I go live, I do upload."

"They've seen in recent elections, some very good luck with people like John Federman and Josh Shapiro winning in 2022, and then other circumstances where sometimes it's not as lucky."
And now he has a plan to turn America into the quote crypto capital of the world.
"I've been saying that since the kindergarten, during the middle of our convention, that there wasn't this great surge in enthusiasm."

North Carolina is only one of the swing states that did not actually go blue last time.
"And I'm just baffled that suddenly the police are the bad guy, and the January 6 prisoners are the good guys and should be pardoned."
"That shit is gone, dude."
"Allegheny County, which is in western Pennsylvania, that's where Pittsburgh is, accounts for 10%, or at least accounted for 10% of the 2020 turnout in all of Pennsylvania."
No one flip-flopped more in the Senate.
It was the only election of the four that the Keystone State went Republican.
"Whether it's the industrial economy, health care access, or social issues, the concerns of voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio will be at the forefront of the national political conversation."
I know my answer.
It could be longer.
And that's we have to respect that.
There has to be some true dire situations.
Well Trump's getting shot at so they're going to shoot at me.
The exception though being Franklin and Marshall which overestimated the Dems by 12 points in 2016 and 5 in 2020.
I've done that work.
"As Amar Moussa says, Trump is in deep trouble in Pennsylvania."
"In recent weeks, the in-state campaign has brought on new staff, which has given some Democrats more confidence, but they fear they're running out of time."
"Just to barely win the presidency and even if you get to 69, that's not enough."
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 49 percent each.
God is on the side of anything other than every single American.
It takes time to count millions of votes.
It's running ahead of Kamala Harris.
There was blood pouring everywhere.
"Moreover, the ruling could influence the strategies of both major political parties as they prepare for the upcoming election."
" Alright, so looks like we got some absolutely huge news coming out of the state of Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris."
He said she went from being one of the worst vice presidents in history to Margaret Thatcher.
I thought she did great.
It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day drama of a campaign.
Basically it's been we've been looking at cement for the last couple of weeks.
"And I believe that Donald Trump, for eight years, he's been attacked."
Polling can't tell you everything.
And what I've been hearing in the last few days in this kind of stretch across western Pennsylvania where both campaigns are spending considerable amounts of time looking at this state concentrated in that area.
Thank you very much And now we're gonna pivot over to CBS News campaign reporter Olivia Rinaldi.
Let's compare these polls from 2020 to right now.
"So, you know, it's a little bit."
"Okay, Dan, thank you so much for that."
"Dude, I'm going to be it."
We'll have to chat again between now and November 5.
I think Trump will outperform 46 in Pennsylvania.
"But when he then aligns himself with Donald Trump's extremism, not only is it valueless, but it then just gets weird."
Peace out.
"While he continues to boast about the stock market, the truth is that his own business ventures are struggling."
"There's a very high-stakes Senate race playing out in Arizona this cycle, too."
"And basically how it works is that if Biden doesn't win Pennsylvania, the chances of him and Trump going to a 269-269 electoral college tie is exponentially higher."
"And I think that's what is top of mind for so many residents, not only in Dearborn, all across the globe."
I wouldn't let it happen.
I don't know why that's the case.
Don't preach to me.
There is merch booths.
So it says basically we got these counties said decided already.
It's what we're going to have to pay for as Gen Z.
Where he could strengthen the ticket for Kamala Harris nationally is by trying to court the Jewish vote.
And I think that's what some people are worried about with the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania.
It's certainly a state that Vice President Kamala Harris covets the most and it's a location in which both candidates have spent an enormous amount of resources.
I feel it.
"Fur coats, non-fur coat, everything they're carrying."
"Harris has been outlining her opportunity agenda, which includes key issues like abortion rights."
That in itself might be the contrast they want.
It would be in line even with where near closer to where Obama got in 2012 than it would be to Joe Biden's 2020 numbers.
Their B-rated polls are likely voters.
I'm presuming it was taken after the debate.
"I just want more but Burgos who chairs the Latinos con Harris, which I think is gendered."
"It's almost like 6040 for Trump, which is pretty insane."
"So whatever color cookie they're coming in for, we're happy to give them."
"On the pathway to 270, Harris is 226."
What are one or two specific things you have budget Chris Cuomo?
"And of course, Trump is trying to take her back to her days in California when she was anti-Trump fracking."
"And here's how he explains Erie County, a mix of urban, rural and labor, a great patchwork of Pennsylvania."
"That's why Hillary was up over Trump and then Biden was up over Trump in Ohio and then Trump overtook both of them because the man, the day of gets counted after the mail and the mail and gets counted early."
"And with 45 days to go until the election, we have no time to waste."
I am such a PC.
What has she done right in the last 90 odd days that she's been in the race?
"But so Kamala Harris is now rising, rising, rising, whereas she also rising is the state of Pennsylvania relative to where President Biden was."
"And she's like, you know, I grew up in a middle class family."
And that's why everyone still believes that Harris is the clear favorite in Pennsylvania.
And actually Clinton under Biden under performed Clinton in this county as well.
"I'm just saying, you're asking me why."
"For Trump, freedom is getting away with stuff."
"And that's based on these two right here, Quinnipiac and the New York Times, which has Harris up five and four."
Trump's winning over 300 electoral votes based on electoral math.
There's no reason to delay.
You are trying to take everybody's rights you don't think nobody gonna rebel against you don't think nobody's gonna try to take that shot.
And we know who he would target.
Same thing with rising prices.
You already need a supplemental one.
Some sense of loyalty to somebody who couldn't get above 15% in the polls?
"We're joined by Daniel Malinson, he is Professor of Public Policy at Pennsylvania State University."
And this is just a just a simple question.
"The speaker warned of the growing influence of MS-13 gang members in American cities, proclaiming they pose a serious threat to public safety, thus requiring effective responses."
"Instead of being off by 10 points or even five points, they're off by two."
The tenth poll was conducted between October 7 and 10 by the New York Times Siena College among 857 registered voters.
"A significant amount of progress has been made in Pennsylvania by Harris, who is running alongside Tim Wohl's for the governorship of Minnesota."
The enthusiasm is high on both sides.
Police have confirmed the blast was caused by a bomb.
"ABC News senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott, Fox News host Harris Faulkner, and semaphore political reporter Katia Goba interviewed Trump on stage at the event."
And that is Kamala Harris and Tim Walts.
"Folks, how can you vote for this?"
"Use it, please."
So a number of you have mentioned the Supreme Court.
"Since opening in 2017, our goal has been to provide our customers with consistently high quality products, while also supporting other small businesses and our community."
"Not only is that cuckoo for Coco Pops, but that's like devolving in a way that is, that's more than I would have expected."
"Before we start, don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss any updates on this high-stakes race."
And you see Harris at 49 percent.
"Because if you say you value human rights, public safety, the truth, but you're willing to set them aside for what you think will be lower taxes and less federal red tape or whatever other benefits you expect to get from a Trump administration versus a Harris administration, if you're willing to set all of those values aside for those things, I don't think you really value those things at all."
But Trump is trying to change the tide.
"I mean, like you could argue it could go to Harris fine, but a Harris plus five poll is not it's not feasible right now."
"Key issues influencing Arizona voters include immigration policy, health care, and economic recovery post-pandemic."
And so he's not playing the greatest hits.
" Hey folks, Steve here in for Dollamore all week."
"The fourth poll was conducted between September 11th and 16 by the New York Times, Siena College among 1,082 registered voters."
Do you think he can produce the same results for Dr. Oz?
The state has been called the keystone of the Electoral College.
"He's showing strength there with white working class voters, with older voters, with black men, with the Hispanics suburbs around Philly."
He says CBS should have their license revoked for reasons even he hasn't come up with yet.
"As of right now, it looks like Trump is okay."
"So, we're back here again."
In my opinion?
"So already a three-point swing, it's reasonable to believe now with three weeks of campaigning with a VP selection with millions of dollars poured into advertising and marketing and funding, that Pennsylvania is far more democratic."
John Federman is a train wreck.
I just don't think it's going to happen.
"We're looking at for current president, Joe Biden has a 54 percent disapproval rating."
And the acknowledgement that the Harris-Walls ticket is that forward path is what's really moving people.
"Like, okay, it's better than Joe, but it seems like the enthusiasm search, which now it looks like it was just an artificial surge by the media."
It's been exciting.
"If somebody says, well, I'm thinking about voting for Trump because I remember the economy being pretty good, remind him why it was good."
And what the next 50 some odd days will do is allow her to get out on the campaign trail and share those priorities directly with the American people.
"Now, if you look at the polling right now, on the RCP average, as of now, it is currently Harris plus point four."
Because do people just forget 2020?
So that's a poll very favorable to Trump without question.
So I think that you also you're going to have to see individuals not only turn out.
"But overall, it was a good night for Donald Trump."
"Yeah, all right, Matt O'Donnell, always a pleasure to talk with you."
"But they're still being very savvy when it comes to these battleground states because as we saw under the Inflation Reduction Act, just in Michigan alone, they promised about $500 million to GM Motors."
"If you have a summer home, uh, in Delaware and another house in the suburbs of Pennsylvania, I mean, come on."
And one of the ways they do that is by attacking this acquisition.
"And then of course, they also use the whole part time thing, but no, no, no, we've got a great economy."
So my mother worked at a college up in Prescott.
"So Trump knows that if he wins here, he's on a really good path to maybe winning."
I've played lots of games offline.
"California, really?"
He's a genius at business.
"Sign up, get involved."
It was staged That shit was more staged than a Tyler Perry production of Madea runs for president.
"Yes, we are not buying this."
I think Josh Shapiro easily has the kind of pull where he can carry a state for for Kamala Harris.
There were solicitation charges related to that false elector scheme as part of the alleged election interference case.
This most iconic rally to come to.
"You know, she's shown that she's shrewd and that's that's a that's a valuable asset."
"Yeah, family influence."
However.
He believed in honest argument and hearing the views of other people.
You had to get wanted.
But now it's still a Trump lead.
But will these hot button issues be enough to drive tens of millions of young voters to the polls?
"So when we talk about it, Governor Shapiro out campaigning for the vice president today, there's Shapiro as we know, he's on the short list to become her running mate."
"Yeah, so if you were to look into a crystal ball for the state of Pennsylvania, you're going to look at it right here in Erie County, because as you mentioned there, Nicole, it has predicted who goes on to win the state and then on to the White House in the past few elections."
We have a 12 News crew that is tracking this story and we will bring you the very latest coming up on 12 News at 6 30.
"So in a nutshell, Kamala Harris is lying about not wanting to ban fracking."
"Yeah, yeah, I hear that."
"And when you take a stand, as I have and as Kamala has, to take on what I call greed, inflation, going after price gouging, decidedly in favor of a middle class tax cut, helping folks pay for child care, helping folks make ends meet, when you take on those fights, which are, I think, at the core of what people are concerned about, you're going to piss off a lot of billionaires."
"Anyway, go ahead, please."
" Yeah, this is the most bizarre Trump event I think I've ever covered."
It says evidence and litigation surrounding the requirement has indicated older voters have been more likely to have their ballots thrown out for lack of an accurate handwritten date.
And my opponent has not shown the courage to stand up and to condemn.
Basically saying it's going to be a much closer election.
"I was sitting at home, come down a golden escalator."
But already he's building a national fan base.
So this is what I'm thinking.
God bless America.
"And I think that's created by the political class in the media, which am I humble opinion or one and the same number far go any further."
It resulted eventually in him dropping out of the race less than a month later.
Thank you so much for joining us here.
"Looking at some polling that came out this week from Quinnipiac University, looking at likely voters in Pennsylvania, Harris is up by three points, so there's some work for him to do there, Gio."
This is iconic location.
"Now, I'm not saying to be a 20 point shift or whatever, but even if it's a 10 point shift, which I find to be very likely because, well, let's be honest, Democrats replaced the Catholic Democrat with someone that has a long history of saying some real bad stuff about Catholics."
And so that's what we got out of President Trump with three weeks to election day here.
I love my PC.
How important is doing the other things such as art important to our nation?
They're saying Donald Trump's weird.
"It's a key battleground, but it's becoming increasingly Republican."
You can download your games.
For the ladies.
We see that here.
"And in 2020, Joe Biden lost it by 2.3%."
Now he is here in Pennsylvania over the weekend.
"And like every new president that comes in to office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas."
She talked about reproductive freedom and how she wants to protect it and sign a law that codifies Roe v. Wade.
"Right, especially for president, that's a demanding job."
"I mean, you're talking about a state Pennsylvania that was decided in 2020 by around 80,000 votes."
But it's not just Harris who needs Pennsylvania.
"They're like, dude, really for me?"
So you were there on January 6th?
"As the election approaches, the focus on election integrity and the strategic responses from both parties will be crucial in determining the ultimate result."
He refuses to release his medical records.
"Now, our playlist would probably be better."
Let me know what you think.
What's going on?
It's only one metric.
"Bucks County was long represented by someone named Jim Greenwood, a Republican who was conservative on economic issues but supported abortion rights."
"You know, it is true that maybe all the polls this time don't underestimate Trump."
So this is a real weakness from Trump.
"If not, you hope that doesn't happen."
It's true because she's even less of a solid candidate to appeal to these people in terms of that demographic.
"It's definitely crazy You know to have people that wants to you know attack Trump and I'm gonna say this attack anybody No, you you literally I don't know what as far as like how far they going like, what are you charged with?"
You can see this is the updated count.
I'm going to go you all have a wonderful rest of the morning.
We are all part of the divine nine.
"This is my first one, I'm very excited."
Three months.
Brett Baier has been tough on Trump and I assume he's going to have tough questions for her.
Vice president Harris has already broken down a major gender barrier and her career.
"And as a matter of fact, the poor poor gentleman from Pennsylvania, Corey Compentor, he was just no more than 20 feet from me up."
Like dead people voting in Philadelphia.
And also back to Shapiro.
And it was great.
That's plus three for Kamala Harris.
"And I really, really hope that you're a good person deep down inside for humanity's sake."
Thank you so much for sticking with us.
You could watch the rally for yourself.
Did this debate change your mind in any way?
So I think that I'm not sure how many persuadable voters there are out there.
"If Kamala Harris is at 49% in the popular vote and Trump is at 48, she's probably going to be cooked in the electoral college, all things considered."
Did those jobs ever come back?
"So Reince Priebus, the convention committee chair, also a former Trump administrator, chief of staff, said on a Saturday night that the event was going to, was going ahead with guests already beginning to arrive in Wisconsin."
"My own experience covering a lot of Haley events, a lot of those voters were already kind of aligned with Democrats."
"I think once again, it's safe to say that in 2024, Pennsylvania will determine this election."
"Okay, so again, we covered that last week for you guys."
"And the Democrat in 2022 that got their ass kicked got 90,000 votes in 2022."
"In 2020, as the presidential election hung in the balance, all eyes were on the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia."
Guns and bloody throwing...
"Yeah, throughout the selection season, Bob Casey has had generally a comfortable lead."
"Good morning, Josh."
"I like how she brought up multiple things that she wanted to do for policy, and people keep saying, I don't know why she doesn't want to talk about policy."
But it wasn't just Michelle.
"You're only receiving a fraction of what other people, what you were supposed to receive, essentially."
"If I'm over there, I'm going to stop it."
Let's play it.
"People were waiting, including after the debate, thinking, well, at the debate, we'll get some specifics."
"So part of the strategy by Democrats is in a way reminding Latino voters of this policy that had taken place back when the former president was in office, controversial policy."
"Spent time there, amazing people, devastated."
"If Trump can't deliver us what we want on tax policy, but Harris can potentially with a Republican Senate, that's what we need to be voting for this time so that we can take the presidency back in 28."
And I know it's your shirt here.
"He's a dealmaker, and he never loses sight of the American people."
"So some of these Rasmussen was on one time, was off one time, it was on again, I can't remember the times."
"Nobody in Washington County is saying anything negative about the Haitians, said Sean Logue, chairman of the Washington County GOP."
"So now in this the home stretch, the final three weeks, when something does come out about a new plan for this group or a new plan for that group, it doesn't resonate because people don't believe it."
Polls of Pennsylvania in the presidential race are even closer.
"Grunlike in 2020, when the pandemic limited campaign activities, the Harris campaign has been able to enhance its ground efforts."
Who do you think will take Pennsylvania in 2024?
Let me show you this.
I was did a little bit of digging and I'm just going to show you really quickly a poll from back in 2020 where Quinnipiac was around this time.
"Trump really didn't, and she got under his skin, and she knew how to do it, and it worked."
"And the real reason, the real vote siphoner wasn't Jill Stein, but it was, what's his name?"
"And I think as Ruben mentioned, you need to make a plan."
"You know, it's like we're going to be the word not going to be the divider."
I have not had the chance to look through the whole thing.
"I will tell you, if you haven't done it, it's a crazy."
Is it a charming moment or a sign he's unstable?
"While Trump performed well in some suburban areas in 2016, particularly among non-college-educated voters, the 2020 election saw a shift among college-educated voters, particularly women, toward the Democrats."
"And of course, it's Bloomberg."
"Hey, man, I hope this is the tide turns."
"And when he was presented even with bipartisan legislation to try to stop the proliferation of guns, he did nothing."
"The point is, I was just picturing it."
"If you do, make sure to like this video and subscribe to Global News Network for more content like this."
This is the destruction of women.
"By showing that they can achieve such victories, Trump's campaign can push for similar measures in other states, which could influence the overall election landscape."
My heart is singing so loudly.
"Chip, I want to tap into your Democratic strategist background here with Harris seeming to face a bit of a dilemma."
Friday rolls around.
"I, with my husband Brian, own and operate a direct-to-consumer on-the-farm market, featuring beef that has been raised on the family farm in Donegal, PA. We procure lamb, chicken, and pork from other small farms in Pennsylvania like ours, and all the animals are harvested through local processors to our specifications."
I literally got to the end of this part of the line.
"I mean, I know they can mention fracking."
"He is us, and we are him."
"Kathleen, welcome to the show."
She is a far-right activist who ran unsuccessfully for Congress.
And the campaign has really made an emphasis of courting these voters on economic issues in the suburbs of major cities.
"Think about what you want for your country, what you want for the kids."
Kamala don't know.
The point of a town hall meeting is to take questions.
That's one example of different views of what is and what's going on.
"For some reason, the governor of South Dakota who killed her dog, Kristi Noem, is the one asking Donald Trump questions."
I think that speaks to his 61 percent approval rating.
"He ends up he ends up winning the election in total He wins by 1.2 So if he wins by 1.2 and the polls are saying about 4.7 he the polls were off by about 3.5 Now the Wisconsin results You can see here you're only won by 0.7 this looks really close to this 20,000 votes It's pretty crazy if we look at the Wisconsin numbers though, check this out."
"Pennsylvania, Kamala Harris has a four point lead, which is a very, very small margin because in any polls, as you understand, there is a margin of error."
"No, he cannot lose any of these states except Nevada."
"And for the first time being an adult, I've heard a president actually say that they care about the country."
"Here, both candidates are tied at 48% each."
And it does feel like a bit of a pivotal moment here as we're finally seeing Trump tied to a courtroom day after day.
"I'll tell you it's See, it's just a bunch of ranting and raving and cursing Take a look at this."
How can I make the most money?
"Yeah I mean it's what we've been saying now for quite some time that this comes down to Blue Wall, Blue Wall, Blue Wall."
And it was that Dr. Oz that beat him out.
This is the stuff you read about in history books never did I ever think in my lifetime that would happen in real time let alone read it on twitter sitting in a driveway.
We'll let the lawyers decide if what he said was treason.
"Now, listen, we've been talking about this."
"Make sure you're following, subscribe to whatever it is all completely free."
And it's going to be tight because a lot of Americans are struggling right now.
"He was pro-choice a couple years ago, pro-red flag laws a couple years ago, pro-mask in 2021, pro-jab."
It certainly doesn't seem as though any of them will Olivia Rinaldi.
"My brothers are older, so they kind of keep me informed."
"Do you believe some of the voters who went for Haley in Pennsylvania, might they have reservations about having a possible felon on the ticket as their nominee in November?"
I don't believe that that many people voted for Joe Biden.
"And so what we found here is with this lead in these three states, it really gives a sense of security to Democrats in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that sure may not and should not translate to a sense of complacency."
"specifically what's Western, Pennsylvania Well, I think really it's I you know back in 2016 I dressed like a slob and I didn't have any hair and I've been saying this is gonna be really close It's gonna be incredibly close when it was the secretary Clinton and here we are in 2024 and I still dress like a slob I don't have any hair and it's gonna be very close right now too because it's a very stark choice here and there and And now I do believe Kamala Harris is going to prevail on that but we must we can't forget that Trump has an appeal in Pennsylvania and we need to make sure we show up everywhere and we need to come at them and Make the argument and a lot of the kinds of rooms that other times people aren't even going to showing up and that's what I've been Doing and that's what I'm going to be doing between now until the election right now And but people understand who Trump is and I don't know why some people might have that kind of appeal But after everything that we've done and what has happened whether it's the trail or whether it's the impeachment or whether it's what to do impeachment or January 6 or even after the assassination attempt all of those kinds of things I'm not really convinced that this debate's gonna change and then a significant kinds of way Well, I wonder I wonder if there is a way to change it you say people know who Donald Trump is."
"If Pennsylvania goes for Trump, there's no possibility that Harris wins, which means we don't have to have World War III, which would be really appreciated."
This is not the future we want.
Harris leads this poll by two points.
"And the second point is, I just want to say hi to everybody in weapons 23 Semper Fi."
So President Joe Biden spoke with Trump after the situation.
"If Joe Biden was leading the polls in every single swing state, some swing states that, you know, Democrats didn't even win last time, and he was up by, let's say, five points in some of them, there's no universe that Trump would even be a 20% favorite, yet they make Biden the outright favorite even if it is by a narrow margin."
"Going forward to the third poll, from July 31st to August 3rd, which is conducted by Redfield and Wilton Strategies, with 743 likely voters, Harris received 44% of the vote, while Donald Trump received 46%."
Now these guys are not going to die.
It was a he and comes back a she.
I thought this was amazing and beautiful.
"With an ale-biting race drawing closer, an interesting popularity trend has also emerged in favor at up years of Kamala Harris."
Sixty five.
"So he goes on to say Oz wrote books, so he's good."
That I don't understand.
"The matriarch of a family of wrestlers, she opposes transgender women playing in women's sports."
"I thought that was a pretty good thing for the economy, a pretty good thing for America."
How they see this depends on how they already see him.
"But, um, and I said, no way if the man is going to be in my town, we got to do something."
"But either way, the fact is, despite having a big outlier, it's only Harris plus point four."
There's a lot more shipping going out in the next week for the blue cookies.
She's going to be hitting these blue wall states.
 Hello everyone.
"If she were alive today, she would be a Republican."
You think they liked him the whole time?
"Because he's been a president for what, three years?"
"For the other three, the decision ultimately comes down to character in protecting the Constitution."
"Obviously, Kamala Harris has managed to get under his skin and she's on his mind."
"While Biden was able to make inroads with some of these voters in 2020, Trump's appeal remains strong in these areas, and he will need to maintain or even expand his rural support to win Pennsylvania in 2024."
And that's crazy.
"Oh, no, absolutely."
Tim's a veteran.
And are you going to what's going on?
"Well, what she's going to be doing in Michigan is highlighting something that she rolled out yesterday."
"So many veterans are upset about that, including here in Pennsylvania."
There was no question about who these people were going to vote for.
And we actually got a Harris plus three last night after two nights in a row of Trump plus three.
And that's really why I'm undecided.
"My b produced a song uh, go to turnout here is amazing a say it."
"Again, the data is closed, but let's look at the real time outcomes, right in the race for governor, in the race for US Senate, in the race for president in 2020."
"WR's Noah Klein is here now with where she is set to speak and when, Noah."
Your bakery though is flooded with orders.
"These four battlegrounds have voted for the same candidate as one another in almost every modern presidential election, voting blue in the six elections between 1992 and 2012, before Trump then managed to flip Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, each by less than a point, against Hillary Clinton in 2016."
"Look, we'll see."
And you know the area.
I just came in from the swimming pool.
I really doubt that he's losing Wisconsin.
But this is what we're going to go ahead and do.
"When he launched a media tour recommending not just that Mr. Biden abandoned his reelection bid, but specifically that Harris should be the new nominee."
It's about the issues they care about most.
"It was very contentious, but it was a state that Republicans had focused on."
We're using the Democrat strategy of mailing with the Amish.
We've been talking about this for a decade and hasn't changed it.
"Thank you very much indeed, Ms. Liblong, for joining us and getting us that perspective there."
His refusal to play along with Trump's scheme sent the former president into a tailspin.
"But what we have seen unfold over the last 11 months, the number, the numerous war crimes that have been committed, we have seen a president who has been unwilling to distance himself from the war criminal, Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet."
"I think it's black women, and especially in this case, thinking beyond ourselves, it's about winnability because the alternative is so scary."
"The favorability ratings in Pennsylvania, 48 percent of likely voters have a favorable view of Harris, while 43 percent have an unfavorable view of her."
"Harris's challenge lies in not only maintaining democratic turnout in these counties, but also in appealing to moderate and undecided voters who may feel alienated by either party."
"This close result demonstrates that Trump is in a strong position heading into the final stretch of the campaign, with Pennsylvania shaping up to be a critical battleground."
I mean that meant lots of people.
"Maybe obviously the polls would say, well, actually, I'm not even sure."
"We've seen interesting, some interesting polls here where we had about three out of four polls that showed the race to be a tie."
Latino voters especially.
You had Corey Woods.
"In this analysis, we'll take a close look at recent polling data from these states and discuss what the numbers may signal for the upcoming election."
"But you know, I view inflation was the worst we've ever had."
Devastated.
It was around eight.
"All right, Nancy, thank you for that."
It's like the rules are changing.
Can Harris secure Pennsylvania and push herself past the finish line in this nail-biting election?
"Let me know down below Especially if you're in one of these states, it's really impactful like, you know, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, etc but super interesting to see this sort of growth and Genesis of the cup."
"So now, you know, you have this race that has just settled into it."
And it's very important.
"This comes as more than five million Americans have already voted early, including at least 415,000 Pennsylvanians who have already mailed in ballots."
It doesn't make any sense.
Fast forward to today and what do we have?
Let's stay informed and engaged as we move closer to the elections.
This is an illustration of why Donald Trump is going to win the state of Pennsylvania.
The election results the last couple of times have been really close.
"If they like what they hear, they'll offer you a deal."
It's like what's left?
Don't just read the headlines.
What do you guys think?
"As Barack Obama put on a stern fatherly act, he asked black men to learn from black women, whom the former President claims are against Donald Trump."
I think that's perfect.
Ave Maria?
"Anyway, this is Tim Wals camping."
"With favorable polling data in key battleground states and a strong legal foundation, Trump's campaign is positioned to make a significant impact on the outcome of the election."
He's a popular governor in a key battleground state.
And it's a big issue in Western Pennsylvania.
They're literally being told that Harris has to win because Donald Trump is going to take away their democracy or abortion rights.
"But even without Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Trump can still win the election and it can be decided by about 2 a.m. with a call by all the major networks."
It's a tough one.
Nevada probably his.
"Now, he's kind of been in the shortlist for a while now."
The links are all in the description down below.
 Former President Trump also in Pennsylvania last night making his pitch to voters at a town hall event that took an unusual turn Senior national correspondent tremor and has the details.
And there's a lot of them.
"What does it say, um, about, about this ticket's working class appeal that even, even though he was endorsed by the leadership of the organization that he was speaking at, the rank and file were clearly hostile to his campaign."
"But another race where you had a blind spot was North Dakota, where you did see Rick Becker, who was just objectively the America first anti-establishment candidate, even pro-Trump candidate."
It's beautiful.
And God bless America.
I hate to say this because I say it all the time.
"You know, 27 percent of the people say they don't have enough information about Kamala Harris."
But either way we're gonna get into this.
And they all say one thing.
Has voter sentiment changed?
Shapiro will be there tonight.
"Well, there is a brand new poll released out of Notre Dame, you know, a very Catholic university."
You've got the Pennsylvania mainline suburbs.
"On the other hand, the Democratic Party may face increased pressure to address concerns about election security and to articulate their position on these issues more clearly."
This guy.
"Joe Biden, now they're trying to say, well, he's a convicted felon."
"To run as a change candidate, you have to actually offer something different."
"Beyond the immediate implications of the ruling itself, there are broader political and strategic consequences that could impact the election."
Are you ready to go?
He actually hasn't been to Allegheny County at all.
And I think she has the capacity to do that with her small business programs and her commitment to put a Republican in her cabinet.
"As inflation and interest rates are coming down and the stock market hitting another all time record high today, the Dow up 200 points closing for the first time above 43,000."
"And let me tell you something, I ain't going back."
They're going to be involved directly in the war.
"In addition, he stressed the closeness of the race as well as the critical role that voter turnout will have in the outcome of the election."
"The beginning paragraph here in this article says when Vice President Kamala Harris ruled out her economic agenda, she went to Pittsburgh."
"Now, ever since she started this back in 2020, when she ran for president the first time, if you guys didn't know, yes, she has already run for president and it didn't go well at all."
But it's the where those votes came from that I think is particularly important.
"For one, the economy is top of mind for many voters."
"Well, speaking of New York, the weather this week has been crazy."
And people bought it up because he was an unknown commodity.
"But anyway, I thought to myself, I wonder if she ever told come on, uh, Willie Brown to say it to her face and do that."
There was one Harris waltz.
And I think it's great for America.
Her significant donation reflects her confidence in Harris' ability to lead on labor issues and promote economic justice for all workers.
It's like trying to nail jelly to a wall.
"Well, it sounds like you're trying to do the right thing."
 Democrats are facing a potential disaster in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.
What does she think she's like Trump or something.
"Angelik, born and raised in the Lehigh Valley, a public school teacher for now 25 years."
"There go if the polling is one point left now, Harris is still up in the national popular vote."
He allowed people to go back to work too soon.
"But he hasn't had events that big in recent weeks, so there'd be no way to mention it."
I'm very excited.
"I mean, they've been repelled by Trump because of abortion, because of J.D."
"And by the way, if you were a betting person, Jenna Ellis would have been the ideal person to come forward early because she's already done so in other cases."
Thank you very much
It's basically like a 95% chance you win because it's 19 electoral votes and the way the maps put together.
"Both parties are expected to invest heavily in campaigning in Pennsylvania, recognizing its potential to decide the next president."
I think it's important to remember that we are voting for the leader of our country and not who we like the most Or who we want in our wedding party But who is actually going to make our country better and we're in an incredibly unique situation Where we've had both of the candidates in office before and we've gotten to see what they do and when facts come to facts My life was better when Trump was in office.
And Pennsylvania's do not believe Kamala Harris will not come after fossil fuels.
"After taking our road trip to Hollywood for a check in with none other than actor and political activist, Kerry Washington."
"The outcome in Pennsylvania could very well determine the next president, making it a battleground state that will continue to draw national attention."
"Even 2016 same thing occurred September 2nd, 2016 or September 3rd."
"I mean, it is somewhat bizarre and I would think she would want to be there."
"So the governor's office, the House and the state Senate, they protected abortion rights."
He ended up winning only by about 1.2 So you have to be aware of that error And so I think she really needs to get this number up if she wants to win I think she will I think the DNC boost would probably kick in and there'll be some of those kinds of boost still out there But you know what we can see if we go down these polls A lot of these polls don't actually contain him But like this signal poll has him at 2% which is really significant like 2% is absolutely massive.
Now this is of no surprise because I've been following Kamala and her national political aspirations for a while.
So that's what happened there.
"The unselect committee on January 6th, did you see where they went and deleted and destroyed all evidence, was deleted and destroyed?"
"I mean, one of the most disturbing things about this election and Donald Trump's rise in politics is how we seem to have set aside the values that people like John McCain stood for."
"Someone says you know they're concerned about reproductive health care, you want to talk about Kamala Harris' opinions on that."
They should be at 65% of the total.
"We're turning to the site of that assassination attempt on his life and that's another like X factor in all of this, whether that helps to drive local enthusiasm for Trump."
"And of course, she has her E.V."
"With that as a backdrop, the vice president has no choice other than to make that choice today or tomorrow."
But she wants just factual information.
Why does Erie matter so much?
We got Trump trash cans.
That's right.
"Nationally, I think his ceiling is probably 46% this time around with all the third party candidates."
The 11th poll was conducted by Morning Consult between September 19 and 25 with 993 registered voters.
And Republicans are looking to win this district.
"Right now, inflation and prices are up, wages and savings are down under the disastrous policies of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden."
I could be in a gorgeous beach somewhere in the world.
And so Kamala Harris now narrowing down even pre-VP selection in Pennsylvania goes to show that Democrats are in a far better position.
Brett tends to be tough on Trump.
"They take, if somebody has two or three jobs, that counts towards lowering the unemployment."
Now they got an important role to play in making sure Kamala Harris is the next president of the United States.
"And so Pennsylvania now turning into a state where Kamala Harris is either up, or according to this Republican pollster, I think that is the most really impactful part of this all, is that Republican pollsters and polls sponsored by the GOP typically come back with more favorable results."
Bob needs our help.
"According to the Cook Political Report, Pennsylvania is one of six toss-up states in the 2024 election and in 2020, Biden, as you know, won PA and in 2016, Trump turned the state red, pulling off a win against Hillary Clinton."
I'm excited to see if David Bremmer will be here.
And that's kind of what we see here.

I've walked the floor.
"And, you know, it's just, we work hard to make, make a dollar and the dollar isn't even the dollar nowadays."
That was from a campaign that was having problems.
I love to hear that.
"That is a survey of 170,000 people getting their opinions, sometimes reported, sometimes unreported crime."
We only have one itsy bitsy teeny weeny problem.
"So who do I trust insider advantage, which has a a decent track record, not perfect, but it's all right or Suffolk, which is a garbage pollster that doesn't know how to pull out of Pennsylvania and they they dropped a Harris plus three here, which is actually an improvement for Trump compared to 2020 and 2016 or I trust insider advantage."
"Now, he's obviously been in Pennsylvania a lot and Trump is somewhat kind of omnipresent and he's never off your TV."
"Well, I hate to be so crass, but the interview was a train wreck."
This is not 2012 anymore.
"All right, Linda."
But having the endorsement of President Trump has been huge for him.
"That energy is something that's worth a little bit at the end here, and that's why, as I said before, I'd much rather be us than them."
"Pennsylvania, with its 19 electoral votes, has long been a pivotal state in presidential elections."
So our goal is really to just support candidates both locally and on the national level that represent our values.
Niggas is missing now what what the fuck going on?
"Over $100,000 is the biggest poll group that they polled, $100,000 of income."
"In fact, I actually believe compared to 2020 and 2022, you will see more Democrats vote on Election Day."
"Reg, wouldn't you expect to see the governor there?"
"Or do I trust Quinnipiac, the New York Times, Suffolk, Franklin and Marshall?"
And what's the issue with her?
"And since abortion is one of few winning issues for Democrats at the moment, that could be playing a role in these more favorable numbers here for them."
Some local high-profile Republicans are calling on voters to make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States for a simple reason.
Pennsylvania rocks.
They argue the county election officials are able to tell whether ballots were cast in time because they're scanned and timestamped upon approval.
He sees Trump's legal troubles as political attacks that should be worn as a badge of honor and is more concerned about building up a ground game to turn out voters than the fact that Trump is now in court most days for his hush money criminal trial.
"And I was like, Listen, I just believe in my heart that Trump loves us and wants to fix America."
The link is in the description and the pinned comment.
What exactly are we seeing here?
Let's talk about a couple of battleground states.

Today I make you this promise.
"She says in talking with other delegates, there has been an unusual amount of excitement over who this VP pick will be."
"Autocrats begin by vilifying the press, demonizing their and dehumanizing their opponents and co-opting the judiciary."

What exactly do we have to show for those wars?
They're putting it on their lawn.
She lost.
"So like, d last time or how did so money of his own."
Trumpy Trout will make you feel so good.

"Joe, I can't tell you how rare that is."
"Hell, Trump was not even leading in virtually any poll."
He doesn't care one iota about you and your electric bill or your water bill.
And those women governor were saying they were going to vote on that issue alone.
You've both been involved in politics for quite a while.
We will stop the invasion.
Just freaking magnanimous.
"So Bill Clinton is coming out and endorsing Trump, basically."
It's like it's ridiculous like you're not getting anything You're not going anywhere.

"So I feel this is for him to come back here, another act of defiance."
He's going to say that they all conspired against him.
It was a strategic move to energize voters in a state known for its political significance.
"Only one time, as you know, since 92 has a Republican wanted it."
"Yeah, and President Biden, as you know, he often touts his humble Pennsylvania roots from Scranton."
They've moved right.
"Sorry, everybody."
She would not be pinned down.
"Unfortunately, that was under his administration."
"Now, back in 2020, Biden won by just over a point."
I will back anybody up who is doing this.
You wouldn't be OK. No.
And here's the thing.
So that's why he's got my vote.
"These are two absolutely critical battlegrounds here, headed on totally opposite trajectories."
Let P equals 52.
"Yeah, and there's a reason why President Biden is traveling to the state three times in one week."
What's the state of the campaign there based on your reporting as best you can tell?
"And then I guess more importantly, how do we get Democrats over the finish line?"
Because ours is a fight for the future.
"It says Harris courts Polish American votes in Pennsylvania Polish Americans are an important if politically overlooked demographic, but in Pennsylvania many have tended to lean Republican So keep in mind Pennsylvania is a dog fight."
Get comfortable with uncertainty.
"The rally highlighted the political tension as Democrats prepared for their national convention, with Harris as their nominee, hoping to capitalize on her appeal to younger, liberal voters."
"They didn't require new leases, number one."
I did do an interview with some of them.
No clear politics puts her at forty eight point three percent compared to Trump with forty seven point six.
What are we doing?
And Donald Trump is solidly beating Kamala Harris by seven points among independent voters.
And then Donald Trump shortly thereafter calls Pennsylvania a state instead of a commonwealth.
Maybe they accounted for it a bit more.
"He was up 4% on this day, September 19th in 2020, and Hillary Clinton was up 6.6 points in 2016."
Pennsylvania will be the only state that you see Joe Biden campaign in because it's the only swing state where he actually has some deep roots.
"Get rid of the Affordable Care Act, even though 45 million people rely on it."
" key welcome in Congress, Dan Musher from the state of Pennsylvania."
"Ugh, that's not good for them, because they need to win Pennsylvania."

But that's not what it means.
This is not like a normal thing that happens.
But they'll keep lying until we're all gone.
Oh.
Now it's down to seven because of polarization.
The candidates are going to be back here a lot.
And we hear these takes that are just insane.
It's a source of bargaining in the world.
But Donald Trump maintains himself to be in a very solid position.
"But these numbers right now are so bad for her that how could anyone say as of now, Harris is the clear favorite in Pennsylvania?"
Harris offered it to him Tuesday morning as campaign cameras rolled.
Who would determine whether or not a situation was serious enough?

But what's different now like especially looking at the House is that the the makeup of the Republican Conference is far more Trump aligned and Trump comfortable now compared to in 2017 when you have a lot of House Republicans who had been there and even newer House Republicans who are rejecting kind of Trump's economic message.
She got to go through this again.
"Minister, Minister Obama right there, boys."
A 16 point advantage enough so that Pennsylvania went from being likely red to lean red to tilt red to toss up and now lean blue.

Putin has ambitions to restore the former Soviet Union's sphere of influence in Eastern Europe Including Poland so 700,000 Polish Americans in the state and what's interesting enough?"
We most certainly still feel that way.
That's exactly what we're likely to see on display here at the DNC starting Monday.

And so those are issues that advantage either side poll show and they're divided right down the middle.
But it is a tight race.
Like this is President Biden.
"It means now now corporate polls are showing that Donald Trump is back, baby."
"So yesterday, Raphael Warnock, her surrogate on Meet the Press, gets asked about Kamala Harris' mandatory buyback of guns program from 2019."
"And Trump, there's sort of a bit of a positive reassessment of him since he's been president by some folks that might be helping him as well."
We're not doing math here.
They're not going to vote on Election Day.
"The New York Times, it's pretty bad."
"And those are the people are going for heels up, almost as much as black and single black women."
I was great.
"This part of the state is Scranton, Pennsylvania."
Do you think rhetoric is a problem in the country?
"So technically, President Trump could afford to lose Pennsylvania, not that he wants to, obviously, but he could and he could still win the election."
"Okay, that's true."
Robert I know we started off the evening where you said you're not sure who you may support.
What else did you find in your polling?
"Like, I don't even have to go into it."
They were off by six points even in 2016.
Shake hands and just be nice either way.
"So if the woman was like, hey, I'm in a situation and this is the right decision for me."
"I mean, they are looking at numbers that show them in a really, really strong position, a really, really strong position against Donald Trump, in contrast with what we had seen previously."
That's what Kamala Harris will do.
She was making this extremely bold promise that she was going to take the US oil industry possibly criminally prosecute them for their role in climate change.
She has tied.
"And I know he's got a lot of children and we all want a better future for our children, correct?"
"And if she can't recognize there's a problem, how is she going to be trusted to fix the problem?"
"Instead, it became a spectacle of incoherence, with Trump struggling to form complete sentences and obsessing over personal grievances."
Eddie?
"I think I just was like, I want to do something about it."
"And like votes are still coming in, but Nikki Haley received over 100,000 votes."
"But of course, the popular vote doesn't mean everything."
"And because, you know, there's reports that he may do a little pit stop here."
And you don't figure that out right away.
"Your boss says, so did you finish that project I asked for?"
"So so if he's up by two to three points in Pennsylvania, he is easily winning."
"They were founded on political activism, she said."
"Shifting our focus to Arizona, another pivotal state, we observe similar competitive dynamics."
They go around to Trump rallies to interview the people there.
"Philadelphia, the state's largest city, is a democratic stronghold, with African-American voters making up a large portion of the electorate."
And just then you were here the last time around?
The Democrat has also a slight lead in four of the seven swing states.
Vance was here.
And that puts him up four points.
"And on these issues, Donald Trump and Republicans for large clearly have the advantage."
Michelle has a unique appeal of being a popular surrogate.
"The only person I know to ask her hard questions was this guy says, was the brother on 60 Minutes."
And when he gets the job done it was always for the betterment of the country.
I'll never forget there and keep that hundred dollar bill framed up there.
Trump didn't even endorse this guy either.
Fellow GOP Senate candidate J.D.
"I could certainly see Harris, if she wins the state, getting 50 to 51 percent of the vote though."
And that in many ways looks like her challenge and her task in the remaining weeks of the campaign.
So the race has changed now.
You look weird doing that.
So let's keep going now.
"But I think the other thing that people often should remember, you know, they're different people."
"I'm hearing reports about Trump signs scattered all across Philly, especially South Philly."
That's just the way the polling is.
"Baby, I've been here before."
You've campaigned across Pennsylvania and you've gone to places like Somerset County where Donald Trump won by 56 points four years ago.
"If you look at the product of the work of Democrats in recent years, they're speaking to those folks in a way that I think, you know, frankly, we maybe weren't doing a few years ago, but we are doing now."
It's kind of a thing.
"You go to California, it's going to be a lot different than in Florida."
"Stay home, bum."
Look at that Trump.
"Notably, Harris leads Trump in Arizona and North Carolina, while the two are nearly tied in Nevada."
"Let's get this money together, and let's get the economy back to what it was."
"Picking a guy who, look, served this country as a football coach, as a teacher, really has been delivering in Minnesota for his people there."
"Doesn't mean that their track record is awful and Trump is basically outside the margin of error for victory in the state, which is a very good sign, 49% in any poll that is a very good position to be in."
"I mean, he is speaking to a scary far-right fringe right now and bringing those issues to the debate stage instead of issues that people actually care about."
"Pennsylvania is the center of the universe, said Cliff Maloney, who leads efforts to get Republican voters to vote by mail in the state."
But so that's all on the line in this race.
They couldn't kill me.
Because we shouldn't ban fracking.
"And Kamala Harris decided to put somebody who may claim to be from the Rust Belt, even though Minnesota is not really the Rust Belt, but has a track record of a nut job."
"This in the, in the post and it'll look really cool."
"Despite their contributions to the community, Trump painted them as a threat, encouraging his supporters to push for their removal."
"What do you wish, based on what you've heard tonight, that Carson and Faith understood about you, your side?"
"I have tried all my can to get you to go to Las Vegas because Nevada really is in play, but let's be serious for a second."
I'm kidding.
"So my guess is, and it's an educated guess, this will be the one place you will see him on the ground for Kamala Harris."
I'll tell you what.
"Well, that's exactly right."
I love the American flag.
But this isn't the only thing that she's flipped on that you found and you found a lot of other inconsistencies.
"I think Harris is probably up in Pennsylvania, like one to two percentage points."
"John Fetterman, if you remember at that time, barely even put a code in his sentence."
Jeeves!
"And this, by the way, is terrible news for Kamala Harris."
"I think what's important, I earn more votes than anybody in the history of running for governor in Pennsylvania."
"I will tell you how he protected you, quote-unquote."
They're trying hard.
And she is bringing some stars to the world.
I want to switch it up.
"Democrats have gone down, down, down, down while Republicans have gone up and up and up."
"It's really, really, it's a really, really tight election."
"And because Donald Trump feels like making stuff up, you've got hard work and public servants who cannot do their jobs."
 Total running time for each presidential candidate after tonight's heated Harris Trump debate wrapped up a little while ago from President Trump Speaking just under 43 minutes Vice President Harris speaking just over 37 and a half minutes Plus we just got the first results from our incident poll a debate watchers stand by for that.
What stood out to you?
"He now people don't believe that, obviously."
She's still in a dead heat with Donald Trump.
"And Pennsylvania alongside many other battleground states has seen quite significant shifts in favor of the Democratic contender now, Kamala Harris."
Pennsylvania Trump in Harris 49%.
"Oh, I think the prosecution lets this hang out in the air for as long as they can."
It was literally a last minute thing.
16 electoral votes are up for grabs in North Carolina and Georgia each.
We're talking.
So he's asking a direct question.
That was one of the polls that had John Federman defeating Dr. Oz by four percentage points in the final poll.
Prescriptions require an online consultation with the health care provider who will determine if appropriate restrictions apply.
He's in a steel town.
And now they're trying to figure out how do I apply for help.
All the conspiracy theorists already think that the government is made up of lizards in human suits.
My opinion is that the justice system is being weaponized against certain individuals.
There is consistency in where Kamala Harris performs.
"You know, I stand up here for two hours and I speak without a mistake."
I understand that.
"In today's final poll, also conducted by Signal on the same dates with different 800 likely voters, Harris received 43% of the vote, while Trump received 44%."
They keep calling people a tinks and lying about reparations and then trying to argue why it's appropriate to mutilate your children.
It's not like Biden's super popular.
"Obviously, Trump did better than, you know, Mitt Romney significantly in those areas."
"I think when you start having Republicans come out for you, and we're not talking about rhinos."
"And I believe that she could very well lose the state by two to three points when it's all said and done, depending on how things go over the next 35 days."
"And I don't know if everyone else, everybody else who's going to the polls has that mentality."
They were only off by 100%.
Harris has also been preparing by holding mock debates.
Hell's Angels and the Amish riding up together to meet their communist foe and defeat them.
"The polls are obviously moving in Democrats' favor, but we're also seeing it with volunteer signups in places like western Pennsylvania, my congressional district."
Kamala Harris received 46% of the vote and Donald Trump 45%.
"You know, what I would say is when I ran for mayor, you know, I ran on the idea that I was going to ensure that residents' garbage was picked up on time."
Kamala's operation is being poorly run in the nation's biggest battleground.
"You didn't think that him auditing the employment history of each, each one of the employees was the right move."
Why do I share that with you?
That's why We are supporting him.
"This was a plot to make sure that America never becomes first again, because his supporters already think he's the second coming of Jesus."
"I think that you should do a skateboard collab with RFK, a Maha skateboard."
And that's what I love about my community.
What are you going to do if you're president?
"Now, this was in the middle of a pandemic."
"It's a little bit strange to even wrap our heads around, Kate."
"He criticized Harris's approval of the Nord Stream pipeline, questioning her decision-making and intelligence, which raises concerns about her leadership capabilities."
I'd love to know your take on them.
She's in office.
He is unwilling to meet for a second debate.
"So what are they gonna, you know, it's like, what are you gonna do now?"
"I don't want to say two evils But it's kind of when you have these two selections I think that obviously he has a clear choice of picking trump and he changed his mindset on that originally my family and I we were ben karson fans and uh That kind of when trump got the ticket then that's who our guy was we weren't for biden or Kamala harris, absolutely, sir."
"He re-ups some polls that have been done in battleground states, not necessarily Pennsylvania, but other states."
And I could see myself voting for her.
What is the rarest 23?
"At least according to one survey, the vice president has managed to galvanize a critical vote bank in her favor."
Her focus on climate change stands in stark contrast to Trump's dismissal of the issue.
"Back in 2020, he could go to Quinnipiac's polls out of Pennsylvania."
Because I don't want to see Trump elected after the chaos of the prior four years.
"However, Harris and the Democrats cannot afford to ignore the state, as a strong showing in Ohio could help bolster their chances in other key battlegrounds across the Midwest."
"That saying about professional soldiers, it doesn't mean that the amateur is going to do something unpredictable and suffer a bad end."
"Probably the rule of law, like Dan said, someone who's going to follow our constitutional process, someone who's going to honor that."
She is still leading in the national averages.
See a democratic shift there.
"And yes, that's true, you have to give people something to vote for."
"And they know that former President Trump has done well here in 2016 and 2020, especially in the Pittsburgh area in the ex urban in rural counties around Pittsburgh."
I've done multiple streams going over that poll.
"You know, I've been proud to be endorsed by firefighter unions in my campaigns."
"You will be, I'll tell you if everything works out, if everybody gets out and votes on January 5th or before."
I know you're a fan of that a proponent of it Next time you come on we'll get into that a little bit more.
This is not good for Harris at all because if Republicans are now picking up steam and early voting and now this drops.
"And I think we've got to help her make the case for what she's going to do in this next term and also remind people what Donald Trump did when he was in office, which was to do tax cuts for billionaires and huge corporations, that same trickle-down economic fairy tale that has never worked, that plotted to strip places like my region, western Pennsylvania, for parts."
You're saying she should have to not wear her earrings?
So I do not have a lot of credentials to interpret this from that perspective.
"You know, we saw the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week."
"I can't forget about them, my friend."
Just you family?
"Absolutely massive, right?"
We reached out to both campaigns and they both gave us different statements about their approach to the Latino vote.
"Let me just give you the bottom line, though."
Let me start by saying this.
He warns that Israel will no longer exist if Vice President Kamala Harris becomes president.
"Well, you know, look at in a world where anything can happen in US politics, anything has already happened several times."
"And then kind of like in the middle of his speech, Kristi Noem's like, all right, so here are the songs that you wanted us to play."
Probably two or is that everybody?
I know I don't think it was since 2016 that Republicans haven't won here in Pennsylvania a key swing state What do they have to do differently this time around to win?
He was super friendly and I had zero expectation.
"The eighth poll was conducted between October 2 and 10 by American Pulse Research and Polling among 1,193 likely voters."
"And if you're pro-FBA, and if you're not pro-majority in this country, you're not going to go far in the Democratic party at all."
And went on to play 40 minutes of songs.
So we have a real problem to solve.
"But like this guy on the internet who is a professional poster spends like his whole day, right?"
"Well, in our estimates, Harris is getting the same percent of support among black voters that Joe Biden got in 2020."
It wasn't really a surprise.
Is that good enough?
And I think that was a decision that showed good judgment.
I don't believe it.
That could be the real kickoff.
"There are a lot of reasons to believe that Bob Casey is in a position where he could help Kamala Harris, that Tammy Baldwin is in a position where she could help Kamala Harris."
"But it is a good indicator, especially if it's like every single update, it's more and more Republican."
So Trump said on social media that he was shot and was hit by a bullet in the upper part of his right ear.
She'll vote Harris in November.
What the hell do you need to be working for go home?
You know that.
"Her multiple trips to Pennsylvania, particularly to Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, are designed to keep Democratic voters energized."
"But voting for that man and having him elected back into office is the step that we need to take to fix, to make this country great."
Don't step on the horse.
"Well, I felt that way at the time."
"I had a lot of disagreements with Senator Obama, but I served with him."
"And of course, I mean, it's like you ask Kamala Harris, well, we're on the brink of World War Three."
"And last week, the movement announced it won't endorse Kamala Harris, but they did urge supporters to vote against Trump and avoid third party candidates."
"And if rounding up and deporting millions of desperate people, many of them women and children, is the answer to everything."
That's big and that momentum.
The eleventh poll was conducted between September 12th and 18 by Massing Polling Group among 800 likely voters.
"However, what's really important also to notice here, the margin here is large, but they're definitely underestimating Donald Trump in this state."
"Yeah, look, I think Governor Walz just has to talk about the work that he's been doing up into this point."
So they're coming in.
He likes to talk about Kamala being vice president for years.
Now starts the surge.
"And look, I mean, the guy he's running against, like just he's just like not from here."
"We saw that former President Trump was there just a couple weeks ago, August 17th, in Wilkes-Barre."
"And just for the sake of argument, the middle of October poll of Quinnipiac had Biden plus eight."
"Hey man, did you see this?"
"Well, why would voters care about that?"
"How'd that work out for you, Senator?"
The polls are already out of Biden's favor.
It's got to be so scary.
"You've got those longstanding party loyalties, then those evolving demographics and then those immediate economic worries all mixed together."
"We're a divided country, but the vice president's focused on trying to grow her coalition."
It's now very likely to vote Republican for a third straight cycle.
Alright.
My name is Anthony Bryan Logan.
"You could argue that maybe the Philly suburbs could get bluer, but still there's a demographic floor for Donald Trump because even in those counties, there's a sizable portion of the population that is white working class."
"Moving forward to the seventh poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University from August 8 to 12, with 1,738 likely voters, Harris received 48% of the vote, while Trump received 45%."
He's up by two and that's very telling because that poll was actually accurate in the midterms.
"They start 65, $70,000 a year plus overtime."
It's not right.
What's the... What's the... What's the...
"Yeah, well, listen, a part of it is having a conversation."
"I think it's a great question, and that concern is definitely out there."
I don't care anything about just feelings.
But I can't change that because they believe it because they've heard it so many times.
Like is this going to be like a pie chart?
Talk about his strategy to win.
But Walls ended up getting picked.
"So now they're looking more at Bob Casey thinking, okay, maybe this is a guy who can pick, we can pick off."
I've seen the video.
"Let's say your boss gives you an assignment, says she needs it by Friday."
"I'm not sure about the, I think that comes from what we need, the idea that half haven't been contacted."
She's ready.
I go to Erie all the time.
"So let me ask you a hard him talk about, you know very direct and forward a you because a lot of peop side of the spectrum, the they say that it bothers you?"
"If a trucking company is going to lose money, they're not going to make the deliveries."
"I did and listen, I love what I do and I always want to have purpose in public service."
"They have much, they vote much later and closer to the election day."
We have been covering this around the clock and we are getting new details here.
You get some Texas burgers.
I believe Arizona might be the only state that's outside of margin of error.
He had just had that stroke.
"Like, what are you talking about?"
We saw Elizabeth Warren confront it very head on and really challenge men to take a look at her policies and vote for her.
These guys aren't even looking.
"The tenth poll was conducted by Morning Consult between September 9th and 18 with 1,256 likely voters."
"Because I've actually seen you online get criticized, get ridiculed."
"And then from 2020, Democrats are down significantly."
"So while you hear what these job gains and the Biden administration and they are very much real, they don't hit every single county in this country equally."
"Oh you see the message that she's for the people, which is the middle class, which I am middle class and the laws about women's rights."
Our election is about understanding the importance of this beautiful country of ours in terms of what we stand for around the globe as a democracy.
One last question.
But now it's 28% Republican and not even 60% Democrat.
They're going to go.
We see somebody up on the roof.
Stay tuned to Katie K. A.
And so she needs to try to get those January 6th wary Republicans to come along.
I'm thinking for myself and for my country.
"Cumberland, Donald Trump won that by 18 and 10."
This is huge.
And she's kind of rewriting history in terms of her position on the border.
I think Kamala Harris and her VP pick are much more hopeful and positive for everybody.
The eleventh poll was conducted between October 7 and 10 by the New York Times Siena College among 857 registered voters.
"That's enough for Ohio to be placed as a safe Republican state, and given that these two are almost certain to vote within just about a point or two of one another, I'm going to add Iowa to that category as well."
And that's Mr. Trump himself.
Bill Clinton has been out there saying you know if we vetted people maybe they wouldn't be murdered by illegal aliens.
"So I think you guys for watching this video, please subscribe, share this video with your friends comment down below on what other videos you'd like to see next."
"And then to put your fucking head down and lecture black men about how we need to vote for her just because she's black, which is identity politics to the fullest."
Were you happy to see the swap?
That's all that matters for real.
"Harris, in her bid to win over white voters, has worked tirelessly to reshape her image and bridge the gap on key issues, particularly fracking."
"Kind of in the middle of the state, more or less."
"The sharp contrast are not coming in through as clearly from the Harris campaign and voters who are still on the fence like that sharper clearer explanation, at least so far from the Trump campaign gravitating just a tad in that direction over Harris."
He noted the abandonment of American citizens and valuable equipment left behind.
Sounds fantastic.
And the media just picked it up.
But it's not just Kamala Harris that's getting smashed by media.
Those those pollsters suck.
The ruling in Pennsylvania requires mail-in ballots to be signed and dated and to be returned by a specific deadline.
The data speaks for itself.
"In recent elections, turnout in Philadelphia and its suburbs has been crucial to democratic success."
"After their contentious debate, the pair putting differences aside to come together at the memorial marking the 23rd anniversary of September 11th."
"For example, a truck delivering groceries, fresh produce, say, if they don't factor in the cost of fuel to make the deliveries, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' high gas prices would make it so that the trucking company loses money."
And he was laying down on a roof that wasn't even that far from the venue.
And that's what we heard.
There is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody but himself.
"So what you put in your grocery cart, who you vote for in an election, free will is over."
How is the Harris campaign kind of working to close the gap on some of these key issues?
"It was mostly Trump, just huge leads for Joe."
It is enough to say that Kamala Harris is yet to announce her economic plan.
Harris is riding a big wave of momentum to the Democratic DNC there.
"There's Tim Walz, her running mate on stage, to a packed house."
Who submitted that to him?
"And on top of that, it's a very swingy bellwether demographic."
"And he doesn't believe you should abort the baby in the first second or third trimester and as it's vapor and zest, which I agree with."
Whatever that means.
"Anne Marie, it's funny that you say you confuse the pronunciations."
"Biden received 28 percent support among self-identified independents, a figure that rose to 30 percent for Harris."
Now Donald Trump stands at the lowest point he has been in this entire past three months.
Has any of that changed?
"So I guess my question is, how much weight should we really give these early polls?"
Look at what happened to FEMA.
We know all of these trends.
"That kind of blunder happening in this day and age by the highly skilled, highly capable U.S. security agency that's supposed to be protecting leaders of the free world is almost unbelievable."
"And if he doesn't win, we all know what happened."
And we passed the strongest bill in the nation to make sure that only women could play in women's sports.
"Well, if he is winning Pennsylvania by two to three points, he's winning Wisconsin and Michigan."
I just like to eat.
"Use the built-in stand to display him proudly on your desk, or just keep him under your bed."
That three percent.
"But the argument that was made by the GOP was that, sure, Kamala Harris could re-inspire the Democratic base, but Trump would re-inspire the Republican base even more against Harris than Trump."
That's the avalanche begins.
"The debate last night, and Kamala really trashed Trump good."
The New York Times poll also has not been included on this average here.
" Senator Bob Casey, welcome to the show."
" Hello, Tucson!"
It's gone.
"However, is that a bad thing?"
"So it's hard to attribute to one factor and other specific stop, but certainly that's why those campaigns are going there so much, it's going to be a key state."
I'm TJ Monotok.
"Joining us are Daniel Scarpinato, Republican strategist, former Chief of Staff for Governor Doug Ducey, and Reginald Boulding, former Democratic leader in the State House of Representatives."
And what we can glean from that agreement is that she offered them information that's valuable to them.
Those leads are largely within the margin of error.
"Ironically enough, there were some Biden, most tree, Hano State House District."
"Some even say it's the enemy of the people, which is why I recommend Ground News."
"Like in Easton, where Jackie Kroll today is watching her grandson."
You see Black men for Harris.
I think that goes to the core of our democracy.
And then you've also got this going on at the same time on the same day.
But it's true for the voters in Belfon.
I wasn't sure how to go about this.
Harris matched him among voters 65 and older and saw support from white voters without a college degree rise to 41 percent from April.
Thank you Catherine.
He mocks the person who's having an emergency in the crowd.
And then you have Bucks County where the registration date is moving right off a cliff.
Don't get me wrong.
"When he was up against Biden, the first real thing that we saw was that in the most, in the time where the Democratic Party needed to unify the most, they were not unified because many members of Congress, senators, governors had concerns about President Biden's viability."
"I mean, she was able to do it in the debate to talk about her own proposals and what her own priorities would be as president."
I love you.
And you're already seeing Donald Trump obviously talk about this as a campaign issue.
She's got the lowest ever polling for things like that.
The Secret Service was able to grab him and cover him.
"I know there's 5,600 of you in the room."
"And if Benjamin Netanyahu would just visit Gaza and meet the people there, he'd stop what he's doing right away."
"For one, it reaffirms the Republican argument that strict election regulations are necessary to prevent potential voter fraud."
"So in the in the in the truest sense of the term, these are indeed swing states, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania."
Anybody who's not white Christian nationalist has to go.
It explains how America chooses its president.
Harris finished six points ahead of Trump in this poll.
How do you pronounce F-A-N-I Fani?
"It's actually not in my best interest to lie to you because then I would look terrible, right?"
He already enjoys the support of white male voters by an overwhelming number.
But but clearly having the Trump endorsement was a was a was great for momentum for Dr. Oz.
That's bull crap.
"That's not good for her because if Quinnipiac has even half the error they had back in 2020, that means Trump's winning by a point."
What results?
So the 46 to 43 lead here is also very much in line with what we see on Quinnipiac of a 48 versus 45 point lead and then a 50 to 46 lead for Kamala Harris in the New York Times poll.
I don't think anybody should get freaked out by the fact that the polls are close.
You could get people out to vote that would probably not vote otherwise while Democrats they may be more reliant on election day.
And it worked.
One of my favorite places in the country.
"My husband is, Doug, you are doing so much and you've been traveling all over our country and I want to thank you."
Trump is a joke.
He has written on X.
Never.
And you can see which stories and key topics that interest you that the liberal media is hiding.
"And, in fact, I believe if you look at the internals, it's actually a Trump lead."
Reuben is the kind of person we need in Washington.
It can be misleading because you do got a lot of ancestral Democrats and I agree with that.
"If he's winning there, well, he just needs Georgia and he got 270."
"Well, you know, look a couple things."
So I thank you all so very much for what you are doing.
It's got what?
"When push comes to shove, when it's election day, it really is going to come down to individual state considerations, you know, whether whether they think their vote will count."
Is she Elizabeth Taylor?
And so this is really interesting here And so what we can see in this state also in the state of Pennsylvania was going to come really close is so there's this article It talks about how Pennsylvania slipping from Donald Trump's grasp and it says Kamala Harris gains ground with crucial Hispanic voters in swing state That could decide 2024 election.
"And not just that, it hasn't gone blue since Obama in 2008."
"Harris, however, has since walked back her earlier stance, clarifying that she now supports the continued use of natural gas, particularly in light of the Inflation Reduction Act, which opens new gas leases."
I ain't gonna lie because you do shit.
And I will let you know exactly why the reason is that Kamala Harris is going to ultimately win the state of Pennsylvania.
And it's sad to see the state of a lot of those places.
"Speaking of Trump, I read that he's holding a big fundraiser in Palm Beach that I expected to raise $43 million for his campaign."
"But fine, voter registration, it's not everything."
"She was one of the, I think she's like the most unlike VP and history in terms of approval writing."
"Pretty much everyone we talked to, red, blue, undecided, felt the same way."
"And they're going to claim, well, actually the VP selection doesn't change that much."
 Are Democrats right to be nervous about Pennsylvania?
What a pile of crap.
Pennsylvania or Philadelphia itself has got its own like constituencies.
Republican Speaker Mike Johnson says the House will conduct a full investigation into this tragedy and the how in the committee chairman of the House Oversight Committee says he's calling on the Secret Service director to speak at a hearing on July 22nd.

"And so the president wouldn't do anything, I think, to to to gin up anger or angst among the opposition because it would make me could hurt his his candidates."

What they have done is put in place rules that they would like to follow.
"So, you know, so we were all right there."
But what has not been widely reported because there's just so much of it out there and you almost have to to catalog all the the anecdotal data.
" This could be a great sign when it comes to Donald Trump possibly winning the state of Pennsylvania, the most important state of the 2024 election."
They're the only pollsters right now that have Harris winning Pennsylvania.
And then the trend line continued.

I can't underscore Lana how critical that July 13th day has been for the former president and his base of support having covered lots of rallies before and since then his supporters see this as a seminal moment in the campaign and in their view Trump returning here as a sign of perseverance but also a kind of recognition of continuing on and we talked to his supporters and they believe that many of them believe that he was protected that day for a reason.

Mic drop moment right there.
"It is, you, you, you're not really going to be too much in the center."

It makes a lot of sense.
And I tried to learn from them.

" Well, the polls are going back and forth like the final seconds of a close NBA game."
I get I know everything Everything I know every time I'm different.
Don't tell me something that I cannot believe at all.
And the article kind of hints at some deeper issues within the campaign.
" Now we've got the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro."

"You do this interview with Charlotte May the God and you go out there and you talk about how, you know, when it comes to reparations, well, you know, I'm open to it or something that effect or, you know, we're willing to look into that."
So this has been an honor tonight.
"Second, polls show the two candidates are evenly matched in the state for several months."

It's a fake issue because Donald Trump is not taking our democracy.
"Yes, and I've again worked on that My values have not changed."
"And if Harris wins Pennsylvania, well, at that point, Trump needs to win a state like Arizona than Wisconsin, just a barely cracked 270."

I mean these are staunch Trump supporters and basically we're seeing people young and old many of the people that were at the July 13th rally came today they said nothing was going to keep them away.

I'm proud to co-chair black voters for Kamala Harris here in Pennsylvania.
"Oh, for sure."

Looking at.
 So we're just three weeks away from election day.
Let's make fishing great again.

"And he's doing all he can to avoid a hostage deal, to bring all the hostages and prisoners home and to allow unfettered access to humanitarian aid."

"You vote for a leader who sees you, who has a plan to serve you, and is willing to acknowledge that there are weaknesses in our existing policies."

"But in today's video, we are going to talk about that."
"Like, yeah, it sucks, but it's not as important regionally and demographically as Pennsylvania."

"Sex, drugs, and rock and roll, right?"
"But at the same time, you don't want to just write someone off because they're older, there's a fine line there."

What is the Biden campaign doing to try to appeal to them?

"In Pennsylvania, Biden received 46 percent support from older voters and 33 percent from white voters without a college degree."

"Welcome back, everyone."
"Anyway, here's my challenge to all the Republicans â€” in Charleroi, in Washington County, Pennsylvania, in Springfield, Ohio, and everywhere else that has been threatened by the stochastic terrorism perpetrated by Donald Trump and J.D."

"Both Harris and Trump are putting Pennsylvania in the spotlight, knowing that the state's voters could very well decide the outcome of the election."
"Hell, it's actually the opposite."
"In 1980, when Reagan was running, he won the nomination."
"Well, it's an issue that divides voters."
And I've done that.
They came here to support him because they know what will happen if Trump does not become president.
"But this is the first time in a while, actually, since the debate that he's actually been here in the Philadelphia, Philadelphia area."

"But the other one is turnout, because there is an issue in which right now black voters are saying at an 83 percent rate that they're going to turn out, that they're definitely going to turn out or that they already have some cast balance by mail."
"So you could argue, well, maybe just maybe a chunk of this registration surge is because of ancestral Democrats, and it probably is."
So it's kind of pushed those folks over to Harris.
This equals very small profit margins and therefore we have been purchasing a fraction of the feeder cattle that we have the capacity to feed.
It kind of did make me sway a little bit toward Kamala Harris with the same exact fact that she'd made as well.

That's the whole DeSantis versus Newsome thing.
Yeah the interesting part about Metro Pittsburgh western Pennsylvania Metro Pittsburgh had voted lockstep Democratic going from the 1988 presidential election where the caucus wanted in a suite.
It's from Russia because they want Trump to win.

So of course and I agree with him.
"So when they get a ring up from a pollster, they answer and say, I'm all in for Trump."
Thompson is particularly interested in Harris' plans to promote economic equity and create opportunities for all Americans.
Let's go win.
"I mean, if you take a look at what's going on in Springfield, Ohio, a town of 50,000 people, they've just added 32,000 people, illegal immigrants."
Trump is not winning Pennsylvania.

We just said a side Kamala Harris point five said victory.
So speaking of black males we're asking where's the rest of the Democratic Party in particular Michelle Obama who's now being asked where you've been.

"And to some involved in the efforts, it's happening at the encouragement of former President Donald Trump."
"It's not like it's, you know, Nevada that's worth only six electoral votes where, yeah, Trump could win it, but even then it would not be enough to win the presidency."

And this is what it comes down to.
Now he can't afford to lose.
Thank you so much for listening.
There's these marginal voters who may or may not show up.
They're going to vote on their gut and their heart.
"And it's interesting, Akayla, in our NBC News poll, voters were asked, what is the one issue you feel so strongly about that you will vote for or against a candidate solely on that issue?"
"Ms. Harris is an active member of AKA, the oldest Greek letter organization established by African-American college-educated women, and has said the organization changed her life."
The registered voters have traditionally led Democratic.
"So I was with my son and I put out a video and in that video, all right, we are in Reading, Pennsylvania, just about five minutes from where I live."
"I also know in the context of history, nobody got 40 acres and a mule."
"We got, we need him."
"Next, in a twist that sounds straight out of a sci-fi movie, Russia's Ramzan Kadyrov has equipped a Tesla Cybertruck with a machine gun for the Russian-Ukraine war."
"Like you could tell that when he says he's sorry, it's from his heart."
"Donald Trump was doing an event that was meant to be him speaking, a town hall, answering questions and talking about what he would be doing as president."
"It could be used to suggest that he is far, far, far, far right and views Trump as a sellout."
That's consistent with another poll that was in the field from AARP and basically the average of polls in Pennsylvania.
"Well, we're just going to write it out."

"The Democrat, Democratic Party are the ones who are aggressive and violent."
"But the language thing, that I understand."
"It's popular both with Republicans and Democrats, but for different reasons."
I wish there were more diverse candidates.
But it's just so that way.
"In recent elections, the state has been decided by razor-thin margins, highlighting the importance of every single vote."
The child star.
"But even then when you compare the final numbers in 2020 and 2016 to their numbers right now, you could argue this is bad for Harris because it's only Harris plus three."
We have seven point miss in Pennsylvania.
Kamala Harris has to carry all of those if she wants to win the election.

Do we believe in the promise of America?
The campaign has really spent a lot of time focusing on the central and western part of the state.
Just hopeful thinking I guess.
You'll be just fine.
"At the very minimum, you must come out and you must cast your ballot because standing on the sideline is not sufficient and it's not going to get us anywhere."
"And all I could think of Senator Vance, are you going to tell Ann colder or Condoleezza Rice or Elizabeth Dolt, they're miserable cat ladies."

I'm curious because I don't see how it's a high-quality poll far from it.
They have those industrial steel towns.
"He is a political commentator and the host of Joe Watkins, state of independence on Lighthouse TV."
"If somebody knows that you have a gun in your house, they say, let's go after somebody else."
I that's silly pronouns don't exist.
But then there's these other counties that have been kind of trending to the red.
"Trump revisited the town where he survived his first assassination attempt, which was on the 13th of July."
It's not going to work.
"And Democrats, if he were anybody who wasn't a centrist, there's a clip about Tim Wals outreach."
And you can see a lot of these comments are just rough.
We encourage our audience to engage with the electoral process actively.
That was back when Biden was still the presumptive nominee for the Democratic Party.
"All right, Robert Costa with a great segue because we have more to talk about with the economy in Pittsburgh force."
I just think that it brought people together in 2020.
"And so what actually ended up happening like in the state of Arizona, Arizona for example, we read about right, or maybe it was Georgia, I think it was Arizona though, but he had these electors who were signed up to vote for him."

"And, you know, analysts believe former President Trump's endorsement clinched J.D."
"I just don't like his politics and do not like his what he would like to see, which is the United States to become a dictatorship."
He's ranting and rambling until people get bored and leave his rallies.
"That they're just badly coordinated and they can't figure out what's going on like Kamala people getting bounced from meetings, Kamala's people not really, I mean they can't make direct contact, they're not picking up the phone and stuff like that."
But I knew that delay does not mean denial.
And I think it's the price of weak leadership in our White House.
"Saying thank you and for, you know, I understand American is the last bastion of freedom, man."
Donald Trump is still in the lead in all those swing states.
"I appreciate you bringing up Latinos because there are 600,000 Latino voters in Pennsylvania, about half of them, according to some of the research we've seen, have not been contacted."
That's not what Harris needed.
"Yeah, Twitter back and forth."
"Now when Joe Biden comes in, they're the supposed hometown boy from Scranton, Pennsylvania, he gets about 17, 17.5% of the votes in 2020."
You cannot tell me that.
So he's not talking about the people at all.
God bless all of you.
So it is top of mind for me.
"According to a poll conducted between October 3 and 7, 2024, by Marist College, which surveyed 1,327 likely voters, Trump holds a commanding lead over Harris, with 52 percent of the vote compared to Harris's 46 percent, giving Trump a six-point advantage."
A free spirit.
"And if you challenge that somehow, you're you know, you're you're you're anti anti anti company, anti corporate."
But guess what?
So getting anything done related to election reform has certainly been a challenge.
"I mean, and some would say, I mean, Republicans would say that Senator Casey never really had a race like this."
You can see the difference.
Hundreds of people killed and President Biden and Vice President Harris were down there meeting with local officials and comforting families asking how they could help and Donald Trump at a rally just started making up stories about the Biden administration withholding aid from Republican areas and siphoning off aid to give to undocumented immigrants.
Better than I have in a while.
"T on the outer banks were h the costs down there are roof, there's not enough so much that needs to hap get our gas prices down."
She lost it.
"If given a choice between two candidates, one of whom favor granting amnesty to all legal aliens and one of whom all legal aliens and one of whom favor deporting all illegal aliens, MSNBC viewers, 68 percent would support a candidate who gives amnesty to every one of the 20 to 25 million illegal aliens in this country."
I think about this a lot because it's so different from what we see right now out of the Republican nominee.
"Tonight, 22 days until the election and vice president Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump are both in the must win state of Pennsylvania."
"If you get Arizona, if you get Pennsylvania, wait, actually, I think you might need, you might need another state after that."
So here we have Trump at plus three in Arizona.
We need you out there.
"If you overload people and say, he's just crazy or heâ€”I mean, I think unhinged is the right word, but then you have to bring it back to their lived experience and their reality."
"I'm like, I can't even do this."
"He ended up at one point saying, no one wants to hear questions anyway."
"And if that's not the case, then a liberal needs to explain to me why do they make it extremely hard and try and find all these loopholes to where we just want to secure election."
That'd be so dope.
Could you imagine after 40 hours you get time and a half and no tax on that time and a half money?
"But if he's up by two to three points as of now, which by the way, this should be Harris's best polling right now, especially in August."
Pardon me as I look away but I see another ambulance behind one of the rafters near where former President Trump was speaking.
It's gotta be somebody in there.
Yeah I mean I think I think that's spot on.
"Because let's face it, I'm a little out of practice."
So what does that mean?
"OK, so on the one hand, you certainly have had the experience, I think, of having to ask people to support you, even if they don't agree with you about everything."
"There's a combination, John, because some of them do beat up on Trump."
"I don't know who's out there trying to get in, but there."
"Take eggs, for example."
"Oh, there's some some copyrighted music."
And so he brings George H.W.
"But Ruben and I were talking to a remarkable group of men right before we came out, and we were talking about this, and somebody said, I'm just so tired of everybody being divided and mean and nasty."
Grandpa?
We knew it was going to be her.
"The current polling data, showing Trump with a slight two-point lead over Harris, underscores how competitive Pennsylvania will be in 2024."
And that was amazing to be a part of.
It's really crazy over here.
"I'm still trying to work out where to go, Amika, to be honest."
They just worship their God who is Trump.
"Look, everybody's entitled to their opinion, Street told reporters Wednesday during a news conference."
"I think that the current outgoing Republican, he went to be the president of a university and it opened up the seat."
And the people that are making these decisions are not a lot of women.
They've moved back behind us and some of them in the direction of their cars or towards all the the walking areas that got them.
John Verone-Lopez has this report.
"Major, this will be Harris' eighth visit in western Pennsylvania."
She beat Donald Trump in the debate and she's had some good polling numbers off that.
But it seems that that post-debate bump that a lot of analysts expected that she would have is pretty much gone now.
"And she said, the polling is so bad in Pennsylvania, that not even Josh Shapiro could deliver the state."
"Politics, essentially."
That's what they're claiming.
"If Kamala Harris wins the 2024 election, will you trust the results?"
"Nyle, good to see you, my friend."
"Well, you know, the book on Kamala Harris was that she was a do-nothing vice president, that the White House itself didn't trust her, and that she was harsh."
And I think that is exactly what the president is trying to do today.
"They did all kinds of things, rated Mar-a-Lago, sitting in a trial, being indicted, being convicted."
"Then in 92, some people wanted Bill Clinton to pick Jesse Jackson."
I think about this a lot because it's so different from what we see right now out of the Republican nominee and increasingly the entire party has just decided it's okay.
Should we play your songs now?
"He died yesterday, he died from a bullet wound and allegedly three other people were also injured at that rally so that makes four victims either dead or injured."
And I think it's because people see that she's offering a positive vision for the country and rejecting the chaos and division of Donald Trump.
"Hi Gabriel, how are you?"
We have brand new sound from the Vice President in an interview that she did earlier today with Stephanie Rule at MSNBC.
I believe that the Kamala Harris camp is getting nervous.
"Donald Trump wins in the electoral college, 287 electoral votes to Kamala Harris's 251 electoral votes."
That's what I got to tell you about that.
"The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania could be how pivotal, how pivotal."
It's 17.
The U.N. estimates place that it would take over a decade just to eliminate the rubble and it would take multiple decades to rebuild.
Now the worst of the worst kind of human beings have already come out and expressed themselves on social media yay they're cheering on or oh my god I can't believe you missed number one somebody lost their life today and another person is fighting for their life.
That's massive.
If this is what it's trying to say.
Turn that music up.
"So on issue after issue after issue on all of the metrics, Democrats are actually showing that they're there to work for working class Americans while Republicans just do this shtick once every four years to get into office."
"Well, ask Mitt Romney how picking Paul Ryan to win the state of Wisconsin worked."
"And what they're not factoring in is that the people who held him back, the circuit breaker people, aren't going to be in this administration."
"She's got momentum now, but this race still has a long way to go."
I do not believe this shooting was political at all.
"The vice president just laughed, but in fact, in September, Harris visited Pennsylvania once every three days, a remarkable frequency for a battleground state."
What about now?
"I want each other's names because you shared a commitment to democracy, a commitment to personal freedom, a commitment to public education, a commitment to infrastructure."
I feel it right now.
I don't know.
"Just overall, because I don't like who's running against him."
And Harris's ability to appeal to them could prove decisive.
And we'll see those continue as Nathan Wade is answering questions at the house today.
