 So this election season 12 News is talking to groups of voters who could make a big difference in what's expected to be a very close race.
"12 News journalist Bram Resnick started our conversation with Gen Z voters, four of whom are casting a presidential ballot for the first time this upcoming November."
"I sat down last week with four Gen Z voters, 19 and 20 year old college students, Republicans and Democrats."
"Well, they're all members of the COVID generation, students whose high school years were disrupted by the pandemic."
How did COVID affect your education and your view of the world?
"Once COVID was over, it was like building up in me during the period of lockdown and then once it ended, I was ready to go out there and make a difference."
Let's go back to the beginning of June before the debate on June 27th.
The choices were Joe Biden and Donald Trump at that time.
"I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and something that's very important for us is every, the lives of the unborn and protecting the lives of the unborn because they're innocent."
So my mother worked at a college up in Prescott.
"What do you think of the tone of the ads you're seeing, whether Republican, Democrat or other?"
"I think it's deception, honestly, and so I think what they could do instead of getting with a lot of these influencers and doing stuff like that is promise to put Gen Z and younger people in higher positions when they start a presidential administration to actually do a lot of good work for Gen Z because they wield the power of the executive branch."
"The pushing with Kamala with more current things like Chaperone and Charlie XCX when it comes to more pop culture stuff, I don't really agree with that."
I like Charlie XCX.
"So that's what I've seen from the ads and I think that's something the left does really well and that's something the right, the Republican, we really have to work on is that emotional appeal of like, okay, this really matters and this is why."
I completely agree with you in terms of brat and all these kind of Gen Z marketing.
"What do you wish, based on what you've heard tonight, that Carson and Faith understood about you, your side?"
So why are Gen Z voters so important this year?
" Now, fears of a wider war in the Middle East are being felt also in the United States, including by Lebanese-American Mayor Abdullah Hamoud of Dearborn, Michigan, a state that's home to the nation's largest Arab-American population."
And Hamoud tells Michel Martin about the growing voter disaffection in his community and what it would take to restore their trust in the upcoming presidential election.
"Mayor Abdullah Hamoud, thank you so much for speaking with us."
Thank you so much for having me.
"You are the first person of Arab descent to be elected mayor of Dearborn, which I think might be surprising to some people, given that Dearborn is a majority, you know, Arab-Muslim city."
And Dearborn is a place in which I'm raising my own family.
"And for me, running for Dearborn, for mayor of Dearborn, was about the opportunity to improve the quality of life for all of our residents."
"In fact, our mantra was running to be the best, to demonstrate that, you know, regardless of the direction in which I pray, the direction in which I lead is a strong direction and the direction in which that can uplift all the communities across the city of Dearborn."
"As we are speaking now, it's been a year since the October 7th, you know, Hamas attack on southern Israel and all that has transpired since then."
"As we are speaking now, there is an aggressive military campaign going on in Lebanon, where your parents are from."
"You know, for many Americans across this country, when they see the images of video surfacing all over social media, to them it's just images of strangers."
"For us here in the city of Dearborn, these are images of close family and friends, which makes that pain all the closer to us."
And so that's why I think I have a responsibility to speak up and use a platform I have to hopefully push for a change and course on what has been unfolding across the Middle East for as long as I've been alive.
"She was trying to escape her home in Lebanon and as she was walking out with her children, she was advancing to the car when a bomb had just dropped on the car and killed her in front of her children."
We had an instance where right now my stepsister is trapped in Lebanon and she has not been able to find a flight to come back to America where she lives with her husband and with her children.
I've had residents come when we first pushed the first ceasefire resolution for what's unfolding across Gaza to speak to the calamity that has struck their family.
One resident in the Pacific spoke to losing over 70 or 80 family and loved ones.
"And unfortunately, as I described months ago, many in the city of Dearborn don't sleep."
"And I think that's what is top of mind for so many residents, not only in Dearborn, all across the globe."
"One of the reasons I think people know you, even if they don't live in or near Dearborn, is that you wrote an op-ed for the New York Times back in February where you described this sense of betrayal."
Many of us here in the city supported President Biden and his election efforts versus then President Donald Trump on the hope that he would bring morality and decency back to the White House.
"But what we have seen unfold over the last 11 months, the number, the numerous war crimes that have been committed, we have seen a president who has been unwilling to distance himself from the war criminal, Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet."
"That's why we feel so betrayed, that our president rather choose and side with Benjamin Netanyahu over the American people."
Has any of that changed?
We are at the cusp of a regional war unfolding across the entire Middle East.
"And what I would tell you right now is, you know, over 60 percent of Americans support an arms embargo against the Israeli government."
"Yet we have a president that has not moved on this issue, has just been unveiled that both USAID and the State Department have provided the report to the White House administration that Israel, the Israeli government did block humanitarian aid, which would permit now the American government from withholding weapons distribution towards the Israeli government, which it had not done."
"In fact, Secretary Blinken went to Congress and said anything but the truth."
I think what we are trying to do and trying to understand is the center of America has moved on the issue of Israel and Palestine.
And what we'd love to see now is essential the Democratic Party to move as well.
"One of the reasons you also came to public attention back in February is that there has been a movement to encourage people to vote in the primaries, to vote uncommitted as an expression of their disagreement with the administration over its stance toward Israel and the Gaza war."
"And there were significant numbers of people in both Wisconsin and Michigan, who are both important battleground states that did choose to vote sort of uncommitted."
"This is hotly debated across the community, whether it be at the Arab community, the Muslim community or the anti-war community at large."
And I think that is the most catastrophic thing come November.
You have many of folks who are still in Vice President Harris' camp.
But I think what you're finding is the coalition that was built by Joe Biden to defeat Donald Trump four years ago is not tightly knit together.
It has been fractured because of the course that they have taken on the issue of Gaza and more broadly speaking across Palestine and Lebanon today.
"To the point of the third parties that you mentioned, a recent Reuters poll showed that 40 percent of Arab and Muslim voters in Michigan are now backing the Green Party candidate Jill Stein."
And Michigan was really important to Joe Biden's victory in 2020.
"I mean, Michigan is one of those states that went to Trump in 2016."
"The fact that Biden was able to win Michigan byâ€”well, in, you know, 150,000 votes, not huge, given you're talking about millions of voters, was part of the reason that he is president now."
"But the fact is, Mr. Mayor, Jill Stein is not going to be president of the United States."
"So is this move toward Jill Stein, is that a political strategy?"
"And I understand that come November, you really have one of two choices over who is going to win this election."
"Be it Vice President Harris or former President Trump, I want to understand electoral politics that we have at play."
"They want a president who not only advocates for an assault weapons ban here in the states, but also ensures that we don't have cabinet members of the Israeli government passing out assault weapons to radical settlers killing Palestinians each and every single day."
"They want to support a president who understands that we have to end mass shooting at schools, but also holds accountable a government that decimated every university across Gaza."
We care about universal health care and we care about what's happening in Gaza.
We care about ensuring a green new future and what's unfolding in Yemen.
We care about centering worker and union's rights and also wanting to understand what's unfolding in Yemen.
"And so I think that's what you're hearing from folks who are going towards a third party candidate, be it Stein or someone else."
"They don't want the simple message that Donald Trump is awful, which he is."
People want an inspirational reason to come out to the ballot come November.
"There's a group called the Uncommitted National Movement, which is a coalition of people who supported the idea of voting uncommitted in the primaries."
"And last week, the movement announced it won't endorse Kamala Harris, but they did urge supporters to vote against Trump and avoid third party candidates."
"Yeah, I can't speak to the thought process that went into the messaging behind the Uncommitted National Movement's announcement."
"What I can tell you, though, is when you have conversations at the doorsteps with residents here in the city of Dearborn, where my primary concern is, there's a difference in belief."
"And if we recall the 2016 election, it wasn't that Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton by roughly 11000 votes in Michigan in 2016."
The message that I have is I endorse you voting come November.
"You are a Democrat yourself, but your position now is officially as mayor, as a nonpartisan position, if I have that right, right?"
I don't know if you've talked to the Harris campaign about this or if they've reached out to you.
"For the last 20 years of my life, Arab Americans and Muslim Americans have made secondary the issues of foreign affairs."
"I can't tell you that between Bush, Obama, Trump or Biden, that we have had alignment or agreement on their global policies."
"What you're hearing now in this election that's different is I have been the first to say and I put so in my op ed, the transformative policies of President Biden are likened to those of Lyndon B. Johnson or FDR."
"You're talking about 2.2 million people where 100 percent are displaced, whether you're looking to the health ministry numbers or the Lancet Journal publication, the deaths are somewhere between 40,000 and 180,000, the majority of which are women and children, and 90 percent of civilian infrastructure has been decimated."
The U.N. estimates place that it would take over a decade just to eliminate the rubble and it would take multiple decades to rebuild.
We see what's happening now in the West Bank where the El Jazeta offices have been shuttered for the next 45 days.
We see the expansion of the war throughout Lebanon.
Has the Harris campaign reached out to you or have you reached out to them?
There have been many conversations when we first started with the Biden administration leading into with Harris Harris campaign individuals.
We have to understand that Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet are not looking to end this conflict.
I guess what I'm saying is it's a known quantity who's made it very clear that he stands solidly with Israel.
I know that he's promised and he has asserted that he will bring Middle East peace.
"And so then the question becomes, what if Mr. Trump wins and all the things that you have supported and worked for and care about are undone?"
I am doing all that I can to prevent Donald Trump from being reelected.
"Not because Dearborn residents are asking for it, not because Arab Americans and Muslim Americans are asking for it, because the center of the party that represents the center of this country has moved on its issues, whether it's an arms embargo, pursuing a ceasefire, ending the conflicts overseas."
These are all things that everyday Americans are calling for.
"And so if we can uphold that value and heed the concerns of Americans from coast to coast, we can work collectively to rebuild the coalition to prevent the reelection of Donald Trump."
"That's why you see a muddy draw out from the uncommitted national movement on messaging, because we understand what Donald Trump represents."
We understand that ultimately you have a binary choice come this November.
"Before you let you go, Mr. Mayor, how what you are juggling a lot of things and a family in addition to being mayor and in addition to trying to comfort, support and advocate for people."
"And that, you know, a name like mine of the last and what is as American as any other in the city like Dearborn is the greatest American city because we are so diverse and beautiful."
And I take my lead from them and I lean on them and these moments of difficulty because that's what Dearborn does.
"Mayor Abdullah Hamoud, Mayor of Dearborn, thank you so much for speaking with us."
Thank you so much for having me.
"Well, according to 538 National Polling, Donald Trump is leading Kamala Harris as the preferred president, 48% to 46%."
Joining us now is New York pollster and founder of John Zogby Strategies.
"John Zogby, thank you so much for joining us on Power Hour."
"Hi Gabriel, how are you?"
Thank you for joining us.
What's your assessment firstly of where they're at at the moment when you look at Donald Trump and Kamala Harris?
"And you know, there may be an event and Kamala Harris gets a bump and another assassination attempt, Donald Trump gets a bump."
A Quinnipiac University national poll showed that Donald Trump is just ahead at 48% to Kamala Harris is 47%.
But then CNN's latest findings showed that Kamala Harris is at 48% and Mr. Trump is at 47%.
"I mean, in the sense that given the way our electoral college is structured, Kamala Harris needs to be at least three and a half to four percentage points ahead of Donald Trump because of the popular vote, she gets a lot of extra votes, popular votes in California and Illinois and New York, large states."
"It all comes down to seven states, Southern Rim, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia."
And then what we call the Northern Wall.
"And that is Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania."
"For example, while when Joe Biden was still in, the anticipation was that the Democrats would lose the Southern Rim, which meant then that Joe Biden would have to win all three of the Northern Wall and then pick up two more electoral votes, one in Nebraska and one in Maine."
Both candidates are putting a lot of time in Pennsylvania.
It is Pennsylvania.
The path to victory is through Pennsylvania.
"Do you expect there's gonna be a big shift in the polls between now and November five, or is it going to stay as close as it is at the moment?"
"Well, you know, look at in a world where anything can happen in US politics, anything has already happened several times."
A pollster is undercounting Donald Trump's voter support.
"Yeah, you know, there are some pollsters, I think, who under represent Republicans."
"And my experience, and it's 40 years now, Republicans appear to be less likely to answer the phone or to respond to surveys."
"Folks like me, I've always adjusted my sample and applied in a little extra weight, you know, to make sure that Republicans are equitably, not equally necessarily, but equitably represented to reflect, you know, how people have voted in presidential elections."
And sometimes I do see some of the big name pollsters coming in with samples that over sample Democrats and under sample Republicans.
"Okay, look, an NBC national news poll put Kamala Harris's favorability jumping 16 points since July."
"Well, you know, the book on Kamala Harris was that she was a do-nothing vice president, that the White House itself didn't trust her, and that she was harsh."
We'll have to chat again between now and November 5.
Thank you so much for joining us on Tower Hour.
