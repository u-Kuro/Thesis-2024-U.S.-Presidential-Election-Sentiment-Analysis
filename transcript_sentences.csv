People disparage like a history degree.

They want to save our country.
"And you see it on this question, too, on our Biden's policies, the Biden administration policies helping or hurting your family."
"But the measure in between, the people in between are really going to make the difference in this election."
They got crushed in the suburbs.
And I think that's what some people are worried about with the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania.
Subscribe to the channel.

"These messages are tailored to appeal to a broad range of voters, including those in rural areas who may have supported Trump in the past."
"Make sure to like, comment, and subscribe for more election news and updates."

"I just been here to talk Pennsylvania politics with you all day, but man, you got a lot of critical races."
So a couple of things that we learned while we were inside is that when votes are tabulated they go up into a very secure wired system into a locked room on a server.

"At this point, it almost doesn't matter."
"Chris, you might recall you were the one who led the Fox decision desk to call Arizona for Biden on election night."

"I've been in those arenas, and people have a great time at those arenas."

"On October 2nd, Trump returned to Pennsylvania to hold two rallies in Scranton and Reading."
"How is this going to play in your view with suburban women voters, particularly there in Pennsylvania, that Trump has got to make inroads with if he wants to be successful?"
Go ahead.
Seems like the third party candidates are going to be on the ballot in a lot of these swing states where they can kind of play spoiler.
"There's still an inside straight she could get, but largely if Trump takes Pennsylvania, he's got this."
"Natasha, back to you."
I was a little surprised today.
It is a crazy thing to do and you shouldn't do it no matter who you want to win.
That was the lowest number we ever had in the recorded history of our country.
"She was elected on the second ballot, beating out someone from Southern Arizona who's also a pretty strong Trump supporter."
"But overnight, a draft report of the so-called air quotes audit by a group calling itself the Cyber Ninjas found that not only did Donald Trump lose Arizona, but he lost by even more votes than previously realized."

"But right now you're not these are bad numbers for Democrats because like I said, it's not just you know, it's a drop off from both parties."
He could be out there picking up litter trash.
"Democrats concerned about the southern border are rooting for Senator Mark Kelly, who represents the border state of Arizona."
"After all, she's been vice president, a U.S. senator, a state attorney general, a district attorney."
So we'll see what happens in terms of that.
"And when you have these all these small little counties that have 20 30,000 votes, sometimes 40."
And I saw where the engines came down.
"Now, I would never stand in line for these atrocities with the direct sunlight."
"And of course they do the thing where we've added all like he says the, this is the strongest economy."
That's well above what it is in terms of Pennsylvania as a whole.
But everybody's aware of it.
I'm just tired of it.
And it was big.
Now let's go back to the McDonald's and see Trump in action.
"Yeah, the president is going to be in Pennsylvania for three days."
You don't want that to happen while the war in Europe is still going on because then you've got a bigger problem on your hands.
It should be very easily handled by the military.
We had a great economy.
Surely there's other metrics out there that show Harris having a victory.
"Wisconsin, I would say it's similar to Pennsylvania."
 Brand new polling is showing that Donald Trump is surging in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.
So great to see a substantive conversation between the two campaigns on something like this.
"Allentown, some of your viewers might remember the Billy Joel song from the 80s, that's not Allentown anymore."
We'll let the lawyers decide if what he said was treason.
"You can see, look, 43.51 for Trump, that's negative."
"Number one, I see a lot of you are taking photos."
That's a pretty good thing to run on.
And apparently he is going to round up undocumented immigrants in the country as well.
Or is he just a reminder that she's part of the current administration?
Bloomberg is coming.
Do not boo.
"They stopped doing it about a year ago because under Kamala Harris's rising grocery prices, they just can't afford any more with their grandkids that they're raising."
She lost.
" 15 states, plus the 2nd congressional districts in Nebraska and Maine, are potentially in play this November for either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump."
"Harris up five points on Donald Trump, Wisconsin Harris up just one point."
That's not going to happen and we know it but Kamala Harris does have a Pennsylvania problem and we can discuss it and we're going to discuss it at length in this video.
Just nothing has really come out that has really been worth discussing.
"And some key players there, they're not convinced she has the right kind of experience or connections to really win over the city."
I don't always put the full quote in an article.
Kamala Harris is making clear that she gets how to win Pennsylvania.
This is your home.
"That's why the off year elections in particular is tough to pull because you don't know, man."
"But this is interesting and this happens, of course, on many stories, including out of Washington, the Biden administration is now appearing to walk back that fairly straightforward statement."
"Because if you say you value human rights, public safety, the truth, but you're willing to set them aside for what you think will be lower taxes and less federal red tape or whatever other benefits you expect to get from a Trump administration versus a Harris administration, if you're willing to set all of those values aside for those things, I don't think you really value those things at all."
Hi.
Erie.
"Look, people say, be nice."
But what about all the other people who vote in Pennsylvania?
This was part of the deal that the Trump team reached with the Biden team.
So let's help this poor man do that.
Mm.
As Newsom did.
"I mean, to catch everybody up on who Carrie Lake is, just over a decade ago, she donated to Barack Obama."
"That was the same Mark Fincham, who was at the Capitol on January the 6th, speaking this weekend at Donald Trump's big lie-filled Arizona rally."
"That's like, you know this person they don't know how to speak or this person is, you know He's quiet."
Maybe that's why they're off by so much that doesn't explain a Biden plus seven just two weeks before Election Day.
That's a runaway Trump train.
I felt great.
"Well, it's a great question."
What are you hearing and seeing?
"In Pennsylvania, Harris announced a plan to give black men more economic opportunities and described some of her opponent's behavior as increasingly unhinged."
Elections are very complicated.
This could potentially impact the number of valid mail-in ballots that are counted.
"I am here with my colleague Dan Snyder here from CBS Philadelphia, and we set out, Dan, to try to get a pulse post-verdict if anyone swung one way or another."
"But the people I spoke with are confident that the way the numbers have dumped in so far, they say they are confident that the president Trump will in fact take the state of Arizona, keeping it red."
I've seen you been faced a lot of opposition.
"Trafalgar, four point shift."
"I mean, they are swing states because they are balanced on the edge of a knife."
"He says, well, eight or maybe even nine of the keys should go to Donald Trump under your schema and it seems rather random, rather..."
"And so kind of how that all plays out, obviously, I don't know yet."
"Yeah, that's malignant narcissism right there."
"Okay, Hunter Woodall, thanks so much for your perspective on this."
"So again, so long as they work hard and play by the rules, every single one of our citizens should be able to heat their home in the middle of a cold winter night."
You had a prime time speaking slot.
"We've got the most accurate, most accurate, most accurate, most accurate, most accurate party ID popular vote model along with the most accurate just poll in general on the popular vote in 2020 for three straight months now saying Trump's plus three."
" Well, joining us now is former senior adviser to Donald Trump, Christian Witten."
"So if Donald Trump were to win Pennsylvania, he really wouldn't need much more, just 16 electoral votes."
"I never looked out into it, but You literally messing your whole life over because You mad for what you know?"
"Since yesterday, a lot of things have come to light."
"The sixth poll was conducted between September 20 and 24 by Beacon Research, Shaw and Company Research among 775 likely voters."
"Do you think it's going to be Shapiro at this point, Mike?"
"Of course, Donald Trump and I believe there were problems in 2020."
We'd love to hear from you.
They don't feel they need them.
Trump's also touting his tariff policy and vowing to take on the CCP.
"So if the Harris campaign can't win over Philly, they're in big trouble."
"We can take Baltimore and with people like Kim Klasek, we will take Baltimore."
"So they probably put out generic ballot polling, maybe I'm not sure."
So that was probably the most damaging thing that came out of that for people who generally just voted in presidential elections.
What would winning Arizona and Nevada mean for his campaign?
"Donald Trump won in 2016 by about 44,000 votes."
"Well, this is kind of emerging of two things, right?"
He went to college in the state.
"But again, I am somebody who obviously we know where I stand politically."
"Brad, what's your motto?"
"Calls for the Arizona attorney general to resign if, among other things, he's not going to prosecute the state's fake electors."
She's a Democrat.
They take in the geese.
"On the map meanwhile, it will be lean Democratic for now."
"Like in Easton, where Jackie Kroll today is watching her grandson."
On you.
What what would happen when Elon Musk took over Twitter.
"Pennsylvania for her is considered a big important state, because there are other states that may be out of reach in that battleground state alignment."
I think I'm much better.
You're golden.
"Actually, being a human being, I'm not in favor of that sort of thing."
I bet.
The one X factor that has happened that we've seen a sizable electoral reverberance with is the Dobbs decision.
"Yeah, well, there's some history to this."
"So, Lindsay, anyone from Pennsylvania will tell you that the eastern part of the state is more east coast, more mid-Atlantic."
"Thank you, Jodie."
Stay safe.
"They've even voted the same way in every gubernatorial election since 1994, except one."
Get your you know what app and vote.
"Saying, this is very common, okay, we always get complaints about it, but no, political says no, no, no."
Did you see the way that sucker landed?
But everybody else actually gets something for their vote.
"I mean, this is a four day span."
"And in fact, when you look at the early voting data voter registration polling everything, it all looks bad for Democrats."
"Oh, I thought it was coming from the necklace."
The other pollsters fared worse ranging outside their margins of error between 4 and 6 points.
What can allow you for consumer protection?
"And given the assassination attempt, sort of the the entire the strengthening of Trump's base and sort of the invigoration into the campaign ever since that attempt, I think that that's something that I said has become very symbolic for the Republican Party."
"Charleroi, the town that Trump references in that clip, is a town in southwestern Pennsylvania."
"You got a convention in about 10 days, debate September 10th."
This is not how it used to be.
"While Kamala Harris enjoys a steady support on several fronts, when it comes to key issues like immigration and economy, several polls have shown that the voters are leaning towards Donald Trump as the preferred president to deal with these issues."
None of the guardrails will be here in the second term.
"That facility, along with many others in Arizona, are recipients of ChIPS Act funding, which former President Trump has criticized on occasion."
A reduction in consumption of meat.
But now what Pennsylvania voters are looking at is Donald Trump's awful track record on manufacturing jobs and his awful job record overall.
"You know, I do a PG show."
And your parents.
"Well, get this."
" The election of November 3rd, 2020 in Maricopa County was free, fair and accurate."
I've played lots of games offline.
They got the shooter.
"It was 72%, now it's 65%."
Donald Trump just survived getting his ears pierced at Claire's.
"I mean, yeah, they missed some states here and there, but that was an accurate if you look and you're in the polling business, 2022 was considered a good year for polls."
"And so at this point, we need to realize that this consistent and even escalating call for these so called audits or election reviews are no longer about reviewing the 2020 election."
So we're on the completion side.
"The court's ruling in Pennsylvania thus represents a pivotal moment in this ongoing debate, as it underscores the Republican's commitment to reinforcing election security."
I know all about the marbles.
We go watch her play.
I'm non-binary.
This is certainly a fair assessment.
Opportunity.
"Nationally, I think his ceiling is probably 46% this time around with all the third party candidates."
"Also, there's always Unfortunately amongst a lot of immigrant groups like even people whose heritage immigrated here, you know, whatever They'll be anti-immigrant themselves even I think a lot of the Mexicans right now so a very very unfortunate scenario there, but that is kind of the caveat but The only other thing is this does provide you a possibility, right?"
And Kelly Armstrong basically has won the governorship in North Dakota with her or his primary win.
How did you rate those different questions on foreign policy?
They're the generic ballot in the House.
Look at this on the first day of the request.
"But I think at the end of the day, whatever the polls say on election day is gonna be your biggest guide."
So what was the deal with that?
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 49% each.
But that pause came with an odd price tag.
They're anxious.
"Whether you're a Harris supporter or a Trump backer, make sure your voice is heard."
"Even Aniskoff, with all her experience, she can't work miracles."
"But I think, you know, his floor in the Rust Belt states is probably going to be around 47 to 48 as opposed to, you know, a ceiling of 46, right?"
"Let's move the, see these votes, you've got about a million votes in there."
So she knows a thing or two about connecting with voters.
Fifty five percent of four Harris versus college students would still in this case.
But can she actually pull it off?
Why why if I get an abortion if a woman gets an abortion?
"That's the more blue-collar, connected kind of Republicans that are on the North side."
How the hell does that work?
We have sixty thousand Democratic voters who are voting uncommitted in the primary.
The only state that's more of a dog fight than Pennsylvania is actually North Carolina.
"I just want more but Burgos who chairs the Latinos con Harris, which I think is gendered."
They will get him.
I just want you to understand that means that we don't know.
Every other poll in Wisconsin shows something different.
God protect that black church in South Carolina from Dindlin Roof?
And that's the problem here.
"However, in 2020, Biden made significant inroads in the suburbs, particularly among college-educated voters, helping him reclaim the state."
"And get everyone you know, because we want to take back our country."
7.
"We've seen that in Pennsylvania, and I believe it will continue to be a motivating issue and people will reject the candidate."
"Why it's Chester, Pennsylvania."
"We have to you know, take a look ourselves But you know and there's there's constantly all these You know rumors flying about the private deliberations between the two leaders and the fraught relationship that they have so that is tentative if true Yes That's a you know somewhat of a relief I would say for US officials that were pressing that both privately and of course as we heard from Biden in public Much to the dismay of some Israeli officials who didn't want to be instructed on how to conduct this retaliation So it does I think relieve a little bit of pressure But I think we have to be reminded that this isn't you know, everything is is all good between the two powers there They're allies You know the US is at pains to continue to say, you know This is all for Israel's defense as you heard from Hagar Shemali You know, this is to send a message in addition to actually provide the resources needed to finish this war But you know, there will still be disagreements And I think the US has been honest about that even in public that you know They don't always agree and they're being candid with each other Which the subtext is, you know, this isn't a great relationship a warming of ties But it is something that they both sides want to move forward and finish this off Well, we certainly have seen a market reaction to the reporting from the Washington Post oil futures are down more than 4% Right now WTI lower by nearly five full percentage points south of seventy two dollars a barrel once again So when we consider the political impact here for the Biden administration Why they had been encouraging a less escalatory move from Israel not going after energy or nuclear sites for example It was because of concern about how Iran could respond and disrupt potentially global energy markets right or at least a factor and stability Has been the name of the game since you know a year ago when the October 7th attacks happened It's a US desperately just wants to bring down the temperature and in any way we can on all these fronts You know, of course, we've got Hezbollah with defeat of Hamas All you know in the balance now oil is a significant portion of this story and you can see as you mentioned the market reaction Underscores just how sensitive these conversations are about how Israel retaliates even if the US continues to say it's justified"
And basically just sloganeers the entire time.
That's what this campaign is about.
And I think that's going to be on full display on Tuesday.
"And so I just, again, like I said, to me, Kamala seems to be really on from an issue standpoint, talking about all of the issues that she was already talking about that she, and she's really appealing to this demo just thematically and through a commitment to rule of law and the constitution and character."
"You just got to look it up and you just go, it's just a joke."
And part of that is diversifying where you're getting your news from.
"If it is as close as again as it was in 2020, it could take a while, especially with mail-in ballots."
He's going back today.
But this is the one thing we could do that would change Pennsylvania's future.
I want to see taxes go down I want to see the economy better housing.
"And I think as Reuben mentioned, you need to make a plan."
That number is just 58 percent for Vice President Harris.
And I think that is the most catastrophic thing come November.
And it's kind of illustrative as to his thoughts on the abortion issue in general.
Will you commit now to respecting and encouraging a peaceful transfer of power?
Like when I'm not exaggerating when I say this is Def Con one for Dems.
"But are they just inundating the airwaves with lies about Trump or is that is the is the Trump campaign, the RNC?"
Harris is now more viewed positively according to this poll in Pennsylvania.
"Pennsylvania, the decisive battleground state, is where both leading candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, are intensifying their campaigns with different strategies and policies."
So that's why we're talking to you tonight.
So we definitely don't want her in.
"It was like an explosion, like a rocket, like Elon's rocket."
"So even though the voter registration numbers might be lower and the state might be becoming more Republican as far as registration, the actual vote totals are still favoring the Democratic side."
And I also thought it was interesting.
"Yeah, most polling has Harris up by the narrowest narrowest of margins maybe one to two points So within the margin of error essentially it could go either way with the margin of error It's arguable that Donald Trump actually has the lead You could ask me this question every day from now until November 5th And I think the answer will be the same either candidate could really plausibly win it a small shift at any point Right up to election day could really change the outcome We start wondering what causes one campaign or the other to break out if anything They're both still laying out new policy proposals today Kamala Harris aiming a series of proposals that young black men with business incentives an effort to legalize Cannabis on the federal level Donald Trump continues to introduce tax deductions."
Their polling aggregator is a little bit different than Nate Silver's model.
His appeal.
A win there could be a big indication of just who will win the election overall.
"My grandmother would sometimes say, you know what?"
Do you have any sense of where this is going?
"And he goes, yeah, I love him."
But I don't think it's going to work very well.
They're coming after meat eating.
But it's good.
So we'll have to wait and see on that front.
"But now not only is he not doing any harm, he's doing a lot of good for the Kamala Harris campaign."
"With just 35 days left until the 2024 US presidential election, the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is heating up, especially in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state."
It was not a toss up when Joe Biden was still in it.
It's bought and sold already the deals are done.
Let me know if you agree or not But it's so wild to hear him mention the cia man like We know uh speaking of real or fake.
I've been canceled for it.
What do you have on that?
Trump can't really rise above.
Our elections last forever.
"Like, if he loses it, yeah, of course, there are many pathways for Trump here."
So let's start with a race that's been called the GOP Senate nomination.
"About 55% say legal, 40% say illegal."
It's only 53 percent say amnesty for CNN.
And I thank all of the leaders here for being a part of that.
"Yeah, it's it is scary to stand in that crowd and hear them cheer for locking up poll workers and election officials from 2020."
"Hi, Senator Vance, Rachel Louise Joes with ABC 15 Arizona."
"And in this situation, I think it's more likely Pennsylvania's numbers are off."
"Like you probably be out there with Joe Biden over Hebra beach and Delaware, which is right there."
"And what what her campaign is saying is the more she talks about it, the better she is doing on this and more so that you talk to voters and they're becoming increasingly familiar with her."
"But the argument that was made by the GOP was that, sure, Kamala Harris could re-inspire the Democratic base, but Trump would re-inspire the Republican base even more against Harris than Trump."
I don't think nuclear politics is a nonpartisan site.
Who is this person?
"That does make Virginia our first state to lean towards Harris here, raising her electoral vote tally up to 209, though she still trails Trump's 228's as we head on up to the Midwest region."
"Biden carried it by one percentage point in 2020, making Erie County kind of a bellwether."
The guy from Arizona is... that's an intriguing figure.
But then RFK Jr.
"The New York times as Trump served up McDonald's fries, vitriol boiled outside."
These are where they think they can get a pool of voters who Potential voters who may stay home or maybe though they're gettable.
We're going to have to wait and see what happens there with that.
"Technically, you don't own your steam games."
"And the numbers not only are consistent, but they come from some of the best pollsters in Pennsylvania, a state that will matter the most in this election."
So maybe I think four.
The evidence showed that Nancy Pelosi should have had protection at the Capitol that I offered her and they turned it down.
It's so negative.
I get caught 15 years.
"And she's someone who could really energize voters, get them excited about Harris."
He's mad at Howard Stern.
They just haven't met that higher standard that we can verify at this point.
"But just in general, with the note, no more crazy pandemic, we're not going to be dealing with that environment."
"Yeah, yeah."
"When you get the Medal of Honor, generally speaking, and I've met many of them and I've seen the families of many of them."
"However, the Pennsylvania or the Wisconsin polls happen getting closer."
Even local Republicans said it was not true and now the people of Florida are dealing with another devastating storm and I want you to watch what happens over the next few days just like the last time.
"You know, I would, I would tell you the greatest thing about this industry, plain and simple is you can be an 18 year old kid."
They're the reason dr. Oz lost the Senate race.
I just want to add to that.
Kamala laughing with joy and spreading enthusiasm and love for America.
Jason.
"On the real politics average, she's ahead by Trump is ahead by zero point two percent."
"Here in Lancaster County, Biden lost by double digits, so his team is not expecting to flip this area blue, but they do hope he can lose by less here this time around to help his bottom line."
"Now, they headed out with a lot of important questions, and as you might imagine, they listened to a lot of political opinions."
Now he's trying to withstand a challenge by another Trump backed contender.
"However, the result of elections continue to increase more and more for the Democrats, showing that these non-affiliated voters are more likely to vote Democratic."
"I mean, exit polls right now show a record percentage of Latino vote share as a share of the total votes that were cast in this election."
"Of course they've been wrong by, I mean, we've seen the final aggregate poll where you average out all of them be wrong by seven or eight points in swing States like Wisconsin in 2020 and 2016."
I would just lean into it and use it as a marketing campaign.
"I think it's certainly possible for Quinnipiac in this poll to not be accurately representing Trump's stage of support in Pennsylvania, while at the same time acknowledging the fact that Harrison may have a slight lead in the state."
I wouldn't go there no matter what.
You heard from other.
I say them pronouns.
None of these are Pennsylvanians like the top three candidates are not really Pennsylvanians.
They each backed Trump or Joe Biden in 2020 by at least 10 percentage points.
But it will be hard.
So let's look at some of the possibilities for her.
What the hell?
And what are they saying?
"For us here in the city of Dearborn, these are images of close family and friends, which makes that pain all the closer to us."
"In terms of former President Trump, he is I mean, he's going all around the country holding tons of rallies and he's sticking to this message that, you know, Kamala Harris will destroy this nation if she's elected."
"It's 19 votes without it, Democrats will lose the election."
This is the news.
You know that it's the new thing.
"It does, doesn't it?"
"There are some Democrats being very vocal, others speaking on background, but they're worried about Harris's momentum."
"I mean, the interest rates are super high."
"Obviously, Biden hoping to do that in a way that is to his electoral advantage."
Let me be very clear.
"Well, that all changed in 2016."
"I agree with you, brother."
Talk about an iconic moment at the DNC.
"My first day in office, I signed an executive order doing away with the college degree requirement for 92% of state government jobs, opening up the doors of opportunity for people not based on an arbitrary degree requirement, but whether they did the skills in the military, in a trade union, you name it, to do the job, making sure that we're bringing VOTEC back to our classrooms, investing in union apprenticeship programs, making sure that middle class families keep more money in their pocket because we're cutting taxes along with all the other work that's being done at the federal level."
"Obviously, you need every demographic."
Donald Trump's most efficient path to 270 electoral college votes would be to win the Sun Belt swing states of North Carolina and Georgia and flip Pennsylvania.
But you know how Wikipedia is there in the bag for Kamala Harris and they're going to purposely be so they're going to purposely be slow about it.
So we are running like I.E.
They're evil.
What would you say to that?
"So yeah, y'all got it."
"And yes, that's true, you have to give people something to vote for."
reboot
I'm curious how that strikes your ears.
Oh my God.
But it was a much more confused...
It's like the only MLK line Republicans have ever read.
"And, Tam, we just have a few seconds to put a button on it."
She really is.
"But this particular issue, I think that what Kamala Harris has done is she has used programs that are meant to help people who are escaping tyranny."
Biden and Clinton were winning these polls by a lot more.
"You only win the state by 80, 90 K. It's not an apples to apples comparison, but it still does make sense that if they had such a bigger voter registration advantage and they were only able to win the state by like a point now imagine considering how much it's condensed."
It is really fascinating.
It's like trying to nail jelly to a wall.
He lost the election and he shouldn't be in the White House.
"Well, sir, do you want to play your song and then greet a few people?"
"The vast majority of people in Georgia said no, even though statistically it's somewhat close, not that wages have overstripped and compensated in all respects for inflation, but it's much closer than people perceive."
People didn't like her.
Let me show you what McCormick said.
"Now I say surprisingly because Wisconsin is right trending both fundamentally and demographically, devoted to the rights of Michigan and Pennsylvania in both 2016 and 2020, and is wider, more rural and has a lower proportion of college-educated residents, 3 demographic factors that do favor the GOP."
"So hypothetically speaking, if we have 100,000 mail-in ballots, we have to deal with double the amount of envelopes, which is a long process."
"All types of America doesn't have a gun problem, it has a black problem."

"So please tap your screen now, subscribe and donate to The Real News Network."
"Tim, this is something that we've been looking forward to for a long time, so I'm really excited to talk to you about this today."
You can see this is the updated count.
Why did you vote early this year?
"Favorability, the catch-all for what voters think about the candidates from policy to personality to promise, tips Harris way since we last polled Pennsylvanians."
Donald Trump sees that as an enemy.
"But as we just heard from Steve at the top here, voters have a more favorable view of the Trump years than of the Biden years right now."

Donald Trump created all of these voters.
"So again, it comes down to not just how you experience it, but what you believe is happening in the country that kind of underpins a lot of that vote and why it doesn't move."
What more can you tell us about this one?
And this is totally foreign as an idea or a theory to me.
"Now, listen, we've been talking about this."
"For instance, it's very clear that people do not like JD Vance, they do not like Donald Trump, they like Kamala Harris, but they love Tim Walz, up 14 points in terms of overall net favorables in battleground states."
But even they found Harris up by only three.
"Actually, none of the three surviving states are ones he truly needs to win."
It really does.
"The ads are just everywhere, and also like I said, the choice of those ads were Trump, every ad, immigration, immigration, immigration, immigration, migrant, immigration, and then there were some Dave McCormick ads, which tried to do that thing where he's like, Bob Casey's the real radical on abortion, but from Bob Casey and from Kamala, it was abortion all day long."
"Now, we were energy independent under Trump."
"You're gonna claim that Biden won Pennsylvania by five points, yet you can only get Harris up by four?"

"We also heard in Laura's report, Donald Trump rail against FBI crime statistics."
"I hear echoes of Victor Orban, of Vladimir Putin, of Nicholas Maduro."
It doesn't seem like Republicans are willing to stand up to the pressure.
"Oh yeah, yeah."
What comes out of the White House on that?
I definitely think we will surpass the 2020 numbers.
"Look, since I took office as Secretary in January of 23, we have worked directly with state, federal, and local law enforcement agents, and we've had even folks from the counterterrorism information center here in Arizona and CISA out inspecting our places where we do this work across the state, getting our cybersecurity, physical security agents out there from CISA to give us information and then going out with Tiger teams to help put in the bulletproof glass, do the ramps, do the firewalls in their electronic information technology systems."
"The first survey was conducted by Atlas Intel between September 20th, 25, among one new of its 175 likely voters."

And this poll resulted in an exact tie.
"This has packed a lot of reaction, it has packed a lot of conspiracy theory, it has packed a lot of analysis, people are reacting to it."
Correct me on all that.
I checked in with a few young voters who are politically engaged.
I think Biden hates them all at this point.
"Hey, can you help me get in?"
"So if we want to talk about Democrats improving here, this is where it's pretty good."
"Much to get into, but I want to begin with where we left off late last week."
"No, I mean, no, it doesn't bother me."
"Really listen, even when you disagree."
"That's what this election comes down to and Biden is despised, especially in a state like Michigan and you look at it and Trump is leading the polls every single poll in Michigan, which is pretty much unheard of as well."
But there was a lot of anomalies in Georgia that got straightened out by Brian Kemp and their secretary of state since the 2020 election.
Is it possible the polls are actually spot on or in fact understate Harris a little bit?
"Yeah, you have to run the table everywhere outside of Nevada."
I think everybody is waiting for the next debate.
And I certainly think they should.

My daughter doesn't like to go to very many political events but she wanted to come to this one because it's we just witnessed the first female president of the United States that's what I think we have in Kamala Harris and I also think this is it's a role model for all girls and women in this country.
"Now, there's all these criticisms that people will throw at Dr. Oz and you know, some of them I don't necessarily agree with."
She'll do well in Allegheny County.
Whatever that means.
"In 2020, in Michigan, it was about a bit over five points."
I think that gives opportunity for a better interview.
But this is also something that is important to Trump.
There are reports of it.
You can't explain this to a communist progressive like Kamala Harris because it doesn't affect her.
And here they are almost 1800 US likely voters.
If you can buy local we'll talk to you maybe tomorrow.
"I'm 39 years old, but it's always been a taboo topic."
There he is apparently on the steps.

"Well, obviously there are quite a few developments here in Georgia."
We don't have any evidence for that claim.
"They genuinely or at least want to put this out there so their audience gets placated, oh, Biden's still in the lead."
"Not even just for Republicans, just for the United States, make it as secure and as real and as ripe with as little fraud as possible."
"These numbers just keep tightening up, but things start to shift with the next few polls."
And that's what we saw her do in that interview.
"He's a billionaire, big, uh, real estate tycoon, whatever, but he's still to us, one of us."
Should that worry Republicans?
"And after he was rushed off the stage with blood in his face, a spokesperson said Trump is fine and this is a heinous act."
"Today, for example, Florida Senator Marco Rubio tweeted this deceptively quoted line from Dr. King's I Have a Dream speech without any additional context."
"So that's like a net swing of 240,000 votes."
"Once we get a vote banked, in other words, you vote by mail, we bank your vote."
And so what you've seen are more retail stops.
And that's what President Trump campaign is also looking forward to as well.
"Either way, my YouTube channel is officially the place to be."
"You're not allowed to say that if you're con Harris Latinos con Harris and that is just a bad phrasing, right?"
You just slap an extra cost on it.
What a rally.
"Next, we have a poll from Muhlenberg College conducted between September 16th and 19th."
"Next thing you know, Nick Cage is gonna try to steal the actual Declaration of Independence."
"Well, they're not happy because they thought it was Republican talking boards."
She was talking about it before she was even running.
"The polls in October in Pennsylvania, they sucked both in 2020 and 2016."
"There's another woman in the states talking about how a news page, a blog page was literally making him that what is not by literally a detail in the picture, changing it to black and white just to make it seem that what it's not."
"It's gonna zoom right east of Cleveland, probably does zoom right, you know."
That's exactly what the data is suggesting in Pennsylvania and all around the country.
Why not?
Yeah you make really good points and that is exactly what's happening here is that everybody thought on election night that Arizona would very quickly get the results up and there wouldn't be much dispute about it because they were actually able to start calculating tabulating those ballots mail-in ballots and early ballots about two weeks ago.
"And I think that the Trump McCormick ticket you asked about David McCormick and Bob Casey, there are so many synergies between the Trump to me ticket in 16 and the Trump McCormick ticket."
Secret Service.
"And he's always been unintelligent, etc."
"They've had some, I would say, bad reports, wildly exaggerating, engaging in moral panic over the spread of misinformation over Havana syndrome."
And we're going to we're going to have our choice.
You can lose everything else.
"I want to get granular with you for a moment if I can, Senator."
And I met with the people of Governor Shapiro's team.
"So if you're a Republican, you want Trump to about age, but he's still talking about age because he can't get off his old talking points."
"No, it's been longer than that Hasn't it?"
He's the smartest and the greatest and the richest.
Presumably thinking he's an easier general election opponent to overcome.
"Devastating, because that isn't communism."
I mean the only thing that he didn't do is steal the election for Trump.
"But with Pennsylvania and Georgia, you for sure get 270 if you're Trump."
And that is true.
"If Trump can win Pennsylvania by two or three points, I think it is possible."
But now Europe is just they're up our asses.
And the fact that he has over a 60 percent approval rating here in Pennsylvania.
This is the guy who almost committed what should be an impossible crime to commit.
"And this is the biggest problem Democrats have, and they're not willing to accept it."
And we talk about 2020.
"You've been listening to Vice President Kamala Harris at a campaign rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, delivering some of her sharpest and strongest attacks to date against Donald Trump."
You didn't get to go to Luzerne today.
"In four months, pack your bags because you're going back to where you came from."
"I still think that there is a pathway for Harris, but in the last couple of days, it seems like there has been more data to suggest, uh, yeah, Trump's probably gonna win Pennsylvania."
So what you see happening at the gubernatorial level should not be a replication of what could happen at the state level on the presidential election with the presidential election.
"She is the clear front runner tomorrow, but also would very well be a viable general election candidate if she could broaden her appeal some."
And I want a hell yes.
It really could.
Lead is a poison.
The fluctuating voter preferences make it a battleground every election cycle.
"Well, I care to the fact that it just doesn't seem fair."
Five races.
"But if we believe in freedom, then we should at least agree that such a deeply personal decision should be made by the woman whose body is involved, not by politicians."
"So if you're just joining us, former President Donald Trump has been shot in the ear or the back of the head."
And they sent that list to the attorney general.
That could be fun.
Thank you so much and thank you for your service.
"So Pennsylvania appears to be kind of the main battleground state, although because of the emergence of the Sun Belt, it's actually neutered sort of the impact of Pennsylvania potentially, especially with the in play of North Carolina."
"And now, eight years after he was elected, after all the arguments against Obamacare have been proven to be wrong, and even folks who don't like me sure like that insurance."
Just look at their numbers in 2020.
"All the other swing states, too."
"As a data scientist, it is awesome to see a project like this come through."
Because the number one issue on the minds of Americans is how to make life more affordable again.
Who would determine whether or not a situation was serious enough?
"Listen, in Pennsylvania, we've known for decades that we have an unconstitutional education system for two reasons."
Now it's basically tied Harris with a small margin there.
It never has been.
"And that's what helped Trump to spin his tails about how the election was stolen in, you know, Philadelphia, blah, blah, blah."
She did Fox News.
"Like I agree, he might be a tad more electable than McCormick, but somebody else could also be just as electable."
I think that's a legitimate argument.
"We're looking at a Bernie Moreno victory, even if it is just by a few points, it's still going to happen because that's just very hard to make up in terms of the split ballot voting."
"I guess that's a possibility, but I highly doubt that's going to happen."
"The farmers are doing very badly right now, very, very badly under this administration."
"There's not, you know, many pathways to winning."
"And then I'm going to show you what it looks like when these poll workers come out the front door, people that are working at the elections here."
These are fun ones.
And it might actually be like a five point victory.
"Oh, Maltese loves us."
"You know, I met up with him over this weekend here and he had an event with essentially family and friends."
"No, I think that Biden is a strong pillar for her in a lot of areas."
"But unlike Kamala Harris, I think Trump needs Pennsylvania."
"So if folks out there are concerned about this issue or concerned about costs, but if you're just concerned about keeping a majority in the United States Senate, I hope they will help us by going to bobkasey.com."
"Putin saw that, invaded Ukraine."
"Okay, let's look at the polling right now."
What do we find that happens because of that?
"So, Governor, appropriately, the spilly suburbs and city of Philadelphia gets a lot of attention."
What role does Pennsylvania play in Kamala Harris' presidential campaign?
Our generation turned out in record numbers for President Biden.
"All you do when you go vote is they'll ask you, do you want a Democratic ballot or Republican win?"
"I'm sorry, but that's not enough."
"They stand by Trump's false claim that Joe Biden lost the 2020 election, even if it takes a minute."
"He'll never vote for the Women's Health Protection Act, which is we tried to advance in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision."
Does he really have a Biden doctrine?
"Do not be a mangled, lily livered, nut hook."
They're getting ready to perform tonight live here at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in the United Center.
"It works well and it's a bipartisan system run, as you indicated in the opener, by regular folks like you and me."
"In 2020, she voted for Biden."
"You go to certain parts of Western Pennsylvania, his signs are up and there are very few Harris signs."
I want to ask you a little bit about Kamala Harris.
A series of explosive noises five minutes into the former President's rally here near Pittsburgh.
"So, fellas, you stay up here, just look at this one tape and then you go back and enjoy it."
You want to be a rebel?
Let's let's look at this together.
"Over in Russia, Russia denies there have been indirect talks with Ukraine on halting strikes on civilian infrastructure facilities."
Those are just a few.
Just hold on a second.
Trump plus two.
So how are both sides trying to move the needle in the coming weeks?
"Again, what does that mean?"
How effective do you think this strategy will be and why does she still continue to struggle in gaining the support of young black voters?
"I mean, it gets to fantasy land, doesn't it?"
I've never heard of any such thing.
That's Biden and Harris.
And what I did was front load the columns here that talk about what news people watch.
"The Republicans are really proud Republicans in Arizona, right?"
"And so if they're going in, if they're going to the end of the election with a Gallup poll saying the party ID is plus one Republican, unless there's a deviation from what we've seen the past two and a half decades in US politics, you're going to see Trump probably win the popular vote or at least maybe lose about like a quarter of a point."
"Moving to the sixth poll, also conducted by Quinnipiac University on the same dates with a different 1,738 likely voters, Harris received 50% of the vote, while Trump received 47%."
And the Harris camp also released a new radio ad targeting rural voters in battleground states.
"But it's seemingly that really maybe it affected it a little bit, but we've seen Trump shoot right back up in terms of the betting and those Republican internal polls are not going to be input onto real clear politics or anything like that."
It's for fun.
They were super excited about him being on the ticket.
This election cycle has been all about Donald Trump maintaining and building momentum.
"They're actually more comfortable, right?"
"And to me, the really scary thing is that Oz didn't lose by more."
Keep us updated.
"I think poll after poll that shows the presidential race effectively, you know, a dead heat, shows Senator Casey with a little bit of a lead."
And that's why we're one of the battleground states and probably one of the most important states of this election year.
"She has articulated clear and concise positions on a wide range of topics, from health care and immigration, to foreign policy and climate change."
Donald Trump?
Maybe a lack of understanding about how things work in Pennsylvania.
A new Marist poll released Thursday shows former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are tied in the race for the White House.
Help people get involved and help people work to save America.
"First of all, we are going to fight to lower grocery and housing prices for all of us."
"And one of those states is, of course, your home state of Georgia, where the Georgia State Election Board approved a new rule that would require a hand count of the number of ballots cast on Election Day."
"In the race for the presidency in 2024, both patriotism and bipartisanship will be important."
"Absolutely, sir."
So you go back a long time.
"But in 2020, Joe Biden regained victory through strong campaigning in urban and suburban areas."
And that's what he said about Kathy Barnett.
You're obviously not ready to vote for Kamala Harris I'm sure about that.
Sir.
"One is straight up on policy, more of these voters think that Donald Trump's policies, if he wins seven and 10, would decrease border crossings."
But she's worse than him.
"Ryan Bowyer, who as the first blackhead of the city's building trades council, one of the most powerful labor leaders in the state, this guy says, I have concerns about Nikki Liu."
"She says, please pray for my babies and me."
And that's what this campaign is about.
"I mean you look at Nevada, you look at Georgia, North Carolina, all important states but from the perspective of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, you know for Harris or Trump there's no pathway to the presidency without one or multiple of these states."
And I think many times Democrats have not necessarily embraced an all of the above energy strategy.
"Pennsylvania's strong labor union presence, particularly in the manufacturing sector, has historically leaned democratic."
"So in essence, if they had anything on Trump, they would have used it in 2020."
Was he wounded?
But here's what I want to talk about.
"You and I talked two years ago, almost exactly to the day."
I'm trying to connect with some of those suburban voters in some cases.
"But when she was running for president back in 2019, she agreed that a total fracking ban was necessary."
We need to get people out to vote for Donald Trump.
Bowers outlined the pressure campaign from Trump to try to overturn Biden's win in Arizona despite presenting no evidence of election fraud.
"And I've always been saying this, that Erie picks the winner of Pennsylvania, and then Pennsylvania picks the president."
He has been trying to find a way to claim ownership of this issue without the liability.
What they've done.
"All it did was make them more dangerous and less accessible, especially the people who need it."
They also have some good ads where they go through a lot of Trump's former cabinet members saying he's not fit.
"In the Western part of the state, you'll see in Grand Rapids is an area where Republicans generally do well, but Trump will spend a lot of time simply because it's an area where those voters are a little less sure about him."
"As they begin to play a video there at the Trump rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona, we're going to bring in ABC's Alex Prashay and have a discussion about what we just saw."
The legal victory in Pennsylvania can also help consolidate support among Republicans.
We're also joined very proudly today by a large delegation of our nation's frontline border agents.
I served the Marine Corps in combat.
So who knows?
"A huge, huge, huge ad reservation dump, one that will benefit the Democratic Party quite tremendously in a way that she Kamala Harris is already starting to do."
"I am Brandon Finnegan, co-founder of Decision Desk HQ."
Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote to Donald Trump 48%.
And that area of the country is also very much supportive of abortion rights.
"As we talked about on Friday, when we were doing scenarios, it all comes down to electoral math."
"I don't exactly know what the issue was there, but still looking at the big picture when it comes down to it, Trump is leading in Pennsylvania."
I'm hearing different facts.
And I heard Clay talking in the lead in about it being just indicative of her campaign not being ready for prime time.
Don't believe it.
CBS News political correspondent Caitlin Dewey Burns joins us now.
"But one thing is for sure, Pennsylvania is shaping up to be one of the most critical battlegrounds in the 2024 election."
"There's a very high-stakes Senate race playing out in Arizona this cycle, too."
Colorado is not the state she will be exception making from.
And the inspirational quote on the back.
"Sex, drugs, and rock and roll, right?"
One of the stories that you wrote had to do with an interesting quirk in Pennsylvania's impact on the Electoral College.
Trump's message appears to be resonating with suburban voters in particular.
"Trump is also making a concerted effort to appeal to veterans, promising better health care and support for those who have served."
And she's used it to grant amnesty to millions upon millions of people who have no legal right to be in the country.

"I mean, you look, you can have the opinion of rich folks and that's fine, but we all know how people that got money, we know like a lot of your white liberals, we got money."
The Democrats big pitch has been nowadays about women's rights so-called women's rights and abortion access What do you make of that pitch to woman?
You were the person who administered the votes in Maricopa County before you became the Secretary of State.
"This narrow margin reflects a competitive race, with Trump staying within striking distance, showcasing his resilience and ability to maintain strong support in Pennsylvania."
And every little bit can help Harris get over the top and win the all-important state.
I think that's her goal tonight.
The new poll today from the New York Times hasn't been added in to the Wisconsin average.
You need Pennsylvania to win ideally.
She brings joy to this.
"But without further ado, let's go ahead and roll it."
But she's also playing on his side of the field.
These guys don't get any.
And we're going to do everything we can to make sure we ensure a win here in Pennsylvania for the Harris-Wallace ticket.
Remember how close that was last time.
"Somebody who was raised in the middle class, believes in the values that built this country, worked her way through college in McDonald's, served with distinction in every office she has ever held, who is as prepared for the job as any nominee for President has ever been."
"So first off, he says, they say I'm rambling, but I don't ramble."
It has been critical in recent years.
They come in and they take over.
Could you imagine after 40 hours you get time and a half and no tax on that time and a half money?
"Now, can he?"
Ruben's the kind of person we need in Washington.
"The only person who could control the weather is Beyonce, OK?"
We've talked about how important that voting bloc is.
These are the things we stand for and these therefore are the things we fight for.
Let's go ahead and take a listen to this.
"We'll be writing something later this week to kind of have them, they can email those friends."
"All right, Perry Russum there in D.C. Jay O'Brien in Chicago."
Let's move them.
"If they found a 40 point shift with these voters, which we know it's it's basically old Catholics that are taking this poll more than likely."
It's always good when you remember it's a commonwealth.
" In the final weeks leading up to election day, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are making their final pitches to voters."

"He is pulling the best in Pennsylvania of the three Rust Belt states, just like he did back in 2020."
He wants a political issue to run against me.

Did George Bush have a heart for the common man?
You know what would actually help bring order to the border and actually help fix our immigration system?
"You're the former head of the Freedom Caucus, Republican who's who's held a seat there for more than a decade."
How long did it take for people in the crowd to realize what was happening?
You're totally right.
I'm just trying to make the point that there are a whole lot of folks on the side of Harrison walls who have the ability to go out and bring different people into the conversation and be out there stumping for her when she's not able to be there.
Other farms in the area have declared bankruptcy or sold off property and downsized.
"So for me to do anything, I need Republican votes and Democratic votes."
I think she's doing it in a lot of reasons because the race is that close.
We didn't yield.
"That's why I am committed to passing a green new deal, creating clean jobs and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all."
"Oh, he's horrifically, wonderfully honest."
He did a rally yesterday.
That's another way of saying that's a lie.
Two generations definitely worth watching.
Is this like your annual checkup?
 Tomorrow is a huge day for the Kamala Harris campaign.
Let's dive deep into the evolving dynamics of these critical states.
It would be in line even with where near closer to where Obama got in 2012 than it would be to Joe Biden's 2020 numbers.
It looks like Trump's in a very good position to win the state.
"But there's got to be, there's got to be culture built by us that can still be creative, can still espouse values of freedom without encouraging kids to do drugs or be worse versions of themselves."
Thank you for everything that you did.
You wouldn't be OK. No.
"So if you get you know, you win early votes, but not by 70 points that it's only like 1.8 million votes or whatever."
"Well, Donald Trump and the debate coming up this week."
"Please don't let the person who did it be a person of color, please don't let the person that did it be a person of color, please don't let the person that did it be a person of color, please."
But you can see it was Republicans plus three.
The signs point toward that.
But this election will be decided in the key battleground states where the race is also essentially tied.
Put down your vote and do what?
"Well, that's just too early."
He is.
"Anthony, thanks for joining us today."

"Okay, for those of you just joining in Butler, Pennsylvania at a rally of about 50,000 patriotic Trump loving Americans gathered together on a Saturday to hear about the president's agenda."
"They really shot Trump and they missed, failed."
So it's totally legal.
"All we can say is he jumped back up, raised his fist in the air."
I think trump is gonna win the election.
Now they're running ads against Jill Stein in Michigan.
"Like anyone paying close attention to politics should have, including, and especially the Trump campaign."
"Well, the polling in the swing states really is what's important."
"So immediately brought together our communications team to begin through social media platforms, assuring the rest of the world whose eyes were on Pennsylvania that our vote counting was going to continue."
So what had happened was they couldn't count the votes until election day.
To see Trump would fill you with joy.
Kamala Harris has been getting out there doing a lot of interviews.
"I want to see where people are voting, what the trends are."
And so that is an issue right there for that poll.
That's what I was alluding to earlier.
"The last time an attempt even got close enough to harming the president was 1981, Ronald Reagan."
"But what's also like things that we have seen is the new 538 forecast, and I did want to touch base on this as well because this is 538, and Donald Trump is up in the polls in every single swing state."
It's that way in Virginia.

"I mean that we're, we're overtaxed."
"Trump flipped the state for the first time in 24 years, and then in 2020, Biden flipped it back, but just by around one percentage point."
We've been talking about this for a decade and hasn't changed it.
"President Biden had proposed raising the capital gains, long term capital gains rate on the top tax bracket all the way up to about 40 percent."
She's answering questions.
"And yesterday, the campaign is also wooing the voters in Pennsylvania."
What would that mean?
But Kamala Harris is right on this.
And there is the sugar high is coming from the elites.
You and every Secretary of State think about these things.
B. Pritzker CBS Philadelphia reporter Dan Snyder joins us now from the newsroom to talk more about the contenders than good evening to you.
That's a what is that a seven-point shift from 2016 compared to the polling average.
Thank you very much I didn't have time to get to it But the Biden administration today announced it would be finalizing proposal to force health insurance companies to cover Mental health care the same way they cover physical health conditions.

He has not put forth an economic agenda.

"But, you know, voters are safe, 30% in that poll."
"I really believe that she should hold tight and true to the strong part of the Democrats message, which is that we have we have a border bill that we presented to this president who Johnson and he vetoed."

I shared this with our vice president during her 2022 visit and it was so great hearing the passion and concern in her voice speaking on how diligently she and the administration is working to make sure that all households achieve the goal of having access to clean drinking water and lead-free paint.

That's not what we're talking about We're talking about the open change talking about the excitement and all that She's not an order or to her like like he was or is it's not even close.
I feel like I'm going crazy.
Can I have a hug?
The suburbs surrounding Philadelphia represent another critical electoral frontier.
"Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more."

"I have iPhone bootstraps, Venezuela 100 billion dead."
"And that's actually good news for Donald Trump's campaign, because it means this election is by no means over."
It was it was odd to say the least.
My race is tight because of two reasons.
And I'm so happy that we're in this country.
Reading restaurant owner Cesar Lopez also recalls Harris's trip but hasn't been swayed yet.
"Correct Major, this is actually going to be the vice president's 10th visit to Pennsylvania since becoming the presidential nominee."

I think it's working for Trump.
So we're going to we're going to retain them.
"Again, that doesn't mean Trump's going to for sure lose if he loses the state."
We have all that.
If Harris wins Pennsylvania more than likely she wins the presidency.

"Thank you, guys."
"Even even plus one plus one, and you know, there's evens 49s."
Let me go over to Twitter and let's see if we can look at some video together.
 All of you all welcome back to yet another political episode.
"So, yeah, let's talk a little bit more about the context here."
Back to our friends at the rundown.
You need to be screened to enter this area.
She is going to North Carolina for a handful of rallies on Thursday.
"When the decision was made to overturn Roe, his reaction was that that decision made him, quote, very, very happy, unquote."
Mitchell Research is another one.
He consistently led Biden by around 4-6 points in decision desk HQ and the Hill's top-line average.
"And here we are in a situation where once again, an argument needs to be made by men in order to reach men."
" So we saw with her own eyes, I think she did pretty well against him."
"And also, Brandon, the upcoming primary on Tuesday, how much of a difference does that make for voters in PA?"
My street was rock ribbed Republican.
People don't really feel that way.
"The idea that Trump is going to get 50% in any of the swing states that are not faux swing states like Texas or Florida, I guess are those faux swing states are not really swing states that we have the seven, right?"
"And that is a really good point, because I remember that from the last election."
And sometimes I didn't live up to those values and I made mistakes.
"Look, the Republican party has completely capitulated to Donald Trump, not just on issues, not just on policy, not just giving him the nomination three times for president, but even on something as important as this, if this had been Joe Biden, as you just suggested, they would be demanding that the 25th amendment be invoked right now today, this minute."
So the 46 to 43 lead here is also very much in line with what we see on Quinnipiac of a 48 versus 45 point lead and then a 50 to 46 lead for Kamala Harris in the New York Times poll.
And we have other polling out of other swing states.
 Check your six.
And it was an indication of where it was.
"I was sitting at home, come down a golden escalator."
So that is the hero right now of our country.
"But again, Trump can win the election without Pennsylvania."
"Specifically, we're looking at Kamala Harris's chances, and one state that has everyone on edge, Pennsylvania."
"But I need to know right off the bat, I've been there so many times for politics, Wilkes-Barre, Wilkes-Barre or Wilkes-Barre."
"No, there's a good chance that these are just new voters that have registered to vote and they are becoming Republicans."
I get some water from the store or something like that.
Where are you from Charleroi?
 Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes are seen as critical for both the Trump and Harris campaigns.
Part of that was because they wanted Trump to be up so they could pressure Biden to drop out its political strategy.
"I like how a family of four can make $67,000 and that's a middle class."
"But I think we're going to unleash, with Trump as president for a second term, a golden age of prosperity for Arizona and the whole country."
"You can cut the check for Chinese American or Japanese American, excuse me, with the internment camps, you can cut the check for, you know, the small hats and what happened to them, which we had nothing to do with, but the American government can cut checks for that."
Is it possible Trump can win Wisconsin and win the election and lose Pennsylvania?
She tweeted.
They say you like to stick to your talking points.
None of it affected his trajectory.
"In 2020, Trump performed well with voters who showed up on election day, and he's hoping for a repeat performance this year."
What's your reaction?
Those leads are largely within the margin of error.
So the idea is that hopefully by the end of the day today about 7 p.m. local time or 9 p.m. Eastern time we should get hopefully the rest of the the information and the ballots through the tabulation system and know where it stands and the reason Maricopa County is so important Anne Marie is because there are so many votes that come from here.
So I think he needs to be replaced.
Concrete plans.
"It's like a constant, like down by three, three, three, four."
"People were waiting, including after the debate, thinking, well, at the debate, we'll get some specifics."
Remember we were small government not overreaching into your life or your life or your life.
Can he try to spend his way to being popular?
"You know, thanks over my career, we were lucky if we could, we don't get 37 and Philadelphia burbs in the four counties, we would be on track to winning, of course, that no longer is the case."
And I think that Trump's decision to pick Vance as his running mate signals that that's kind of where he wants the party to move.
I haven't asked a question yet.
Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote and Donald Trump 45%.
And so that's why I'm here.
Pennsylvania is particularly divided between different voter groups in different regions.
Voter registration doesn't matter either.
We're outside of Phoenix City Hall right here.
"Now, I know everyone's gonna say, but the RCP average is tied."
Let's look at this endorsement draft that Trump drafted up here talking about.
"I mean, I listened to some of the language that's being thrown around."
This is just the problem that we have.
"When I say rhino, I'm a Republican in any moment."
"Okay, here's the message."
"And I think he's going to gain with Hispanic significantly, especially among Puerto Ricans in the Philadelphia area, Philadelphia City proper in particular."
"On the other hand, Donald Trump only got slightly over 80% of the votes, about 460,000 votes."
So this is a pretty good number that we have here in Pennsylvania.
We know that people are struggling to put food on the table for their families.
"Now with less than a month from election day, what is it that's keeping these undecided voters from knowing for sure, yes, I'm going to vote for Harris or yes, I'm going to vote for Trump?"
I will link to everything in the box.
"At that point, he's winning states like Wisconsin, Michigan."
I don't want your opinion.
"Yeah, more than likely Trump is up in Pennsylvania right now."
It's about 48% to 47%.
"He's very unpopular in a lot of places around the country, but he's from Pennsylvania."
I am not concerned about today.
It's left Ohio.
What's your teacher's name?
"Next, in a twist that sounds straight out of a sci-fi movie, Russia's Ramzan Kadyrov has equipped a Tesla Cybertruck with a machine gun for the Russian-Ukraine war."
Sprint to the finish here in this state to be sure.
"I know hindsight is 2020, but looking back at it now, any idea what happened?"
And yet our government treated as though our current government is treating it as though we don't need this energy.
He also had a lot of time or a lot of fun seemingly to poke at her rehab image over the last couple of weeks since Joe Biden's dropped out.
Here's how to do it.
" Now, perhaps the single biggest lie that Harris told her in the debate on Tuesday, a little bit under the radar, it came toward the end of the night when she said, quote, I've made very clear my position on fracking."
Freeze the screen if you like.
It's a truncated schedule.
"These numbers suck for Democrats and even returns, which that's the copium Democrats are using, but the absentee returns."
"Mr. Wallace is gonna be fantastic too, so we're just over the moon."
They want those numbers to continue to come in.
"Kamala Harris is so at 191 electoral votes, filled in for the vice president, both with the solid and probable states currently."
So we got great news and also breaking news.
So we've seen what Trump is capable of and we've seen what life was like after a Trump administration.
"We are going to be talking about in this video, but it is important that we cover the fact that Donald Trump is pulled ahead in the state of Pennsylvania for the first time in a while that is with an outlier in there a Biden plus eight outlier."
They complain that they've been left out of events and surrogates haven't even been deployed effectively.
But they're into the cooking.
What is the feeling now about the best course of action?
And there has not been an armistice.
This guy was actually breaking down how this is so staged.
"However you look at it, the prospects don't look good, I think, to put it mildly, on voting rights with the filibuster or without the filibuster."
Any sense of where things stand in those counties?
And you are going to yet again make history as the first gentleman of the United States of America.
"That is I mean, he was in the way back machine there."
We'll see if it goes anywhere.
"Still, 49-49, it's a nail biter here, and it's not quite clear what's happening."
Whoopi.
"I don't think she's very likely to endorse Biden, but it's possible she never endorsed his Trump."
So we're doing a lot.
"Now you're hearing them say that, Oh, they lost so many jobs."
"My question to you is, what's your stance on reparations?"
"I do a TV show that is called Front Porch Politics and it really focuses on the people, everyday people in communities, not candidates or institutions like congress and state legislatures."
I have to address this.
"I mean, for a long time, a lot of political reporters and myself included, analysts and such, were saying that, you know, women running away from Trump, it's really going to help Harris."
What are they saying?
Thank you for your service.
"And some of these polls that we see with these cross tabs, but still, it's a little bit besides the point."
"One Democrat said, I feel like we're gonna win here, but we're gonna win in spite of Harris's campaign."
You're happy.
"One, he's going to come out to many men by 50 Cent at his next campaign rally, whether or not 50 Cent clears it."
He's always been a supporter of the channel And you know what's so wild is he left a lot of comments in the yt system with flagging a man.
"Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro told us that choosing Al Schmidt, a lifelong Republican, as his first Cabinet pick last year, was intended to send a clear message."
Ignoring that problem is not making it go away.
"Matt Gorman, Caitlin Huey Burns."
"With just 25 days left until election day, a Reuters Ipsos poll shows Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in the suburbs for the first time."
OK. Yeah.
And I think that's what Josh Shapiro and I have been doing.
You're talking about nonpartisan pollsters here.
"If you have any doubt how important the youth vote is to both campaigns, just rewind the Republican and Democratic National Conventions this past summer."
I think Eastern Pennsylvania.
but you really need to If you look for truth You have to find for it not by just hearing it To follow up on that many people in the media call Trump racist Have you heard this stuff and do you believe any of that?
"So we have something of a general consensus here hovering around zero with a few outliers to deal with, starting with the two massive swings in favor of Trump, Franklin and Marshall and Susquehanna."
We are all part of the divine nine.
It's a challenge.
"If you want electric, great."
I have no clue.
"And if so, why is it that way?"
"By the end of it, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, the chair of the Oversight Committee, who's presiding while Mr. Gosar gets to explain himself here."
 Well today former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are back on the campaign trail Trump will hold a press conference in Los Angeles County this afternoon before heading to Las Vegas for a rally this evening Harris is back in Pennsylvania today stopping first in Johnstown before holding a rally later this evening in Wilkes-Barre We have team coverage this morning with CBS News campaign reporters Zach Hudak and Olivia Rinaldi I want to start with Zach who is covering the Harris campaign for us from Washington So Zach Harris's event in Pennsylvania tonight.

"The group claims to have about 700,000 people who support it."

"Oh, right."
Kamala Harris sucks.
"And if we just get back to common sense leadership, we can have safe neighborhoods, a secure border, and an American life that is affordable for the majority of our citizens."
Did this debate change your mind in any way?
The only reason he didn't get a lot more done is because they gave him grief every minute of every day.
"In 2020, they narrowly got by, and in some races, it really didn't work out the way that they thought it was going to be."
"And instead of giving more tax cuts to billionaires and people who don't need them, and raising prices on working families, Kamala is going to give a tax cut to 100 million middle-class and working people here in America."
"The anticipated lag, which dragged out Pennsylvania's count in 2020, now has election officials bracing for a repeat of conspiracy theories and violence."
I'm the only governor in the whole country with a divided legislature.
"Peter Henline, a lifelong Republican says the GOP is screwed."
"On the flip side, Trump has a 92.4% chance of winning the election if he flips Pennsylvania back to red."
Let's see if we can make it a reality.
If you want to vote for Biden and think that's going to be effective then go ahead.
Spread the word.
"When asked for comment, the Trump campaign did not address Loomer simply saying his participation in the 9-11 ceremony was not about anyone other than the souls who are no longer with us."
"It does tilt her way here though on our latest polling map, joining Wisconsin, which does lift Kamala Harris up to 244 electoral votes now as Trump continues to lag behind at 228."
The Bronx is the most democratic and still drawing a big crowd.
Where are the other people that started screaming about Charleroi?
Most likely he's not going to only lose non-college whites by eight points.
It's not even believable.
We have to win Pennsylvania.
We just don't know.
Voters continue to say that they want to know more about Kamala Harris's policy positions.
I'll give you a little secret.
"So Trump knows that if he wins here, he's on a really good path to maybe winning."

It gives him added attention.

There was no bill.
It's OK with me.
So they get more runway.
"Practically every recent poll here, besides Harvard Harris and Russ Musken, show Kamala Harris leading."
"I mean, you mentioned Marist, their tide poll from the Hill, and Emerson, that was done between September 15th and September 18th."
"McClelland also said she has not spoken with Street since the controversy over her post, but believes their relationship will be fine."

"Once COVID was over, it was like building up in me during the period of lockdown and then once it ended, I was ready to go out there and make a difference."

And that's with 80 days to go.

"They are so bad and frankly, they're evil."
"This issue is particularly sensitive for Pennsylvania's voters, and Harris's ability to defend her position could be a turning point in the election."
That's the day I left office.
"And they'll even take it from a phony buffoon, you know, blowhard, like Trump, who's not strong, but he pretends to be strong, so they even go with that."
You know we win Pennsylvania.
Go and vote.
And so I think the grace that has to be awarded to this community and this point of time is that this issue is as has to be as prioritized as those that I spoke to domestically.
So this is significant because we have a key Senate race there.
"Kamala Harris received 48% of the vote and Donald Trump, 51%."
"If Joe Biden was leading the polls in every single swing state, some swing states that, you know, Democrats didn't even win last time, and he was up by, let's say, five points in some of them, there's no universe that Trump would even be a 20% favorite, yet they make Biden the outright favorite even if it is by a narrow margin."
We'll do that for you for the White House.

"He has battled Trump directly, which fits with Harris's campaign message, painting Trump as a fella."
"She could very well not only be the Republican nominee, Nicole, but we're looking at a strong reality that she could be the next governor of Arizona."
"So what are you seeing, thinking and feeling about the Republicans' ground game?"
"President Trump, in his tenure in the White House, was a lot more affordable, and the American dream was in reach for our generation."
"Nearly 61,000 people have registered to vote in North Carolina since Biden stepped out of the race."
And so the audit is supposed to be back on.
And I'd rather be Kamala Harris.
We won't have official results until we have official results.
"But we're going to usher in a new golden age of American success for the citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed."
"That's why I believe that these voters, they're going to shift heavily towards Trump or they just may not vote."
"We need law and order and we need legal immigration, which President Trump has always been a proponent of."
"In a related context, Donald Trump, during an interview with Musk, reiterated his belief that the Ukraine invasion would not have occurred under his presidency, while simultaneously calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky honorable despite past controversies."
"And so, so anyway, I think it's a, it's a plus both politically, you know, and for the broader ideological project."
It looks like somebody missed they shot and maybe grazed them and let me tell you what's gonna happen over the next couple days.
And look at that deal.
"And I can say talking to voters at these rallies, that is something that comes up time and time again as the top issue of concern."
Seven hundred thousand voters right now.
Hopefully that doesn't bother you too much.
They've gained significantly from 2020.
She was.
The current national polling on real clear politics is Harris plus two point two.
So it was standard in a few ways.
"But if you're Harris, these are bad numbers for her."
We'll call them NPR Republicans.
Bye-bye.
He's been forgetting things.
Where's Gina?
"And it should also be pointed out that we've been covering a lot of voting changes that have been implemented in the states after 2020, a lot of Republican attempts to change the voting laws in light of 2020."
"But no, they don't care because they're trying to even not talk about the gas powered car bands and the EVs."
Let's put it that way.
"With 312 electoral votes, Donald Trump readily secured reelection by his highest margin yet, Kamala Harris at just 226, the worst Democratic performance since 1988."
That's what's really accounting for this surge.
I think we killed it.
I want to fire workers for trying to organize a union.
"The only thing is only caveat is I hope it doesn't end up being correct because Trump is a stronger pollster, a stronger candidate."
Thank you so much for sticking with us.
You're play this clip.
"Now, ever since she started this back in 2020, when she ran for president the first time, if you guys didn't know, yes, she has already run for president and it didn't go well at all."
I got you sir.
"If somebody knows that you have a gun in your house, they say, let's go after somebody else."
So why aren't they utilizing her more?
Thank you so much for joining me today.
"Of the electorate in the midterms, but this is a presidential year."
We just don't know but Pennsylvania is a crucial state for Donald Trump and he never led in Pennsylvania back in 2020.
"It's drill, baby, drill."
Kamala Harris received 49 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 46 percent.
"But as I mentioned, it's about 44% of the Democratic electorate."
But I don't know what happened to him.
And it's all total gaslighting because originally Trump opened up everything too soon.
"I mean, I thought Democrats, we were the party that was all about second chances and that we're not going to condemn somebody based on mistakes or things in that kind of situation."
"In the past two elections, it supported Trump with quite similar numbers."
They're inner reflections and you try and paint those realms.
"Get the new exclusive teas, mugs and stickers right now at store.mitastouch.com."
Just a quick update.
"And the article does mention that some Democrats are feeling more hopeful with her on board, but it's still a big challenge."
Your prediction was a bit off.
There's going to be more day of voting for the Democrats.
"So why should everyday Americans care about what you do and what frackers do, even if they're not a part of the industry?"
The building trades president Sean McGarvey told Dovery that Biden quote is almost like the perfect leader sent at the perfect time for working people.
But what I've seen over the last four or five weeks with Kamala Harris is just extraordinary energy.
People are calling it bizarre this morning.
The decision to uphold mail-in ballot requirements can be framed as a measure to prevent fraud and protect the integrity of the election.
"So I mean, and she does the exact same thing in this and making life more affordable for people."
His legacy is failure.
It's definitely helped the financial benefits as far as the community continues to do well because they're getting royalties off of the gas wells.
That just seems so unlikely that it's just not going to happen.
"There was actually a strong focus from the Hillary Clinton campaign on Pennsylvania, and yet she lost the state by roughly the same margin that she lost Wisconsin by, even though she had not visited Wisconsin just once, not even once, after the convention in 2016."
And there are counties around Allegheny County that Trump carried.
Harris is not really gaining a lot from 2020 and there's a lot of room that she apparently would have to grow.
"I mean, he is out there, he's given two, two and a half hour speeches, just word salads."
And I think I'll leave that right there for now.
"Yes, he is running for Arizona Secretary of State, where he would be in charge of the state's elections."
"So when she stands before the American people and says, on day one, we're going to tackle the affordability crisis, or on day one, we're going to secure that southern border, our response to Kamala Harris needs to be, day one was 1,400 days ago, Kamala."
Kamala Harris is a seasoned politician with a deep understanding of the complex issues facing the nation today.
I'm very excited for 2028.
And it seems odd that like there hasn't been much credit for that assigned to her.
"But, as with any election, early voting isn't the final word."
But it's a tough thing to do.
"Two days ago at Washington's Cross in Parks County, my hometown, we had endorsements from Republicans, Republican Governor Chris Whitman."
"Yeah, maybe there could be something to that."
Let's see if we increase.
But I think that the Democratic Party needs to align together under one common cause.
I'm standing in a parking lot in Baltimore where just last week the so-called Blacks for Trump bus appeared hoping to change hearts and minds in a very blue state.
I gotta go ahead and chant.
"I said, look, you are asking me to do something that is counter to my oath when I swore to the Constitution to uphold it, and I also swore to the Constitution and the laws of the state of Arizona."
So showing Harris up by 6 percentage points in Georgia while showing Trump up by 6 percentage points in Arizona.
"The New York Post reporting that Democrats in Pennsylvania, that all-important state, say that Harris is, quote, AWOL in being out message."
"And so it'll encourage more donations, more enthusiasm, more volunteers, more energy, because it shows the tightening of the race."
And they are shitty pollsters like Bloomberg.
"That $3 per gallon more means upwards of $800 to $1,200 a week in fuel expense and less to meet our business and family's needs."
"Thanks to the bold, visionary leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris and our colleagues in Congress, who are doing a great job for you, by the way."
Sorry.
And look at the trend every single day since requests started.
"If Harris wins Pennsylvania, her path to the White House becomes much clearer."
Donald Trump has managed to bounce back in the last two weeks.
We're not going to see these crazy swings like where Trump almost won the electoral college while losing the popular vote by four points.
She's a communist.
These are the only points that can be won.
And today we got to talk about president Donald Trump working a shift at a Pennsylvania McDonald's.
Cause Jill Stein is stealing the Muslim vote.
"People are making six figures working in this industry, and they pump that money back into the economy."
"And she started going on a rant and he said, man, man, hold on a second."
He's just not right.
We are at the cusp of a regional war unfolding across the entire Middle East.
A lot of it is tied to policy preferences.
This is a renaissance painting.
"And she is stopping by not only Luzerne County, but Cambria County earlier today."
Yep.
And here's the weirdest part.
He then calls Vice President Kamala Harris a new fighter.
"Yeah, I'd support her over the other candidates in the race."
He's up big in the polls in Nevada as well and Wisconsin seems like that first domino to fall in the rust belt.
"To first poll, conducted by BSG."
"To me, the worst is the border, because it's like what they're doing is they're destroying our country."
Thanks for having me.
Dylan Smith joins me now from Arizona.
We encourage our audience to engage with the electoral process actively.
But still Chester County close to maxed out Montgomery County in Delaware.
"It's using all of the voter data that comes in through the Pennsylvania Secretary of State, puts it into a nice website."
"1992, they've originally been voted together."
Be yourself.
And I think the election may help people come to terms with what's the better solution for the future of the Republican Party.
"Not just because of that, but because also she's just a nice person."
I feel like we should be able to.
"But I think that there are, for a lot of people, they say, well, they said all this in 2016 about him, how he's going to be dangerous and all that kind of stuff."
"Atlas Intel showing a tie, even though they're not really partisan."
And they're running out of time.
"The state has seen an influx of new residents, particularly from other states, which has altered the political landscape."
"And this just goes to show you, this is another scenario, just like the SAVE Act."
So what Donald Trump has proposed doing is we're going to stop doing mass parole.
I brought about automatic voter registration in Pennsylvania.
"And now people were like, yeah, okay."
So they hold the key to the U.S. selections of who the next president would be in these swing states.
And you get all these exclusive articles as well.
He's a nearly 80 year old man.
"The chair, the Republican chair of the county board of supervisors, responded to this briefing on the Arizona clown show audit today with this."
"Yada, yada, yada."
But Trump is polling better in Pennsylvania than he is in Michigan.
Parnell was the best candidate for the race.
And people should know that this this climate insanity from Dome is it's not a one off.
And this is why I hedged on the original question.
"But you go a little bit further out, you know, maybe even your more rural areas of Gwinnett County."
"So anyway, just play it."
It's 2.1 million ballots.
She's gone to the border for years.
"If you want to sign up for the website, it is 16 cents a day."
"Andrapal, thank you for your inputs."
What more do you need to hear from her to get you there?
"That's not good news, but the more important takeaway is the battleground states because they pulled voters from battleground states and what did they exactly find?"
What's the feeling he gives you?
Where did it come from me?
"Donald Trump doing so much better in terms of voter registration, early voting, all of the counties compared to what's going on with the Democrats to where they're literally signing artillery shells in a factory in Pennsylvania that are being used to escalate or potential World War three scenario."
"The point is, I was just picturing it, the point is if you elect Kamala, they will not be focused on their problems, they will be focused on yours."
"Look, I want to see Kamala Harris deliver her vision for a future for all Americans, particularly for young Americans."
"In fact, many of the candidates Trump has endorsed shouted from the rooftops, all looking to grab the MAGA vote."
And our magnificent American liberty is your God-given right.
"But still, Biden was able to stop the bleeding."
"Final question, if this election were to be held tomorrow, where would you be putting your money?"
"They don't, like I say, they don't want a felon to get back in there because we know he caused a insurrection and they're scared of a woman."
 Did you like my mugshot?
"But if you look at battleground states, where electoral votes are decided, it looks like Harris has a lead in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and even in Michigan."
The former president expected to begin speaking at 5 p.m. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff also visiting Tucson to represent the Harris campaign at an event.
"And despite all of the damage that Kamala has inflicted on the state and, you know, don't forget, she's the vice president."
"To be honest with you, I understand that politics get a lot of people enraged, but I don't think anybody deserves to lose their life at all, right?"
We want to build more right here in the United States of America.
It says independent presidential candidate Cornell West lost the legal challenge Friday in his bid to get on the ballot in the ballot ground battleground state of Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court judge Renee Cone Jubileerer in a 15 page opinion sided with the Secretary of State's office under Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro in rejecting West candidacy paperwork The Secretary of State's office said West campaign lacked or card affidavits for 14 of the West 19 presidential electors So what I think is kind of going on to I don't know if that's the case here But what it looks like is I guess a lot of the states required maybe in addition to signatures also these electors who are Promising to vote for you But what ended up happening in the state of Arizona?
We will continue to have updates hopefully every night like this.
"You talk about, you know, the Democratic governor, the Democratic mayor and, you know, Kate Gallego."
"As we look toward November, your state, Pennsylvania, has become the closest polling state of all of the blue wall state."
The Harris-Waltz campaign has a full schedule this week in multiple battleground states.
"And this crowd, it looks like it's going to continue out here growing right now."
Do you think the vice president did enough tonight to convince voters in your state that she won't ban fracking?
I don't think there was one poll back in 2016.
You had to go through a secret service protected detail to get into this site and people were arriving here as early as 10 or 11 this morning.
So Kamala is trying to take his place.
Two thieves came and smashed in the glass of the front doors of the library.
"So now in this the home stretch, the final three weeks, when something does come out about a new plan for this group or a new plan for that group, it doesn't resonate because people don't believe it."
And you could argue that's the reason he won Pennsylvania.
They're going to hold out as long as they can.
"That was a different time because it was the first time, like something like this had happened."
Weeks after the assassination attempt President Biden decided not to run for reelection and so as a result Trump now faces Vice President Kamala Harris.
Recently the poll in Nebraska's second congressional district shows him up there.
"They can, the polls can be wrong by seven points."
"So that's something that is of concern to the automotive industry here in Michigan, which of course is the economic driver of prosperity here in Michigan with thousands and thousands of jobs."
"Take a look in Georgia, where Trump is actually under an ongoing criminal investigation."
"And let's talk about the former president in the week ahead, because the RNC is going to kick off in Milwaukee on Monday."
"The way that they raise it, the fact that they did the audit is what helped foment these questions and people."
"Here's your semi-annual reminder to subscribe to your local paper, because among the observers today was a reporter from the Arizona Republic named Jen Fifield."

But she has a plan to address those challenges.
I think I would like to see more ads that actually talk about policies and issues.
Because they said that Donald Trump opened things up too quickly and he killed people because of it.
"So I have to get y else you want to say to t are on the fence that ar on CNN and mainstream mea So when you hear he's a r know all the bad things, and you'll find out the t you so excited?"
And what's the president doing?
"And let's face it, we're probably looking at a whole bunch of close races this time around, too, especially in those swing states."
Donald Trump is in the lead in Pennsylvania.
"So obviously, the candidates think it's an important issue."
"The stakes of this election with the statement being made by Donald Trump, I felt like I had to be here."
"We've seen things declassified and stuff like that over the years in the cia, right?"
"This weekend, we heard some of his most alarming rhetoric yet framing his political opponents as criminals and enemies."
"I mean, like you could argue it could go to Harris fine, but a Harris plus five poll is not it's not feasible right now."
It's not one of the giveaways that Kamala Harris is promising or for that matter some of the pandering that Donald Trump has done.
"And that's kind of what uh, obama is saying And before we close it out too."
"His name is going to be on there, embossed, right next to Luke."
"Although the child tax credit, the fact that that even JD Vance is disingenuously saying he's he'll do five thousand dollars."
The only place I go is McDonald's.
"And, and, and so I think it shows how they recognize the significance of that demo."
"I see shades of the Hillary Clinton campaign with the arrogance of a Democratic Party, out of touch with the electorate."
Everybody's going to know.

"Security is increased, but do you also anticipate that there's going to be any changes for the location of the stage?"
"Every kid, no matter your zip code, is given that foundation so that they have the freedom to chart their own course and the opportunity to succeed."
"And these are just safe states and also, maybe because of Philadelphia, because there's so many votes."
"So I want to, I'm doing this because Pennsylvania being the swing state and a must-win state for either candidate this time, I want to show you why you're going to have a lot of indigestion throughout the night on election night and why it's always really late in the evening before they can call the state of Pennsylvania and I'll show you why."
So yeah Kamala is angry at the Pennsylvania state and local officials.
"It's a different context though than Trump in 2020, 2019."
How much do you think that matters to undecided voters?
"Well, you'll forget more than I know, but those those four suburbs turn out more votes than Pittsburgh and Philadelphia combined."
"So Bill Belichick's books will be something like, Eat, Pray, Grunk."
"They're all going to show up on Election Day despite every study showing, uh, no, these people are going to vote early and that's it."
They're flooding the water levels or big lead.
"You know, putting Trump at 40 percent with the Spanish is kind of being a little bit generous to Kamala Harris, if anything, when you look at that."
You're working with different dynamics here that could give Trump a little bit of a boost as well.
But it's like you have all these other people.
So she's reached a sort of standstill in the aggregate.
You got state legislative races.
Trump's.
You can't kill me.
This is why it's a big deal to win Pennsylvania.
And so we're going to continue to monitor it.
"That you'd hear candidates saying, we're gonna de-register every voter and everyone has to re-register."
"It was very high, very steep."
In my opinion?
"Lies about everything, play the clip."
Six electors.
He says things that are off the cuff.
JD has been great.
"And again, we asked it retrospectively."
A sample size large enough.
Pennsylvania in particular will be under the microscope as results start to come in.
"There is a community of people who recognize that, that you don't just have to pull the lever for Donald Trump because you've done so in the past and that there are other people out there who recognize the importance of electing Kamala Harris, even despite longstanding party identity."
"The air we're breathing with the geoengineering and the chemtrails, if you want to call it the conspiracy theory version."
"My goodness, thank God he did fail on January 6th."
We're going to watch and see if anybody talks about it tonight.
I can guarantee you that Kerry Lake's not losing the state by six or seven.
"Oh my gosh, they got the military in there."
That's a fact.
So if you've got questions about this holler at me too.
"If you deport to these people, who would do that job and what price would we pay for food?"
Our Scott McFarland is there.
"In 2024, both candidates place high hopes on this group who are concerned with issues like the economy, jobs and public health."
"Despite his tangents and impressions of foreign leaders, Trump assured his supporters of his intelligence and focus."
Grab your friends and family and vote.
"She's taking shots at her own, trying to draw the attention back to that."
"However, recent events have forced the Democrats to lose out on some of their voter base."

"Moving forward to the fourth poll, also conducted by Emerson College on the same dates with a different 1,000 likely voters, Harris received 47% of the vote, while Trump received 47%."
Having a childcare tax credit.
She's the one that's caused all of this.
And I know we're going to work our tails off to ensure that we elect this ticket in November and that we flip Pennsylvania blue.
Every night blue flames would shoot out of that and you would hear the clanging and the banging and it was always like a shh shh shh shh that never stopped.
"I think she's done that talking about investments in climate change, reducing fossil fuel emissions and investments across the board in our generation concerning student loans and housing affordability as well."
Both candidates are holding dueling events in opposite ends of Pennsylvania today.
But this takes it to another level using it on political enemies.
It was all him.
And I feel very good about the economic situation the country is in right now.
"I'm like, how much more can you screw up?"
"Obviously, a bunch of ancestral Democrats, they became Republicans."
"However, Harris does better on issues such as like abortion, or issues of, you know, integrity or character."
You've got to uncross those fingers.
"Even if that guy has a better overall plan for you, which make your life better."
I've never ever ever ever ever been asked for any Politician could you get tickets to go and see them?
The public representation of him as an old man succeeded and the Democrats removed him in a right way.
"This is so bad that if Donald Trump would have taken Democrats' advice, and I'm sure most of us realize that he's using the whole COVID thing as a way to say Donald Trump's a terrible president because when he left office, of course COVID was raging and you had all his, his economy got destroyed because of it."
They just see people.
But you're asking me to do something against my oath and I will not break my oath.
She's a good worker.
She's backing Trump.
"Right now we have 16 million jobs added, 16 million jobs added."
I've been skating for decades.
"They were like, I don't know about that because skateboards don't sell that much."
"They're both different goals, but they can both achieve their goals in one debate."
"And that's how you frame it, Bob."
They're going to continue to fight price gouging and these junk fees that the Biden-Harris administration has been taking dead aim at.
 been one of the most disturbing aspects of this election season about Trump's rise in politics is how we seem to have set aside the values that people like Dan stood for and Bob stood for and that I was taught and those didn't used to be Republican Democratic values.
Which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down when what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.
"President Biden said, you see the photos right there."
"It's closing rapidly in Pennsylvania, where early voting numbers favor Democrats."
"And at the same time, I'm worried about Iran's response, whether that could be today."
A riot.
"He had 60 for I mean, it was a shorter period time than people think it was like closer to like, you know, 14 months, maybe because Franken didn't get seated until around this time after the election."
"But when you look at the average overall, you see that nationally Harris leads by 2 percentage points."
Their oversampling did show that Donald Trump's in a position to win a considerable share of the black vote compared to previous Republican candidates but also that's at the trade-off of losing and losing ground with white voters.
None of this is a surprise.
"This time we have a total of 7 to look at including Franklin and Marshall, Quinnipiac, The Hill Emerson, NYT Siena, Rasmussen, Mullenburg, College and Susquehanna."
"Okay, Detroit."
And they say he probably won't pay again.

"In contrast, Harris and the Democrats have advocated for a transition to renewable energy, which has been met with some resistance from voters who fear job losses in the energy sector."
"But in terms of the electorate, it is true that we just have to keep breaking it down using the swingometer."
We're getting stuff right now out of Pennsylvania.
Let's play this one interaction and get your take on the other side.
The rallies are the biggest we've ever had by far.
"Also in Arizona, I know we've been talking about the presidential race, but they have a really key Senate race there between Ruben Gallego, who's a current congressman, and Kerry Lake, the Republican."
"They're already at 330,000 while Democrats they're still 200,000 votes shy from their total in 2022."
"Well, I think the real question is, is how come the Democrats are spending so much time and money here?"
But here's the story.
Think about that and understand what it means.
This poll is within the margin of error.
"So it's very, very expensive."
"Now, there may be a reason for that."
"And it shows why getting people engaged, especially those who haven't felt heard or represented is so important."
That whole city was dead.
"To begin with, Pennsylvania epitomizes the broader national divide that exists between urban and rural voters."
"Well, it was a fierce debate."
"When she unveiled her running mate, she went to Philly."
And some media says you have... That would be called discipline.
And I think they're the best.
"Because sometimes, and this has been an interesting learning experience for me, is you assume that a particular tribe is going to come out one way on an issue, and then you sit down and talk to them."
Just let me know in the comments down below.
"I mean, we all know that Kamala Harris is like, like, so left."
"Kaylee, just, Deakin's making a very good point here because Kamala Harris did come out in 2019 for these EV mandates."
We've had a historic pandemic that wreaked havoc on communities and businesses.
And now continues doing so.

You'll be back next hour to break down more of it for us.
"Look, we'll see."
"If it wouldn't work for you, why should it work for the President of the United States?"
The polls in Pennsylvania across the board seem to be in flux.
"I mean, he is someone who really seems to not have any kind of vision for the future and is just focused on sort of the silliness of the past, settling old scores and a whole bunch of wacky conspiracy theories."
And that's what it's looking like right now.
And I think my message to folks who are undecided is very simple.
But so I would personally keep that in mind.
"The seventh poll was conducted between September 20th and 24 by Beacon Research, Shaw and Company Research among 1,021 registered voters."
"He's got deep, deep roots in the Pennsylvania community."
Then Donald Trump has a proven track record of ripping away people's rights and freedoms and a blueprint in this project 2025 for how to limit people's freedoms even more going forward.
Stay ahead of the curve.
You're not winning Pennsylvania as of now and your pathway to winning is all but gone.
"A second Democrat elected official in the state described Liu as AWOL, wow."
"The Republican nominee for president has repeatedly attacked Haitians this week, lying about them eating pets."
Very popular in the area was up by 30 points just say a month ago.
Ruben is the kind of person we need in Washington.
Michael Ruhle did alright.
"Now is the time for every American who loves our country to step back from the division, renounce all violence and unite in prayer for President Trump and his family."
"It's not just ancestral Democrats, because this means these are actually new voters."
We will stop.
Hopefully.
Sources close to the campaign tell CBS News they're kind of pulling out all the stops as they prepare.
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 48% each.
Maybe we got a little bit more a few more suburban white women this time.
"They have an advisor playing the role of former President Trump during their mock debates, even dressing up as him."
"So I think it's gonna come down to the wire, come down to that, get out the vote and come down to the exhausting last few weeks of the campaign."
"Yeah, you are watching the first draft of history right here."
"They say, how could you ever say that there's any voter fraud?"
And then they say they added the record number of jobs.
"Maybe they're comparing it to 2016, but Hillary lost it in 2016 in Pennsylvania."
And here's here's something I'd like to talk about.
"Tim, you know, critics will will look at Liz Cheney going going on the campaign trail with Kamala and say and basically say, look, look, she didn't even have enough of a constituency to stay in the house."
What should we know about what we might expect from the results?
I can't afford to purchase a whole animal this year.
"That said, this is Pennsylvania and so many of these states, just like the country, so closely divided."
It obviously has come out since then that this was an orchestrated scheme.
I've witnessed it.
Our votes do really matter here and I think that's the message that we're trying to send and I think people have been receptive to that.
"By the way, also we have the America first design the Rep logo design all of our original designs plus the new designs."
You had a lot of the people in the DeSantis camp.
"And so putting people on the record, Judy, you're right, it in some ways keeps the focus on the intra-party fighting, which is, Democrats can't seem to get their act together."
"Thank you for your time, sir."
"But under the Joe Biden and Donald Trump matchup, on the day that Joe Biden dropped out of the race, the numbers looked far worse for the Democrats, with Donald Trump at the advantage point of 4.5% in terms of his lead over Joe Biden."
"That means that there are 300,000 hunters in Pennsylvania that are not registered."
So that's why Pennsylvania is so crucial.
And we understand the dynamic.
Are you registered to vote?
Actual plans.
"Because randomly, a woman pulled up into a parking lot in the back part of the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library."
"I remember reading that about, I don't know, a month ago."
"Actually, he can't afford to lose Wisconsin."
He was a brave man.
"Among these are Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, three states in the industrial Midwest that have been central to recent elections."
"Again, not true."
"So with only six days left in this campaign, there are serious, real open questions about the surging Kathy Barnett campaign and where she truly stands on issues."
Their polls in Pennsylvania in 2020 were amazing.
And a new CBS poll shows just how close the race is.
Right?
She said she was going to ban plastic straws.
Her experience as the daughter of immigrants has given her a unique and valuable perspective on the challenges and opportunities presented by immigration.
He then attacks President Biden for calling Pennsylvania a state.
And Donald Trump was heavily criticized by conducting diplomacy with Vladimir Putin and little rocket man in North Korea.
"Vice President Kamala Harris, a trailblazer in her own right, brings a wealth of experience to the political stage."
"Again, Trump's trying to show some solidarity with union workers."
"Especially after this Politico article we've got our hands on, let me tell you, it has some Pennsylvania Democrats seriously worried."
"I'm sorry, gentlemen."
"She volunteered to be an observer today of this Michigas, not necessarily because that's an appropriate way for the press to have to observe this thing."
But then we also ask this question here retrospectively.
"And so that's the phenomenon where the Republican party eventually says, we're losing our base."
And then you've also got this going on at the same time on the same day.
"But if they can't play basketball, they shouldn't be joining."
I thought she did give enough I like what she gave on military what she wants to do for our veterans and with border control I just think that she has a lot of good ideas and she's a very well-spoken.
But they don't always show up to vote.
And we're going to have our choice.
"Both Harris and Trump are preparing for a long night, with their teams ready to respond to the unfolding drama."
He's getting a lot of criticism for being too friendly with China.
"Former President Trump lost that in 2020 by over 25 percentage points, but he still got over 180,000 votes there."
People put signs that are this gun or we have some of them actually spell the kind of a gun they have.
They do not want to specifically talk about any of Trump's legal woes.
"And Democrats, if he were anybody who wasn't a centrist, there's a clip about Tim Wals outreach."
But I do think that you really have to look at these moderate Republican voters.
I think the economic issue is a sort of broad gut check.
"So as they talk to voters, they have one eye on this."
They're coming in and they're being put up in hotels on the taxpayers dime.
How surprising is it to see a Trump endorsed Oath Keeper candidate for elected office?
"So, it really is a flip-flopping county that historically was bluer, but has gotten much redder over time and is a place where manufacturing is very strong."
"I think the shy Trump voter was always kind of like a false way of explaining it, especially as pollsters nowadays typically don't poll by phone as much as they used to."
This idea of going forward.
"And that really speaks volumes, even though Donald Trump was getting outspent in the primary in a lot of places."
"Outregistered Democrats with new voters, not just Democrats becoming Republicans."
F of 52 equals 46.
"Patrick, just keep up all the good you do, Stephen."
Where these Bibles are made.
"Like, like, like that's, that's the thing."
Seven million viewers watched Kamala Harris on Fox News.
Kamala Harris was angry.
"If he loses Pennsylvania, he basically has to win Pennsylvania in order to come up with the victory here."
I know what what jumped out to you about it.
"How you doing, Danielle?"
I believe that he will win the election.
This is not some grand conspiracy.
"Obviously, it's gonna be a very close election, but everyone was claiming that Trump was secretly down by 15 points in Pennsylvania that he was gonna lose the election."
And he's admitting that Republicans are bullish and Harris is in trouble.
You can't take your eye off a big county like Bucks County or or even Delaware County in the southeast or Allegheny County in the west where you have the potential for big swings.
He's fighting for you.
I would do like a Ben Franklin clothes on each one.
They actually have a good reputation as far as being church-going and being hard-working.
"President on the ground bleeding from the back of his head, his ear, it looks like."
"So that's Pennsylvania, that's the poll itself."
"The Democrats in a risky move even running TV ads, highlighting Gibbs' ties to Trump."
The border is wide open.
"So, you know, get in the fight with us, get in the trenches with us, you know, bank your vote."
These investments present a historic opportunity to change the game for so many communities struggling to access clean water across the country and I'm proud to say that EPA is central to and leading these efforts and we're moving quickly to get this transformational funding out of the door and today EPA is investing 5.8 billion dollars in drinking water and clean water infrastructure upgrades all across the country.
"I don't care what people say insider advantage is a good pollster, especially in 2020."

"In Arizona, they brought their partisans into doing audit."
"I mean, first off, we know what happened in the election."
Her campaign's been in rural communities.
And here we are and we're some 24 days out now.
It means he's going to be supporting Donald Trump in the state of Michigan.
"Well, he's first of all, Bob Casey is a great American supporting Kamala Harris."
They're trying hard.
"41 percent down from 61 percent four years ago, that's telling to me."
So our goal is really to just support candidates both locally and on the national level that represent our values.
"Coming up next, we'll discuss the latest news concerning, this is not a happy story at all, the investigation into P. Diddy and all the sexual misconduct."
"Good evening, Pennsylvania."
He really is.
"In fact, just in the past couple of weeks, since the insurrection at the Capitol, we have seen in Arizona thousands of members of the Republican Party leave it."
I don't forget the insurrection he tried to lead and failed at leading.
"So is it clear what is happening right now, Dylan, when you look at this sort of dynamic that you just laid out, how conservatives like Jeff Flake, like Cindy McCain, like Doug Ducey, could be considered not conservative enough for those who are most active within the Republican Party in the state of Arizona?"
"I mean, in the sense that given the way our electoral college is structured, Kamala Harris needs to be at least three and a half to four percentage points ahead of Donald Trump because of the popular vote, she gets a lot of extra votes, popular votes in California and Illinois and New York, large states."
"You know, we're in May."
Oh Somebody I got a I got a I got a text at six twenty six twenty Said I heard they might be landing at Luke which would make more sense because it'd be a lot shorter shorter distance Over to the arena and it would not hopefully completely destroy traffic.
"And we can also bring in a lot of new ones, really great ones."
But it seems that that post-debate bump that a lot of analysts expected that she would have is pretty much gone now.
A new general election poll for Pennsylvania is probably the best Pennsylvania reading we've seen in a while.
How will you answer that?
But Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote by two points and lost.
But who do you trust more?
"So I was sitting here with my colleagues, Shari Williams and Ilya Garcia, both candidates, David McCormick and Senator Bob Casey left the room about 15 minutes ago, and you could feel the tension drop significantly."
But we're going to keep working to get our vote out and to get Kamala's vote out to win this race.
"If it was just a straight popular vote, we sort of know how this election would go."
"I think Kamala Harris and her VP pick are much more hopeful and positive for everybody, so I'm looking forward to November."
So she sees that there could be a pattern for her to pick up these counties.
He cared more about winning an election than he did to actually solve the problem.
Scranton's a place that climbs into your heart and it never leaves.
"So, in fact, they said they use the Sharpie's because they don't smudge."
Any final message you would leave for Donald Trump if you were watching this?
But I hear you.
The sample size is 1331.
Let me tell you something.
"Yeah, you know, there are some pollsters, I think, who under represent Republicans."
" Joining us now Jim Greenwood, co-chair of Republicans for Harris in Pennsylvania."
"We're packing the car and heading your way shortly.'"""
"Number two, the state's attorney general, a Democrat told us on CBS this morning, just this morning, that in fact, he was never even CC'd on this list that they sent to attorney general Barr."
He doesn't have to win it to win the state.
"I'd probably vote for her in the primary at this point, but it is what it is."
I was about to say he sounded like a regular.
Absolutely huge.
"Yeah, yeah, no offense, Bernie."
Like The New York Times had like a D plus one electorate.
I'm Tim Miller.
Because we could use a reboot.
"So when we say purple, it doesn't get more purple than this."
This is a big deal because if these are new voters and they're actual Republicans.
At a two percentage point clip.
"So we traveled to Tempe, Arizona, just outside of Phoenix, to sit down with four lifelong Republicans to get their take on the presidential race, how they view Trump and the future of their party."
Because I watched the votes at the end.
The undying bond between men and animals.
"Good afternoon, Pittsburgh."
"But if not, we're ready to go."
So play YMCA.
They're still talking.
"Trump 49, Trump 50."
And that's probably in huge part because she respects the president.
"Because these people cheat, they cheat like dogs."
Let's get started.
So here's another I want you to listen to the sound bite.
And it is scheduled to open up in those affected counties in North Carolina as well as certain parts of Georgia.
I think you're going to see probably Atlas Intel drop another poll and Trafalgar and they're all going to show broadly the same kind of thing as me.
"Ms. Fifield, I really appreciate your time tonight."
All the information's on there.
That is not good for Harris one bit.
D plus three back then.
" We are just 22 days away from Election Day, and Vice President Harris and former President Trump are campaigning in the same battleground state today."
It's a very wild situation.
Donald Trump has had a challenge winning popular votes.
And I'm not talking about going to a fancy steakhouse.
She wants to make it easier to afford stuff like a crib or a car seat or diapers.
"According to some people, Kamala Harris is up by 15 points."
You can't just throw money at a problem and expect it to go away.
The states already marked as solid blue or solid red are those deeply aligned with either side.
Hello.
6.
And so here we are with what I call them the Trump ninjas because the company is cyber ninjas and Doug Logan is their CEO.
How many of you identify as Democrats?
"Navigating these dynamics successfully could very well determine the trajectory of her campaign and shape the overall electoral landscape for years to come, highlighting the intricate dance of voter engagement, sentiment, and electoral strategy that will define the next presidential race."
"You know, he lost the county by 14 votes, literally."
Will I get to the next charging station?
We just said a side Kamala Harris point five said victory.
Hillary Clinton used Fox News to get his birth.
"All right, so you can't tell me that none of that falls back on Kamala."
That's where these Republicans make a huge mistake.
She's not going to win Pennsylvania by four or five points.
We're going to get a little bit closer here.
"You'll get real time alerts and analysis, live blogs, in-depth essays, video highlights and the best 2024 election coverage."
"And obviously people will say, well, you know, there's going to be more mail-in ballots in 2020 because of the pandemic, but this is comparing both Republican and Democrat."
I'm going to ask you one question.
"Yeah, that's been an issue that voters have identified throughout the campaign, whether it was Joe Biden or Kamala Harris leading the Democratic ticket is something that they're very aware of and very concerned about."
God is on our side.
We have oil and gas.
I'm done.
People were dying.
Jill Stein's run for president for 25 fucking years.
Somebody's getting 15 years.
Yes!
Whitmer ends up winning by 10 or 11 points.
"But anyway, like and subscribe."
"This shift comes as Harris steps into the role of presumptive Democratic nominee, revitalizing the party's chances in these critical battlegrounds."
So you have that 44% sort of matching up exactly with the 45% that say they will turn out to vote for him.
"What are you seeing, Sean, in terms of the the ad spend on television?"
"I do want to say that all of us, all 200 of us are so dedicated to reporting the facts and the facts alone."
" All right, good morning."
"Here is what Alina Habba said about the district attorney in Fulton County, Fawny Willis."
"So you're trying to say that these people don't know, you know, they got a dirty establishment or whatever."
"If you get Arizona, if you get Pennsylvania, wait, actually, I think you might need, you might need another state after that."
"And still, it's not moving the needle."
"And when you talk about that white working class vote, Harris just dropping, you know, two, three points, you know, Trump making up some ground just because Joe Biden was a better fit for those voters than somebody like a Kamala Harris."
And taking it to its logical extreme and just saying it out loud and to have Hannity be the one to be appalled at that.
"And still, they could not prove that the election was fraudulent or rigged or that Joe Biden didn't win."
I think there's a lot of work to be done.
Like what's that fire?
"Now, I would argue that that's a little bit high."
And those are the top stories making the headlines in the North American region.
I think both of these states are going to vote fairly similar high working class white population in the state of Wisconsin trending to the red.
"Bob, to almost every time was one of the ones who would stand up in that room with all the other senators from around the country talking about the working people of Pennsylvania and why we needed to have you in our mind when we were thinking about national policy every single day."
Duncan's choice was praised by Shapiro.
"Thanks, guys."
"However, Ohio's suburbs remain more conservative than those in other Midwestern states, which has helped the Republicans maintain a lead in the state."
"Sam, Ms Gabbard, debated Harris back in 2019 during the Democratic primaries."
Thank you very much And now we're gonna pivot over to CBS News campaign reporter Olivia Rinaldi.
"You have others that are a little more maybe a little more social liberal, the Harris."
"Remember, this is a state that he lost by about 80,000 votes."
13.
"So at this point, it's more of a question on the margins."
Don't they?
"And I think, I hope, we're going to see her do that over this final three weeks here."
Harris is leading by just three percentage points nationally and by just one percent in battleground states.
"Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention."
"But I just want to tell you, you are phenomenal people."
Ain't nobody here voting for Kamala Harris.
"Our message to Kamala Harris is yes, we are compassionate people, which is why we want to secure the damn border."
Some of these counties feeling left behind?
Nevada probably his.
It's very formidable.
I think we definitely need the change.
It's part time jobs that aren't valuable.
This 11-point swing is a crucial factor in her overall lead in the state and speaks volumes about the changing dynamics of the American electorate.
"Like, first of all, before you even got to how you're hotter, which is just insanity."
 Hello everybody and welcome back to another EPI video today is October 19th 2024 and we are just 17 days away from the presidential election as well as other very important Congressional elections and elections for governor across these United States So today my main focus was going to be about the state of Pennsylvania.
 President Biden will travel to Pennsylvania today for a campaign rally in his hometown of Scranton.
I see a lot of delicious snacks behind you.
"We're keeping a respectful distance, but allowed and very boisterous crowd."
 We begin tonight with the race for president just 22 days until the election.
"Now, this is the same thing with Philadelphia and the suburbs."
"And when that turnout goes up, it gives more votes to the Republicans."
"Look, I think we need to take the politics out of this pandemic and realize this is a health issue."
So negative.
"Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben."
But what do you think?
"Some people have already voted, and there's very few undecided."
And so that is kind of the target audience for.
I've been around since Barry Goldwater.
"They shifted several points, Democrat."
"Well, the problem with Donald Trump is that when he doesn't have a vision to offer, he starts to go and he starts to personalize attacks."
"I pointed this out some time ago, especially with incumbency."
We got free shipping on orders over $50 and everything is made in the USA.
"Go back to 2016, 2020, 2004."
"The new law that started in 2020, the first time Pennsylvania ever voted in by mail, is still in place lock, stock and barrel."
"If Republicans win either Michigan or Pennsylvania, then the night's over."
"It's your boy, man, Small County J in the building."
Harris is also having formal interviews with candidates who have not been confirmed in the media both in person and virtually according to a source.
"Charlemagne, why did Obama single out black men?"
"Are they moving the stage, or is it in the same place?"
"U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi, a Trump appointee, has restricted what the jury will hear about the personal tragedies that contributed to Biden's addiction, including the deaths of his brother and mother."
Trump could have said this up himself so people will rally behind him so he could win the presidency or somebody fucking missed.
"Now, importantly, this is a wild and baseless conspiracy theory that voting machines in your county were connected to the Internet on Election Day and somehow Italian satellites were utilized to change votes from Trump to Biden."
It's also a concern to environmentalists because of some of the reasons I cited earlier.
"So you could argue, well, maybe just maybe a chunk of this registration surge is because of ancestral Democrats, and it probably is."
"And what they're not factoring in is that the people who held him back, the circuit breaker people, aren't going to be in this administration."
"And what say you, what's your take on these moderates in Pennsylvania who are never Trumpers or pro-Kamala kind of in the middle, whatever your thoughts are."
We have a great military.
"And Alex, you can hear what issues these candidates really believe are most important for them to win this election."
"So it just doesn't really make sense to me as to why, if she really wanted to help the country out, why would she have the ability to do that right now?"
He has a lead in Georgia.
But one sleazebag because I fired him.
"So, you know, you have to communicate that robustly."
"Like Iowa and Ohio, Texas is most likely to fall to Trump by a 10-point margin."
"They have not come to take jobs away from native-born residents, but rather to take jobs that were available, that needed to be done, that nobody was doing at the time when they got there."
"However, some union households have been swayed by Trump's economic and trade policies."
This district's gonna swing back in November.
He would call it a state often.
"It was a tree, all trees."
Played at my grandpa's funeral.
I'm very excited.
"So as you say, it's just as close as it gets."
We'll have to see.
We all know that America became great off the backs of free black labor.
"I know we always say it, but it's usually very true, which is why it's important that we make sure that we get our news from sources that cut through the bias so we know what's really going on."
The second gentleman's head.
Trump commerce to labor to FEMA.
"Shapiro, however, outperformed Biden during his governor's race."
"But it also allows Democrats to move forward to say, we're going to take a vote, we get people lined up on that vote, and then we go, and everybody knows where everybody stands, and we see where we can get later on, which, at this point, even though it doesn't seem like these bills are going to pass, reporting coming out suggesting that there may be some bipartisan agreement on changing this Electoral Count Act of 1887, which would prevent something like a vice president being able to, say, go in and say that he has authority to overturn electoral votes."
Really really interesting.
She's in places like Beaver County.
And pretend to be somebody that they're not.
"In a recent Guardian interview, Moore predicted that Trump could falter under pressure, possibly resulting in unpredictable behavior on live TV."
"And not just as a governor, but as a father of four, I try and raise our kids to love thy neighbor, to care about their fellow man, their fellow woman."
That's at least a five point swing.
We're for fracking.
But this isn't the only thing that she's flipped on that you found and you found a lot of other inconsistencies.
"And of course, she has her E.V."
Let's bring it home.
"No, these things are all planned."
He's ahead comfortably there.
"Now, with Harris carrying the Democratic torch and Trump eyeing a comeback, Pennsylvania is once again in the spotlight."
"So when you take positions like that, you're going to get knocked around as I have."
And here's where I believe things are going on.
"That's going to be very, very important."
"It's really, really good."
"But there are a lot of Republicans who have decided that they're coming out not just to vote for Harrison Walls, but to campaign for them."
We were supposed to be getting out of people's lives and respecting how they choose to live and respecting that in harmony.
And apparently the internals have Trump up by around two to five points in Pennsylvania as of now.
He's in Detroit.
"And here's Pete Buttigieg, still isn't on board, still doesn't understand the lay of the land."
And the competition between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is tightening by the day.
"It is simply incomprehensible to me, ultimately a dereliction of duty, because the title commander predisposed as chief."
"If Pennsylvania becomes a three four point state for Kamala Harris, she's winning Georgia."
And that path to breaking through might begin with answering the question posed to you in the first place.
"But in a presidential year, it's a little bit different and that we know."
"That window of time between the polls closing and races being called, I think has shown to be a real vulnerability where people seeking to undermine confidence in those results if they're going to lose have really exploded."
Previously it appeared that the race post debate had frozen in place with neither candidate with any clear momentum.
"All right, let's go across to California."
I'm kidding.
"Yeah, it has."
"And because Pennsylvania is a smaller version of America, you know, that's in terms of the urban and rural and suburban."
"Pennsylvania, with its 19 electoral votes, has long been a pivotal state in presidential elections."
Cynthia Sabatini knows a lot about the change here.
"For one, the economy is top of mind for many voters."
It is not compassionate to allow the Mexican drug cartels to sex traffic children into the United States of America.
That number's been reported.
I'm excited that he's working with Trump.
"One, do those numbers match your internal numbers, Senator?"
And the computer was freaking out about it tells you literally how the next supercharged station you can go to.
We're fighting for the right of our citizens to be able to turn on the heating in the middle of a cold winter night.
And that's what Dr. Oz did.
And we will win.
"The point is, if you elect Kamala and Tim, they will not be focused on their problems."
The Daily Mail came out with some reporting today based on different modeling that they had that said that Trump was ahead by almost 10 points at the electoral college.
But I can tell you this.
Let's say it one more time.
We can see that it's clearly dead heat.
I'll tell you.
Trump had about 62% to Secretary Clinton 33.
"But I'm just curious, as you've been covering this election, as we know, it's unprecedented what we're dealing with right now."
And you will be sitting in the red and blue chair tonight.
So this is a county that both campaigns are fighting to win.
So a few things.
That is where Phoenix is.
I get the crispy chicken with a medium fry.
She's abandoning us in Washington DC.
So that's where he's been on this issue.
"We're, we're, we are, um, I think the epicenter of our democracy."
"By God, I'll tell you, it's a means of supply and what they're running around here complaining in this and it's these radicals."
"Sadly, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania discusses the approaching election in 2024, the campaign strategy of Harris, and the importance of the state as a battleground in his speech."
I hate Josh Appeiro.
And I see the former president en route to win the state by perhaps two to four points.
"I'm sorry, I don't know if he's paid, but he's a ballot counting observer for the Trump campaign in Nevada for the last two weeks."
It showed that there's a certain love of a country when they do that.
When did that become OK?
We talked a few weeks ago in Tucson.
And the clock is ticking.
"Bowers was questioned by January 6th committee member, Congress member Adam Schiff, a Democrat of California."
"Mercer said, quote, Republican leadership in North Carolina is tested and has proven to have a superior ground game."
I imagine this has been a pretty strange day.
But anyway switching gears a little bit from one state to another and from one sense to another of the campaign we are in the final few weeks and we've noticed that there's been kind of an explosion in populist economics from both campaigns in these closing weeks.
"These are the mail in voters, the mail in voters, not these, you know, early in person voters, which Republicans have a sizable advantage with."
And he also keeps a kosher kitchen.
So Donald Trump constantly on Fox News doing the birtherism thing.
There's four hundred and seventy eight thousand registered voter and voters.
And he spoke to those who may still be undecided.
And they also want to reduce the cost of child care.
And then he talks about the lowest unemployment rate.
Depending on which way those votes go.
"I mean, just take a look at the US Senate race."
"Speaking of Trump, I read that he's holding a big fundraiser in Palm Beach that I expected to raise $43 million for his campaign."
"And so to your point in this election, we will answer the call again."
"And for people who say, I don't know, I don't know if I can vote for Donald Trump, the one thing that you cannot question is his children."
That we're not getting social security.
"When it was over there, it was perfect."
"OK, so Tim Wals is but Andy Bashir's all over TV this weekend."
"However, Harris also understands the need to distinguish herself."
"Both voters remain firmly undecided, but newly energized."
CBS News has learned she even had a phone call with the 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to get her advice on debating Donald Trump.
They were trying to basically go away with the Secret Service and it's so odd that now they feel as though that the Secret Service didn't really step up to protect Trump in a way that they should have.
Isn't it a little beneath you to buy a sexy outfit to make me jealous?
"But President Trump conducting diplomacy with our enemies, I think was very was very important for for our country to maintain our status as the world's number one superpower."
So I wish I could tell you that this presidential race is going to be exciting.
"Starting with Franklin and Marshall, back in April they had a registered voter survey that showed Biden dominating Trump 38-48."
"We're not gonna look at the Rasmussen one, we're gonna look at Muhlenberger, right?"
"And of course, the will of the people will be respected."
We will be there covering the rally tomorrow but for now reporting from Sky Harbor International Airport Nicole Christine Fox 10 News.
"Last night, as you mentioned before, Brian Fitzpatrick had a very competitive primary against a challenger that was further to the right."
It's not like done in a sec.
What the hell is his name?
Shout out to Philadelphia.
"I mean, one, I mean, it's interesting that he feels like he just needs to unleash, unload everything that he's got on her."
"But I highly doubt that the vast majority of these new Republicans, they're just former Democrats."
Just all there is to it.
When did that become okay?
Also want to ask you about some of the other foreign policy issues that came up during the debate.
"She just here, if you read the lawsuit, she has every right to file it, every right to file it, but a lot of it is recycling 2020 stuff and there's no evidence to back up to this year's stuff."
But what if that isn't the case?
So always good when you guys are able to stay on the road there.
"Now, we got a few clips of when they get to shout out to Linpett and for posting these."
"Yesterday, we heard Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina say on one of the Sunday shows, on several of the Sunday shows, the reason we need to go ahead is, we need to know where you stand."
"Now, I want to be clear that I am not saying there is no pathway for Trump if he loses Pennsylvania."
And will it be by enough to give Trump the victory in Pennsylvania?
"So, Mr. Tough Guy on China, except when he can make a few bucks, hawking his Trump edition Bibles."
"We already knew that, right?"
I really appreciate it.
But that's what Harris walls are all about.
"Look, at the end of the day, do I think heels up is going to win?"
Ego.
It's not good.

So what will President Trump be doing during the DNC?
And so I also encourage us not to overread into this moment.
I blame his failed policies.
And we're Donald Trump can't hold a candle to what we are doing every day because he is just full of empty promises that have quite literally raised costs for the middle class and made it harder for them to get ahead.

"This was this weekend and this is part of what this MAGA movement has become, calls to decertify elections even when their own sham audits, which aren't valid and wouldn't change the outcome anyway, actually found that Trump lost by even more than he thought."

"Plus one even, Redfield and Emerson."

Because when we met last week you were undecided.

"And of course, Vice President Kamala Harris denounced some of that as well."
"So if she was to nominate him to be the VP, that would probably hurt her more nationally, even if it would give her a bit of a boost in Pennsylvania, which is probably why they selected the Kami teacher, quote unquote, from Minnesota by way of Nebraska and Tim Walts."
Y'all see I did a video yesterday about how they needed a Kamala needed a homeless people Homeless people to support her.

"So there's a possibility and some people have argued this, and I'm not denying this one bit, but there's a good possibility that at least a chunk of these new Republicans, they could just be ancestral Democrats that are finally Republicans, but that doesn't mean they actually changed parties."
"So it's complicated, you know, in terms of how we look at it, but the inside battle for it and the likelihood of it being the tipping point state is so high."
"The real clear politics aggregate for Pennsylvania is exactly tied right now, even with Bloomberg Morning Consult throwing in a Harris plus five that's way out in left field."

"She refused to do so and thus was, you know, not allowed to cast the ballot."
I'm excited for Kamala.
Thank you guys.
"That's it for this one, folks!"
And Kamala is not the answer.
Well I think that's a great way to kind of wrap things up and especially on where things are right now where things can be going direction in the future because of course in the event that Donald Trump is elected on November the 5th and over the 6th the 2028 campaign begins effectively.
That's a great way to lose.

Where do you come out on?
He joins us live outside of Shapiro's Jenkins Town home with what voters think about the potential pairing here.
"Trump made comments criticizing Biden-Harris policies, focusing on the border and public safety."
Indicating a consolidation of support that once leaned towards third-party candidates or was undecided.
"They had no reason for doing it, but they wanted to try and take me off the ballot."
"She pulled behind, but now all of a sudden everybody likes her and she's bringing new energy into the party."
He was super friendly and I had zero expectation.
"Because while I appreciate that you've been willing to speak out against the lies being spewed by Donald Trump, the fact that you're still voting for him makes your defense of your Haitian constituents ring pretty hollow."

"However in their poll just after the debate they got the same result, showing no gains for either candidate."
"And again, Kamala Harris had a nice little surge in the betting odds today."
McClelland and Shapiro's office did not respond to requests for comment.
"If MSNBC reported more like CNN, and this is not an endorsement of the fairness of CNN, although I will tell you I do not over and over again see CNN hosts banging away at Trump's dictator with spittle flying from their mouths the same way I do on MSNBC."
Now there's more.
"I said, to what end?"
I remember being at the RNC.
"No, but it's the same polls pulling the same crap that they did back in 2020, back in 2016."
Robert O'Brien is the one that I think really led the charge.

We talk about a split screen.
"Momma, Kamala, just don't give a frack."
And then what happens?
"These are people that have killed people, unvetted."
And then the calibration or the certification of those ballots is covered up by the machine.

What I have seen is that we can we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.
"And a quick reminder that we were told for weeks now, no, for about a month now that Kamala Harris's best polling was going to happen in August."
This assigns the Vice President 109 electoral votes.

And so they also published an article talking about the worst three weeks of Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.
"Democrats have gone down, down, down, down while Republicans have gone up and up and up."

We're talking with folks.
How does that work?
"And if you're in Pennsylvania, vote."
"Noah, meantime, former President Donald Trump is set to make his second trip to southern Arizona in less than 30 days."

He will speak on night one of the DNC on Monday and then kind of pass the baton off to the Vice President.

"You vote for a leader who sees you, who has a plan to serve you, and is willing to acknowledge that there are weaknesses in our existing policies."

"We're talking about Pennsylvania, of course."
So what we need to do is to evaluate the plans of the respective candidates.
"If it's Harris plus one right now, that's not good, but it does show a consistent trend compared to just a week ago, a week ago, you had the New York Times Quinnipiac finding Harris plus three Harris plus four."

"But this also comes as our CBS News polling from this weekend shows that the script has been flipped in the last couple weeks since the last debate that Donald Trump is now seen as in the red, no pun intended, on having a weakness among voters about who voters see as the most competent and able-bodied to be president."
Seven percent of that came from Montgomery County.

"So See so there's so as this advertising executive Says there's not really a reason to believe she can approach the numbers by and was able to get last time it doesn't mean she can't win the state but It's it's concerning and It's a big demographic also I just don't think she appeals to the white non-college educated or what would in class vote is nearly as well as binding good as Shown in the teamsters polling, but you can see this here It's not very good for Harris and obviously the Irish sense of history, you know that that's a thing but um She just doesn't connect to it and it's a problem and I know something striking I want I'll display here because obviously You know Bob Casey Jr. Is running for reelection and he is running for reelection Leading by just under four points and with the exception of you mess little and Quinnipiac Every other poll has been two or four points."
"Analyzing these results, we can clearly see that the results are shifting towards blue."
So yeah they're just not into Kamala Harris.
"That's, you know, with debates, it's not just performance, it's expectations."
Deeper issues?
"But if you get that margin, now you're talking about the Senate race is getting a lot better in the rust belt for Republicans, even though Wisconsin is potentially in play if Trump can win it by two and a half to three."
So it was more about actually being particularly accurate and not the other way around.
We got a lot of dancing for about 40 minutes last night.

"When he was up against Biden, the first real thing that we saw was that in the most, in the time where the Democratic Party needed to unify the most, they were not unified because many members of Congress, senators, governors had concerns about President Biden's viability."
I think that's why it's what does Trump use?
It's a huge thing.
"And she is also a no-9-11 truther, has spread conspiracy theories about 9-11."
I want to be someone who treats people with respect.
"I've never been a red, maggot wearing guy."

"In his aqua net muddled brain, he turns little crowds into big crowds, into huge crowds."

"You important data people like to call it a tipping point state, it looks like Pennsylvania could be the tipping point state, which means the one state that will decide the election."

"Well, what did Kamala Harris do Saturday night in Las Vegas, but say I support ending taxes on tips, as well as raising the minimum wage for workers who have those lower minimum wage levels of roughly $2 in change in some states, definitely below the federal average, because your employer is presuming that you're going to make a lot more in terms of tipped wages as well."
That's the role of social media in all of this.
"So it's one thing to show up, but it's another thing to actually listen and understand the needs of that community."
"This is a must-win situation, must-win."
"It's sort of naturally what leads to inflation is that when the government spends more than it brings in, that's what causes inflation."

And these areas are super Republican.
And this is exactly where President Biden was just a few days ago.
She is Republican and anti-abortion and applauds Trump for his role in overturning Roe v. Wade.
"Now, I want to go over why this is a big deal that Harris is potentially in deep trouble in Pennsylvania."
They'll end it immediately.
I mean?
"The catch here is that among this group of voters, black voters specifically talking about these voters, they tend to lag behind white voters when it comes to voter turnout."

"You know, they vote in the past two presidential elections, past two midterm elections."
"And Jay, Harris is getting some good polling this morning in the Sunbelt states."
"Meanwhile, the Times is reporting that the FBI had an informant during the insurrection, a member of the Proud Boys who was reportedly texting his own FBI handler during that fateful insurrection, but maintaining they had no plans to enter the Capitol itself."
"Maybe it gets a little bit tighter, but they were trying to get Biden out and that's when those polls came out and they had Trump up by five or six and basically all the Rust Belt states."
I expect the polling here will understate Trump once more.

"Debbie, thank you for having us back."
"Economics, we all know will be a big part of this."
"And I believe that she could very well lose the state by two to three points when it's all said and done, depending on how things go over the next 35 days."

A part of it is Democrats switching their party registration to Republican.

Then we'll just have to go through the same process that we did last time.
And there has to be a law against it.
Vote for Kamala Harris.
And I think that Trump wins.

"But I'll tell you, I'm offended by that."
I Personally spoke with him.
Democrats had their best polling on average in August.
So Wisconsin 8.6% lead for Biden and he only ended up winning by 0.7 So you can see that it was a absolutely massive or 7.9 on Election Day We'll say 7.9 and he she only win one by point seven so or it's 8.4 on Election Day So he only won by point seven.
"Ultimately, he won it by barely one point two."

"And I think as the Kamala Harris and Tim Walz campaign has been driving home on that point, it's something that's resonating in places especially like Pennsylvania with such a high percentage of blue collar workers."
"We are going to be looking at the numbers in Pennsylvania, not just some of the polling numbers."
But Democrats were meddling in the Republican primaries down ballot for governor.

"I'm sure you guys are feeling it, too."

And tonight there is a new poll from CBS News.
"But if Trump's up by two to three in Pennsylvania, more than likely, he's going to win the other swing states, especially in the Rust Belt."

You might even say Northampton County could even be like a bellwether of the entire country.
We're already going into World War III.
And it's not just Rasmussen.
We'll see on the day after.
I think it's fair to say Trump lies more in Kamala Harris.

Clinton plus six.
You're a lawyer yourself.
"A state Republicans won the governorship back in 2021, though no Republican has held Virginia since 2004."
"Biden won the state by around 81,000 votes."
The lap dog definitely was a memorable one.

"So you know, that's the work I did at AG."
Guns take away their right to free speech.
She's focusing on these northern battleground states to try to put up a fight against former president Donald Trump.
It's about values.

"And they are so well aware that even though this area in particular voted for President Biden back in 2020, there is plenty of opportunity for her to lose, which is why she's trying to meet face to face with as many people as she can to try to get her message across."
Why does this matter?

"Pennsylvania is a super, super close state and a super, super crucial state for both political parties."
These numbers look amazing for Trump.
"It's not so much that we agree with her, but we simply cannot deal with a minimum of four more years of that."
Like some Democrats are wondering why she hasn't been used more effectively as a surrogate for Harris.
"They actually found the very same thing that the other multiple audits found that President Joe Biden one, I think they found maybe six or 10 or 20 more votes for him."

The state has been called the keystone of the Electoral College.
"I think Black women in particular are going to support Vice President Harris and they have galvanized, they have mobilized to help her win this election."
Where's the t-shirt for Yuvaldi?
Why are people?
And it's certainly distinct and different from Donald Trump.
She's trying to make the contrast.
And it's not like she's starting to like run away with this election in the polling.

That sounds silly.
"Uh, there there was no fraud in the election."
"Hell, some of them voted for Obama, I believe."
I survived the shooting.
"Now, you mentioned that this poll doesn't bring a lot of clarity."
"Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, very different."
Aquafina plays that unsuspecting winner.
So it's like this false narrative that's being pushed.
Thanks always for making time to talk to us.
How long does it take to process each ballot?
"We do still have two states to go though, up here in the Northeast."
Donald Trump putting in the work also in Pennsylvania.
"And there's a quite, there's a lot of votes in the Allegheny County, it's Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas, the uninitiated here."

"I can't say that I've done it perfectly or that I'm doing it just great, but I'm doing the best I can to elevate the voices in this time of deep pain for the tens of thousands of residents that have called me, contacted me, that have come to our council chambers talking about the sheer death and destruction that they see each and every single day."
And I remember this came up during the debate.
And together we'll keep building a country that's more fair and more equal and more just and more free.
"Over the weekend, the Trump campaign claimed it was recently hacked, and it's now blaming Iran for the data breach."
"And at this point, and I also want people to understand, you know, and it's not science, but there is there is energy and there's kinds of anger on the ground in Pennsylvania."
"Actually, he I had hosted him on May 1st and he had whispered something to my family on the night of the debate."
I was on the ground in Pennsylvania covering this for the primary.
"They've seen in recent elections, some very good luck with people like John Federman and Josh Shapiro winning in 2022, and then other circumstances where sometimes it's not as lucky."
"And so there are a lot of us who realize that we can contain the multitudes, that it's country over party."
Take it down to 14.
"And in fact, these numbers are going to get even worse for Democrats because guess what?"
You can't exactly do that.
Policies and the person.
"And on that, I mean, there's a lot of speculation that the minute she actually has to do that and debate Trump, that's when it's quite possible."
Black people didn't do this.
We also know she ran against Madeline Dean a Democratic member of Congress in suburban Philadelphia lost by 30 which that's what you're going to do in 2018 against was was it 2018 or 2020.
The Cash App link is in the description.
"Never been a chef or nothing like that, but talking about cooking and opening the restaurant, that's relatable to people."
And so Kamala Harris now narrowing down even pre-VP selection in Pennsylvania goes to show that Democrats are in a far better position.
Listen to it.
Names.
And I think what we'll be most telling is when reporters are out there at the polls talking to voters I'm going to be curious to say to see more about why voters say they're supporting X Y and Z.

"And like, no, that's just to start though."
"No, no, no, I'm not."
"Today, we've got a whirlwind of news to cover, so let's dive right in."
We're winning Pennsylvania by a tremendous amount of it.
"Now I know, I know, we're Republicans."
"This is about Republicans looking forward and saying, you know, in the next time, can they sow that kind of doubt and maybe just turn a few people's votes, a few key people, and then hand the election to the Republicans even though they wouldn't have won it in a democracy?"
This is where it's going to be won.
That'd be great if you have a good evening.
And it's clear Donald Trump is having a whole lot of buyer's remorse.
That's his definition of freedom.
It was Clinton plus six.
Tammy Baldwin is winning.
If this was not staged this is the first war.
"And so Fox News fuels this birtherism, which then fuels Trump and now is utterly appalled that they're losing control of it."
It's probably going to take at least until this weekend to get through the majority of those remaining ballots.
"Because I think for the world, even, he's become a laughingstock when it comes to our foreign policy."
But here she is.
"Looking at Wisconsin, as I felt will be closer and in my opinion, harder to win for Harris and likely win for Trump here, given how close it's been in the past with a large secret Trump vote out there."
Harris is not ahead and even one.
We have to talk with the 2024 presidential election because it appears that Donald Trump's in a great position to win the swing state of Pennsylvania.
"And it's not just like, oh, he's down by one."
"But in Michigan, you know, we had this Detroit event, and like I said, and it's all that in two minutes."
"But if she loses it, well, it becomes very difficult."

I remember the inflation much higher from the 1970s.
Your reaction.
Can you raise your hand for me if you're going to vote for Vice President Harris in November?
"If it's tied, that's good."
I want to play a little bit of what she said at a rally in North Carolina.
It's not going to win talking about whether she's dumb.
Let's put up her recent tweet that's responding to criticism.
Duh.
"No, he cannot lose any of these states except Nevada."
"Like I said, they're probably more used to than just about any place in the country having reporters come in and ask them questions before an election because we always do it."

What we were saying when she made the pick was do no harm.
"Yeah, I mean, I would agree."
Vote Vote.
I think Kamala Harris has the momentum and is moving in the right direction and showing signs that she clearly understands how to campaign in our Commonwealth.

Trump is down to 47.7.
"Right now, they would probably go on record to send you Barry Goldwater as well."
"Yeah, I mean, you can't deny it's a huge part of how people get their news now, especially like younger voters."
They're scared to death of them.
"If I thought, there's a 50%, 30% chances my opponent's gonna drop out, I wouldn't make contingency plans."
But there's a process that this requires.
So you're definitely seeing Harris underperforming Clinton and Biden in big ways.
"And then the other thing I just want to observe today, there is another criticism, which you didn't ask, but I'm going to ask it and knock it down myself, which is progressive folks are like, should she be campaigning with Liz?"

"It's a powerful tool for actually getting people involved, you know, organizing, campaigning, all that."
Kamala is the new fighter.

"Yeah, I think that's going to be a central question of this election because we've seen across the country since the overturning of Roe every time an abortion measure was on the ballot it has passed."
"And so for anyone that's trying to change history on that or change the perspective on that in a positive way and put a spin on it in that regard, I can't vote for them."
"For that matter, do you think Donald Trump has ever changed a tire in his life?"
I feel better.
"And he refused to do anything about it, as even his closest allies privately pleaded with his chief of staff to put a stop to the riot."
"We have brand new early voting data that suggests, uh, no, it's not looking good for Democrats whatsoever."
"Even if you had a family member who acted like that, you might still love them, but you tell them you've got a problem."
Mr. Trump went on to praise the Arizona State Senate for its ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County.
We ate our friend Claire to stay alive.
"Hell, Trump was not even leading in virtually any poll."
"I think that's about my quick math is that's about three and a half or four points for Kamala Harris, all the polling since the debate."
I think you're going to see the same thing happen come November.
Let me know in the comments below.
"Now what liberals will claim is, Oh, Rasmussen is, I mean, even if you want to say that it's, it's biased to Trump, NBC news, Quinnipiac, Marquette, how bad is Marquette been this cycle?"
"We're all humans, human endeavor means you will have partisan beliefs, what they choose to put in their polling averages is unlike what we see on 538, which has Kamala Harris ahead in the 538 average, unlike what we see on VoteHub, unlike what we see on other organizations that do the same work."
"Ryan, same question for you."
It's a path that can be fraught.
Trump?
"In 2020, for example, high turnout in these areas helped Biden secure his victory in the state."
 President Kamala Harris.
"But this is huge, huge news."
And it's a little bit beforehand in some of these places and we have new data out of Nevada and Arizona.
Again an election which shares a lot of overlap with 2024.
"It they understated Trump by a lot until the very end, when by some miracle, the polls became very close."
But just there's so many things you could look at and see the absolute insanity of these people.
I'm the only governor in the entire country with a divided legislature.
WRL's Laura Levine is in Greensboro where another crowd will greet her this evening for that second stop.
"But as Mary Alice was just pointing out, the race is still really close."
Possibly.
Think about that and ask yourself what you can do from now until then to make sure it doesn't happen.
"So it's unclear, but there have been a lot of indications in Pennsylvania that perhaps things are leaning Trump's way."
58 to 42.
But look at polls that have come out over the last week or so and what do we see?
"And I say, yeah, yeah, it was good, because it was my economy that I gave to them."
Walk us through why Pennsylvania matters so much.
Everybody says it could determine the outcome.
"Now, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken now in a visit aimed at intensifying diplomatic pressure to achieve a Gaza ceasefire deal."
"And therefore there was more room to find compromise, not anymore."
"You know, Hannah, I'm in Bucks County."
Harris finished six points ahead of Trump in this poll.
And so they're out there doing more of these interviews.
"Starting from the beginning to the end, I love the point that every single creator made in this video."
"His campaign says this is their closing message, that they are wrapping their arms around it."
"And throughout every chapter in our American story, when we have been tested, we've put our country first, we've put our patriotic tendencies first."
So I'm calling on Congress to pass this bill against my desk immediately.
Just because the S&P 500s had an all-time high doesn't mean that gas isn't higher than it was several years ago.
This shouldn't even be a question.
How how the hell is this a high-quality poll?
Trump doesn't have a message.
A Republican city commissioner in Philadelphia put the odds of knowing the winner on election night at almost zero.
Look at that.
So that's a big shift there in terms of moving those numbers around.
They want a more sophisticated understanding of how to engage with diverse voting blocs.
It's just that his numbers are usually fake in the wrong direction for you.
" Welcome to Trendy Flix, your ultimate destination for the latest in movies, TV shows, and streaming trends."
"Because let's face it, I'm a little out of practice."
People have accused the polly market of not being very accurate this time.
That's the biggest problem for Trump.
So I mean that should tell you everything you need to know.
Harris has been working hard to inspire voters and avoid the enthusiasm deficit that plagued Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016.
"He says he's going to take another question, then changes his mind and then calls Democrats evil."
It's a lot of merchandise and merchandise.
"And this time, we're really digging into the 2024 election."
"So like I said, Dr. Oz and McCormick both are awful."
"I know, I don't even want to give them tips."
Are you seeing across the country some of the Republicans who are supportive of abortion rights being a little bit wary of Trump who nominated people to the Supreme Court who overturned Roe v. Wade?
So we talk about youth voters often.
"And you wonder, can he get it done if he wins a second term?"
"So basically, if we look at the suburban area of Philadelphia right now, it is what's carrying the water in this area."
So for 12 days a year Pittsburgh would be required to allow rodeos to happen within within the city limits.
"And they don't know why they should trust Kamala Hara, who's had four years to do something and hasn't done anything and now is acting like she's going to change all this around."
The race is still too close to call and the Harris campaign is deploying its big guns to help seal the deal.
Ohio used to be a swing state.
Look at all this.
"I mean, not like everybody's going to do hard work, two weeks left continuing to push, you know, but speaking to those, you know, back in the old days, they called them Reagan Democrats, like that, from Macomb County."
"If there's an encouraging signal from all of this for crypto, it's that Bitcoin won't fall much more."
You have a lot of pollsters in here that are not these right-leaning polls.
"â€”On the other side, you have someone who has consistently shown disregard, not just for the communities, but for you as a person."
Where do you want to begin?
"Four years later, President Joe Biden won by just over 1%."
Jay.
"Here, play the clip."
"I mean, it's going to be too expensive for number one, for somebody to buy a house."
"And yeah, bro, comments is just what y'all are, but we need to react to the next."
"So it was Pennsylvania, we can see."
"Good morning, Vlad."
"Adriana, it was a series of explosive sounds just about five minutes into the President's rally, the former President's rally here in Butler County, Pennsylvania."
What are they focusing on for November?
"They have Trump plus two suspiciously, right?"
This is a topic that can be tough.
Don't don't mistake him.
"There's a real sense inside the Harris campaign that in Western Pennsylvania, in exurban, in rural areas, the Trump campaign as it did in 2016 and 2020 is going to do pretty well."
Let's take a look at the next clip.
"And we're going to be very, we're going to have our choice."
Let's go back to the beginning of June before the debate on June 27th.
Welcome back to Square Off.
"So he's up by two points, according to Emerson."
I believe that they don't have to do anything differently.
So I certainly love Joe.
"And in Michigan, Donald Trump has been leading in the polls after trailing essentially from the time Harris entered the contest."
Kamala Harris received 50% of the vote and Donald Trump 44%.
But now they've got them.
"If we give Pennsylvania five points, Kamala Harris put in the lean column that cuts off Trump's most important swing state for winning this election."
I'm a Republican and I'm here to support Obama.
They are allowed then to focus on other people.
What I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a clean energy economy without banning fracking.
"If Harris were to win this state and keep those upper Midwest states, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, that's most likely the ballgame."
You don't have to vote for this administration again.
Maybe.
 They have been relentlessly attacking each other on the campaign trail and now Vice President Harris and former President Trump will be coming face to face for tonight's debate.
"And if she's elected, the entire country will turn into a migrant camp."
A whole lot of Eagles and Steelers in your fantasy draft.
Notice how all of these people are having to readjust their numbers down.
Some of them are being particularly hostile.
"You don't explain a consistent trend of Republicans out-registered Democrats 2 to 1, 3 to 1."
"But when you go to the RCP average, you would think, oh, with Trump being tied with Marist, tied in the Washington Post, up with Emerson, up with insider advantage, you would think the RCP average would be Trump plus one or even like Trump plus 0.5."
We're taking it back.
"In the third poll, conducted by Redfield and Wilton Strategies, from August 12 to 15, with 825 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 44%."
You lose it.
Yeah Can you get me tickets to see Taylor?
"But then in this question, when offered some options after being told that one million immigrants enter this country legally every year, MSNBC viewers, a pretty good portion of them, one third want a level of legal immigration lower than it currently is."
That's it's murder.
Forty three percent for MSNBC viewers.
And then you have Bucks County where the registration date is moving right off a cliff.
We're going to meet an artist a sculptor who was inspired with you know when he stood up and did this you know raised his fist and after the shooting happened with the blood running down the side of his face to make a sculpture of that.
"He had that bronzer on thick and before our eyes, we someone who's truly in cognitive decline right there."
They want to work like hell and they want to clean out our country and straighten out our country.
We'd have to find common ground.
You see why Pennsylvania is so critical.
"She's going to have to do all the press conference, which she has refused to do."
"What it is going to do is cause more and more citizens to lose faith in our democracy, to lose faith in their voices and to potentially disengage and certainly have access to less accurate information."
They become more and more worthless the more and more the government prints.
"President Trump is somebody that I appreciate for his fight, his tenacity, his wisdom, and his ability to get things done."
"Well, since day one, I observed him to be a man who is not mentally fit for the job."
Is that who you're trying to educate?
"Oh, my God, you absolute dip-beep."
Make peace with the fact that that man is about to be president.
"Where this section of border wall built during the Trump years abruptly ends, he lost before it could be completed, cartels who often abuse and exploit migrants then leave them here at the doorstep of America."
He's nearing 50 percent and then the Emerson poll trumps up by four in Pennsylvania in the Fox News poll.
"Right, let's get this question because I believe that's what this is about."
In relationship to former President Trump.
"But before you praise State Senator Bartolotta too much, keep in mind that she is not only a Republican, even after the things he said about Charleroi and its good, hardworking people who are doing their best to take care of their families, she's also still a Trump supporter."
"So that has major implications going forward, especially when you have election deniers in these very critical races."
All the other pollsters ended up missing by more than that.
Pennsylvania Dem issues warning to Harris about potential Josh Shapiro VP pick.
"But either way, the fact is, despite having a big outlier, it's only Harris plus point four."
The Democratic establishment is cheering the choice of Walz as well.
I figured that's a lot.
So he lives 45 minutes apart.
"Yet right now in the RCP average, despite being down by five points in 2020, being down by seven points in 2016, Trump is leading the RCP average."
That's the car that we're driving.
It's opposite.
"We're getting We'll be right back Or no, actually we'll keep going we're getting the first reaction to debate from our focus group from voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Phil Mattingly is with them in Erie, Pennsylvania."
"Uh, there's good numbers in, in Pennsylvania with their fake firewall."
"Because for a while in the immediate aftermath of Joe Biden dropping out of the race, Kamala Harris was polling roughly four points behind Donald Trump in the first set of polls that were released."
" Sloth, you're gonna live with me now."
"And you have a shot, I'm told, at Scott Perry and Harrisburg and York."
This reality underscores the critical importance of a comprehensive and inclusive campaign strategy that seeks to unify rather than divide the electorate.
"Also, please remember to share this video with your friends and family if you really, really, really like the video."
He was an extremely charismatic public figure The court documents explicitly make it clear that trump was never at his island or his house Not even once the victim's text testified to this In court Or i'm sorry this fact in court trump even banned him from his club for harassing young women This is public record.
I could see that.
"So governor, I know you visit, but I just want to say that I have faith that Senate cases go in reelection because he is being advised by your dear friend and the Eskimo South Shore."
I think everybody agrees you can't lose Pennsylvania and win the election.
That's battleground Arizona right there.
And that is substantial.
"Well, that's great."
"So this time around, his campaign is hoping to increase support for him wherever possible."
The campaign has really spent a lot of time focusing on the central and western part of the state.
So it's gonna get weirder before it gets more normal.
"Compared to our August, when 46 percent had her favorable, 48 percent unfavorable, that is now flipped."
What did she expect you guys?
And I think they're the and it should be very easily handled by if necessary by national God or if really necessary by the military.
But Trump is winning big among older voters here.
You got it.
But we've got to fight like the Democrats do in order to win.
The verdict in the Trump trial.
"But other than that, I mean the guy's in great shape and Trump has lost a couple pounds since the election ended."
And I think Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will win at the national level.
"I mean, look at those numbers there within the margin of error."
"I'm curious, so both were recently in Pennsylvania."
And I didn't want to have that in the House.
"As the Democratic National Convention approaches, Harris's upcoming speech is anticipated to further boost her campaign, setting the stage for a crucial period leading up to the presidential debate and the start of early voting."
It's not right.
And I think that also makes a lot of sense.
Right now we have 16 million jobs added.
You don't want who in?
The same thing goes for Wisconsin.
"Both Flake and McCain endorsed President Biden in the election, while Ducey was targeted for his implementation of COVID-19 restrictions."
"Nadia Brown, a professor of government and chair of the women's and gender studies program at Georgetown University, and a Delta Sigma Theta sorority number, said members have already shored up behind the vice president."
Subscribe share with your friends.
Usually presidential candidates have months to sort out their vp picks.
"We have Bob Costa in Pennsylvania, who will be joining us from the road."
"Put in whatever P you want, whatever his polling number is."
"I mean, you know, there's something, I don't know, my first grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, attended my law school graduation."
That's one of the things I feel like we've been missing a lot of recently.
There's more Trump Vance.
There are independents in there and they become friends throughout this process.
"OK, do you notice who he's speaking to right now?"
So I think she has to articulate that tonight.
Our panel's here.
We understand what he represents.
The polling story seems to be similar in other swing states.
Polling isn't everything.
That's incredible.
It's shifted six points.
"There is Eric Schmidt, the attorney general, and there's Eric Greitens, the former governor."
We saw a group of people inciting people.
Anything worth having is worth fighting for.
"Is pickleball an escape from politics, maybe?"
It's fake news.
"Right now Trump's up by, you know, point two percent and that's with an outlier."
"Very interesting circumstances, very good news for the Democratic Party that they're doing quite well with Kamala Harris, Pennsylvania now expanding and included on that map of states that are now on the radar to be even more in the advanced column for the Democratic Party, especially with Governor Tim Walz on this ticket."
Everyone knows this.
"But look, I think as as people go forward and begin to really deliberate about this election, I think they're seeing that difference."
She believes in entrepreneurship.
"The suburban surge, Harris's key to victory?"
Trump is winning in every single swing state.
There is just Doug Logan and whoever his people are with our ballots.
We have 29 days.
"If somebody says, well, I'm thinking about voting for Trump because I remember the economy being pretty good, remind him why it was good."
Why is he traveling to central Pennsylvania?
It shouldn't just be due to um misuse of our Female and male body parts.
UConn's men and women's teams are both in the Final Four.
It's nice to see a two as the first number.
The candidates are tied in the battleground states.
"If you found this analysis insightful, don't forget to like, subscribe to Global News Network, and drop a comment below."
"In fact, a lot of people were conflating this for firecrackers that didn't go down until they saw the former president get rushed by his security detail."
So the Kennedy campaign has been a disaster from the very beginning.
It's not just about policies that are on the ballot it is about values and it is about character.
A little tiny shift in Philadelphia in terms of raw vote percentages and turnout is more than enough to flip the state.
"And yet the college educated is not, is minimal compared to the college educated in some college."
Kisses.
"The suburbs around Philadelphia have been shifting towards the Democrats in recent years, particularly among college-educated voters and women."
"And in every other state, Kamala Harris has made improvements not only in battleground states, but in safe states, red and blue."
Matt Gorman and Caitlin Huey-Burns are with us now here at the table in Washington.
"He just decided, you know what, I'm going to stop taking questions."
He got a hold of Kamala Harris' medical report on this tweet.
It's not even agreeing on what's happening.
I want to play you some sound that we have of the Arizona Republican Party chair also talking about what's going on here in the state and what gets your thoughts on this on the other side.
"I'm like, I can't even do this."
I'm excited to hear that both of you are voting.
"You know, I mean artwork."
"But if you had Trump's voter base up and you give give all the Haley voters to bite, I'm not sure."
It makes a lot of sense.
"You want to, I think it would, I think it would fundamentally, I mean, you want to talk about what would be something that would make the world burn last minute."
So shout out to the song.
They're doing it right now.
"But but to that point, JD Vance is unpopular, so he doesn't provide a balance to Donald Trump."
Anything at all?
"I think I know some people that are like I personally think he's a terrible person or I'm appalled by some of these things, but I fundamentally think that I'll still vote for him."
"Simply put, no."
She came in for what's called a proffer.
We're going to have the largest deportation in history.
We know it's a red herring.
He never led the polls in really any of these states going back to 2016 or 2020.
My opinion is that the justice system is being weaponized against certain individuals.
Yeah he looks stressed.
I'm saying about these big oil companies and these fossil fuel companies.
They did vote in absentee and mail-in.
In response to recent news coming out about Trump sending Vladimir Putin COVID tests in 2020 during the shortage You posted on X saying that these reports quote would be an electoral game-changer in a normal country What do you mean by this claim in like normal country?
It's like this is an etch a sketch campaign.
"And I have to say, I've noticed this, especially with some men who think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down and acting all pretend tough guy, that somehow that's a sign of strength."
Democrats take them for granted.
I don't think it's decided.
As you can tell I am not a black man.
I just think that it brought people together in 2020.
Here's here's Bucks County at almost 52 percent.
And you deserve it.
What do you think?
Grandma going to have to go back to work.
And what have you seen in terms of demographics and in terms of how people view what goes on in Washington that has changed over the last four years?
She's starting off in Philadelphia and reportedly she will have her running mate with her.
A lot of people talk about the shy Trump voter.
"She's upping her outreach to black men in particular, a key constituency for Harris."
Have you ever heard that?
"Nippon Steel does provide guarantees to support some of those union, or all of them probably that have to do union jobs."
"We've seen it grow just a little bit, but more people seem to be expressing interest from outside of Phoenix online."
"When you have half of your voters vote by mail, like we did in 2020, counting those votes takes time."
Nobody else says that.
Allow me to explain.
The elections were held today.
"She had a video a few months ago saying that Trump was going to be, Trump would be pow pow and that, you know, she was freeing people."
He just can't see them but you have all these balloons up here.
The flip side of it is how humiliating is it that Trump lost to a guy who didn't leave his basement?
And then walk us through how you do it.
"Pennsylvania would win the election for Donald Trump, assuming he gets North Carolina and Georgia."
All the better.
It's definitely not over.
A lot of black males are not into the Harris campaign.
"In fact, the running joke against Democrats is that we're soft."
"And yet when Donald Trump lies or cheats or bullies or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls service members like John McCain losers because they died in battle or were captured, when he calls fellow citizens vermin or the enemy within, people make excuses for it."
"We were the only state to never take the elevated unemployment benefits because I said, listen, Mr. President, our people want to work."
What do you think it means for whether or not he will decide to remove Fawny Willis from this case?
"So I mean, there is a track record, especially on the border."
And I'm wondering what her campaign thinks about it as well.
I think he won.
"And she started going on a rant and he said, ma'am, ma'am, hold on a second."
"So so then what we heard on Jimmy Fallon, she has not changed that position, but then listen to the flip flop."
"My grandmother used to say when I was a little girl, Democrats are for the poor, Republicans are for the rich."
"Trump at 54%, Nikki Haley at 46%, whereas President Biden in Delaware County at 97%, to Dean Phillips at 3%."
"Democrats may be delusional about them, but still, you know, that 70 electoral votes that's already in Donald Trump's column, it's 70 electoral votes that Donald Trump doesn't really have to worry about this election cycle."
Hear me when I say that Donald Trump wants you to have a lousy Christmas.
But I also have all the I have all the voting data for every county in the United States dating back to 1892.
Disappointed.
About how the president's reacting to this in terms of does he believe it's appropriate does he agree with what Governor Shapiro is saying about how this needs to be investigated.
They found the race tide.
"But also, uh, the Harris law's agenda is about, uh, the economy, reducing the cost of living, reducing the cost of prescription drugs, reducing the cost of housing."
"Well, we're told he's going to be crisscrossing the country over the final 27 days of this race, Lana, starting in Pittsburgh, in Pennsylvania on Thursday, the biggest battleground state."
So I want to talk a little bit about that.
"I mean, do you see a strategy to the way he's campaigning?"
Were you involved in any of those discussions?
Both candidates received an equal number of votes in this poll.
"Well, we'll be here breaking it all down every step of the way."
"But now that response bias is starting to tamper down just a little bit, but it's enough for Emerson to find Trump up by a point in Pennsylvania."
"And as long as they know those differences, whether it's on voting rights and democracy or women's rights or workers rights and on big economic issues like tax policy, I think we're going to do OK, but they seem to be unsure of how to how to make the argument."
"I have like, inside information on scrapple."
"Spend time there, amazing people."
She has direction and I think it evens a playing field for the two candidates.
"The tenth poll was conducted by Morning Consult between September 9th and 18 with 1,256 likely voters."
"If you're just joining us, former President Donald Trump has been shot."
"Female, it's gonna be tough on abortion."
That's all.
They get up at the crack of dawn to help us figure out what jacket to wear.
And I did break a taboo and it's kind of a cultic thing.
I really try not to think about the future in politics.
"But still, you know, is it really going to be enough?"
So let's show our appreciation for their unbelievable service to our country.
So this is just another one of those stunts that he will continue on through the campaign.
"Well, look, I think that we're in a better..."
"That is what Trump thinks that we should be doing, encouraging more manufacturing."
Reuben is the kind of person we need in Washington.
"Now, we know this election is going to be tight."
I'll edit it up a little bit.
It could.
"They can't believe that she just, you know, fell out of a coconut tree, as it were, and has nothing to do with Joe Biden, his policies, his results, because she is his number two."
The routine and looking for something new.
"However, this is not the only news we have coming out of Pennsylvania."
"Yeah, I get that."
The audit where the cyber ninjas spent half a year and millions of dollars to examine ballots including their search for bamboo.
It's really hard to say what's really happening here.
So we can talk about the issues.
You can cut the check for Native Americans.
Let's move on to the next topic.
You'll see both candidates in split screen and you'll see what those comparisons are.
One thing you notice when you get here is just the enhanced security.
They gave me the Ave Maria with no voice.
Shapiro is strong.
Is that how this is gonna go?
Is anybody afraid?
"And that that all so that that's confusing in itself and polls always show something different, obviously."
This is a big one.
I don't deny that Pennsylvania will be a close state.
"A month and two weeks ago, CNN was hosting the first presidential debate in Atlanta a month and two weeks ago."
Let's talk about her though.
I can do I can do Waltz.
"It's really, really it's a really, really tight election."
Was told to shut the fuck up and then they finally replaced him.
And I think that's what we're seeing Vice President Harris do.
"It can be really fun and it can be a nice introduction, but I'm not sure that's how we want to receive information about the political candidate we're going to vote for."
"Here we go, everybody."
"If Republicans win in 2024 but not in 2028, will Vance certify the election?"
It was there.
"And so a vote for President Trump is a vote for affordability, prosperity, and the American dream for my generation."
"I paint just for, you know, kind of fun."
"Now the most recent New York Times, Siena poll shows Kamala Harris at 43% of the vote in the Northeast part of the state."
"But also in this situation in Arizona, I mean, again, they had two fake electors slates from two different sets of Republicans in Arizona."
That's a 40 point shift in just four years in Notre Dame.
"We're all watching it, however, because DeSantis is someone that, you know, clearly has ambitions beyond the governorship."
"New York Times, a five point shift towards Trump."
"So who wins, who loses?"
And we see them showing up and voting that way.
We've seen Trump do really well in Pennsylvania.
"Among the things this woman told us is that Joe Biden is actually dead, replaced by a fake."
"And then if you're just joining me here, the reason I did this video is that Kamala Harris got really good polling Quinnipiac swing state polling that she's leading in Pennsylvania, 51, 45 over Trump leading in Michigan, 50 to 45 Wisconsin, according to Quinnipiac is much closer."
How many of you have voted for Donald Trump?
And what does that mean?
"We're like, wait a minute."
"And then the group of insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol, play the clip."
And I have friends.
So I can't explain it.
But you found Harris up by four or five points.
"It's a little weird, if you will, that we're having Northampton only go in the direction of in this case."
And Kamala Harris won't even be getting near in 2024.
"And that message is going to be, get out the vote and get out the vote early."
I'm going to frame it.
Trump has a pretty good shot at winning back some other states.
Democrats gained only 7900 voters.
"Bob, I want you to stand by just for a moment."
Doesn't have a picture of her.
"I mean, he was going out there saying when China succeeds, the US succeeds his entire career."
"We saw the result of that today when our reporter, Jen Fifield, was able to go in."
The winner got 48%.
"Now, yes, Hillary Clinton lost this area by over 4% in the 2016 elections, but in 2012, Barack Obama only lost it by like 1.1%."
They both lie a lot.
"I mean, Amisha Cross is with us as well."
Allentown Mayor Matthew Turk is with us this morning.
I'm undecided So I like to hear both sides of each issues and I I'm open to hearing what President Trump has to say Is there something in particular he could do or say tonight to win you over as a voter?
It's incredible.
"You have a man named Burgum, who's a fantastic governor in North Dakota."
"If she pulls off 43% of the vote in this election, it's over."
"And as Harris gears up for her Fox News appearance, former President Trump intensifying his campaign efforts in key battleground states for their insights into the strategies of the two campaigns."
"So fine, I'm glad she did it."
"That's the scene in Butler County, Pennsylvania where there was to be a marathon rally of former President Trump that only got five minutes in before this incident occurred."
You just got to believe what you want personally at this point.
"We didn't read or report Jen Psaki saying that there would never be a possible situation where something that the president, the previous president did would be entitled to this."
So there's always that element of time.
That's not comfort when I I don't feel comfort when I see Harris winning by a fraction of a point in Wisconsin and Michigan.
Who are the people in America who have the lowest vaccine acceptance rate?
And actually Clinton under Biden under performed Clinton in this county as well.
And these are the people in charge.
"43.49 for Harris, not much different."
"She's joining us live from Washington, DC."
And you have some other results as well.
"If this had been Joe Biden that did that, the Republicans would be screaming up and down that he was in cognitive decline or how dare he say this."
"Your next attorney general, DePasquale, where are you?"
The biggest blow comes from the handling of the Middle East crisis by President Joe Biden's administration.
I understand that fracking has been a large driver of industry in Pennsylvania.
I would think Northampton we have it a little which a ruse scenario.
Trump returns to Harrisburg.
Let's see what else is going on here.

So good for walls.
We're dead.
That was Daniel Mallinson with the with Pennsylvania State University joining us here on NDTV US Election Watch.
But now it's clear that there really isn't any search for Harris and any surge.
That will happen every single day of our administration.

That just means I'll be calling them out even louder.
"And then tremendous doctors in Pennsylvania, local doctors, country doctors that were really they were amazing."
This is a really remarkable turnaround from where Biden was.
Maybe some of them rebounded in 2020.
"For Streaming News Network, I'm Joan Cink."
Wow.
So I'm happy happy story.
"Yeah, what do you make of that?"
"So a boost from Taylor Swift, I would say doesn't hurt."
And so this is it's hard to know how many lessons that we can draw from this.
I can't stand the guy.
People who are not very invested in the election will tend to follow somebody that they trust.

"Anyway, let's talk about, well, Joe Biden being on the campaign trail, what is the point of his presence?"
Can the vice president win this race without this state?
"But they do have a pathway forward with Pennsylvania now, with Tim Walz and Kamala Harris, and that's what the data has proven to us, that even the Republican pollsters, which try really hard to show Donald Trump the advantage point, show Kamala Harris tied and dead even, which is already a massive improvement off of where President Biden was when he was down five points."
"And what we know is that the demographic of these working-class Catholics, you know, they leaned a little bit more Democrat back in the day."
The New York Times reported this weekend that Donald Trump is kind of disoriented by this shift from Biden to Harris.
What's that all about?
The focus groups after the debate were we still didn't hear anything.
Kerry Lake can win by about one.
The treasury candidate remained unapologetic for her comments and doubled down on her thinny veil criticisms of Shapiro in an interview with the New York Post.
It is.

What's the plan there?
"You're a normal lawyer in Pittsburgh here, and I just admire your work so much."
"There have also been some reports that your predecessor, former lieutenant governor and now Senator John Federman expressed concerns about Governor Shapiro to the Harris campaign."

"If you look at the totality of the recent polling, the CBS poll yesterday, the Say 24, Ugov project, and the CNN polls last week, I think you look at them all together, they suggest that Harris is opening kind of sort of a little bit of space in Michigan and Wisconsin, which means, as you've been discussing, if she can add Pennsylvania, she gets to exactly 270."
That's the only blue out there.
"But Donald Trump's promise, and I think his solemn obligation as president of the United States is to fix what Kamala Harris has broken over the last three and a half years."
So I want to say thank you.
The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.

"Hey, this one, Charlemagne is perfect for the job."
"And for the people with Latter Day Saints, and I will say that I think I'm at 88% in terms of level of popularity or whatever you wanna call it."

"But by the way, guys, um, y'all are students."
Thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube.
"He's never going to back down, never going to apologize."
Thursday night a small group of big political players in the Grand Canyon state greeted vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris at Sky Harbor International Airport she didn't address reporters but her supporters said they wouldn't miss the chance to welcome her to Arizona.
I really didn't like his line of questioning.
"Oh, Donald Trump."
"Well Trump had a Pennsylvania rally yesterday and he held up the, not held up, but he had the girl that came out that prepared his big chart that he says saved his life and it was a rip roaring rally and he let come on, there is habit."
"In other words, Americans who don't support him."
"Just like one of your rallies, you know?"
This is a bulldog.
It depends on her audience.
"It would appear that, like, look at the mainstream media, how they talk about it."
"Nobody's trying to have a revolution under your noses But when damn it And this is your man zen master for zen master sports and shorts so in the game game And we'll see you on the next go round Peace Forget the middle weeks Yeah Yo Tune in we're about to get it cracking on gutter cash real stories from the darkest corners Straight from the hoods with crops a daily order Yo, welcome to gutter cash."
He is a dear friend.
"During the course of an interview that covered a wide variety of subjects, the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, provided a comprehensive analysis of the political dynamics that are taking place in his state."
"Saw him here in Erie, Pennsylvania, before."
Now here are some of the names being considered Governor Shapiro Arizona Senator Mark Kelly Minnesota Governor Tim Waltz Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg Kentucky Governor Andy Bashir and Illinois Governor J.
It's the biggest state that in polling is still a toss up.
Tell me what do you mean?
"We had three bulwark events in Philly and Pittsburgh and Detroit, and it was tied to the Republican Voters Against Trump bus tour that was going across the two states between Pennsylvania and Michigan."
"It's just like Virginia to where all the top counties, they're all Republican and Trump is doing very well in Pennsylvania right now."
"Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is gaining momentum in the state, and this might be the defining edge she needs to clinch victory."
"Today with the stock market hitting a new record high, the Harris campaign highlighted a survey of economists in the Wall Street Journal who agreed that Donald Trump's policies would drive up prices, interest rates, and the national debt while hurting manufacturing jobs."
"So how do you see abortion, Ozzy, at this point impacting this race so close to Election Day, if at all?"
Watch this.
She was a popular local news anchor here.
So you really want Donald Trump to win?
"Kamala, you're fired."
I want to know what your thoughts were.
"Both candidates made campaign stops in the keystone state in recent days with Trump swinging by bucks at Lehigh counties and President Biden making a three-day push through PA with stops in Scranton, Philadelphia and in Pittsburgh."
"It doesn't matter if you vote for them or not, like them or not."
People are driving for hours.
"I think when you say she's run a flawless campaign, it's a mistake free one, I guess is a better way."
Can you imagine if Ruben did that right in the middle?
How was it over here?
My name is Marcus.
So let's go to that.
"So we kind of came in thinking we were going to get a good mix of voters, and I think we did that."
"Here's Brett Baer, open call."
I'm just a prosperous person.
Politicians who are willing to work with people on both sides of the aisle to get stuff done and that in this race is Kamala Harris.
Everybody contributes in the way that they do.
But we have the capacity to feed upwards of four to five hundred.
"As you all know, Vice President Kamala Harris has been a huge advocate for the communities across the country to have clean and lead-free drinking water, getting lead pipes removed and replaced, and the remediation of lead paint that still exists in so many homes and nationwide."
And Jeff had just finished his speech and he was coming in there to decompress for a second before he went back out.
That is a very interesting dynamic to watch and whether that gap closes as we get closer.
She also unveiled a new ad that features some of his former national security aides basically saying that so that she it is a notable and more aggressive take from the vice president.
I think that's going to be key for him.
"I mean, she's got years of government experience, far more than Donald Trump."
"So now that Kamala Harris has taken economically populist positions, Trump is defending corporations."
She says that she and her fellow formal observers received no training for what they were to do today beyond being told to watch that the counters were recording the votes accurately.
I know we joke a lot about the size of Trump's crowds and his hands and his everything.
And you're trying to exploit that?
The stock market's had an amazing rally and hit record highs and a lot of people have investments if it's through an IRA or 401k.
"Now I read through this entire report and I can tell you that the rest of it, the depths of it, is really a lot of conspiracy spaghetti thrown up against the wall."
Obviously that is a big part of this conversation nationally.
"Engaging with constituents, addressing their concerns, and promoting clear, actionable plans will be vital in securing voter support.In conclusion, the upcoming elections will not only be a test of the candidate's appeal, but also a reflection of the priorities and values of voters across these crucial states."
"They're going to ask, you know, again, you saw Youngkin talking the other day about Trump's promise to go after Schiff and other radical left the United States with the military."
"There was the best 10 to 12- He got a bill for $35,129 that he refused to pay."
You don't have to like it.
"Please proceed, Mr. Attorney General."
"There were a lot of people there, obviously, a lot of energy around that."
Donald Trump is somebody who says I don't want to take this issue to the national level.
Thank you for watching.
I totally agree.
Limited recent polling shows Harris performing better than Biden versus Trump among Latino voters.
"They offered her the best deal of all, which is dropping the charges again, incredibly rare."
"But McCormick, you look at him, he was trashing Trump in 2021."
Maybe it's because the underlying inflation is causing all of it.
"We know what it is, but it's out of center in northern part of state."
"Adams, who has long been an advocate for digital privacy and cybersecurity, supports Harris' policies on data protection and online security."
He was black.
"Now, wait, hold on a second, because this is a serious piece of business."
"We want to lower immigration, illegal and legal."
"You know, he's going to be inside, but maybe it'll get out there on the interwebs and he'll see it."
You know now that fracking has worked as well as it has there was a point in time at least when Trump was president that we were energy independent.
If this is your first time here guys Please be sure to like comment and subscribe until next time stay barely informed
"Lots of attacks, not much yet on the issues."
"The flip side of sort of the view President Trump delivered on the stump today, Pennsylvania, is President Biden in Ohio."
"So Justin, how about a couple of really beauties and we'll sit down, relax."
Can you talk a little bit more about those poll results?
He's totally lost the thread on that because he just rambled his way out of what he was actually campaigning on.
"If Donald Trump or JD Vance really says something so outrageously offensive, that could drive me to vote for vice president Harris, but it's, it's highly unlikely."
Just get out to the polls on us.
"So the more you look at it, the more it becomes apparent that Trump's in a good position here."
"Millennials, what are the most important issues for you?"
As Cuban Americans make up a significant portion of the Hispanic electorate.
"So, we're currently 29 days away from the 2024 presidential election."
Josh Shapiro has been governor of Pennsylvania for less than two years.
"So my point being, in the unedited portion, she makes a claim about how the administration has handled Israel that I do not think is true."
We told you Harris was a better option.
I want to mention this.
They expect that you have to earn their vote.
That's happening.
"I'm going to go with Insider Advantage because they have good track records, at least better than the New York Times or Quinnipiac, especially Quinnipiac and Bloomberg."
Same thing in the Arizona case.
"As long for free forever, as long as you own a computer that can run it."
But there's also another notion that's going on.
"Jonathan Friedman â€“ $750,000 Jonathan Friedman, an entrepreneur who made his fortune in the tech industry, has been a significant contributor to various democratic campaigns over the years."
"Arizona, the recent poll that came out had him up by five as well in this or they had him up by four, but he leads the average in the state of Arizona by over five points, which is a bigger margin than he wanted by in 2016."
Let me answer it.
"Thank you very much, Josh."
"Obviously when we're looking at the polls at large, everything is very close."
"Can Harris replicate that margin in Montgomery, Chester, Bucks and Delaware?"
"Well, I think it signifies, number one, that the Harris campaign recognizes the importance of this demographic."
"And now, for those who haven't seen it, let's watch the results of the polls, in which Kamala Harris did very well."
"So, you know, you could adjust for the turnout, but just doing that would give Donald Trump the victory."
"I mean, he is speaking to a scary far-right fringe right now and bringing those issues to the debate stage instead of issues that people actually care about."
He's more intelligent than she is.
What took so long?
"He said that's like sinking a two-foot putt, dad."
"He said, at this point, he's just gonna have fun with this year."
"Being able to talk to people in a natural environment, being funny, being relatable, being a man of the people."
That's a really small margin.
"He votes against funding for our roads and bridges, votes against our firefighters, even."
"He says, ""'I think you're cool."
"But no, he came back."
"Why do you think both campaigns, they're kind of ignoring Wisconsin, Nevada, but they're throwing everything at Pennsylvania, Georgia, kind of Arizona, but they're targeting Pennsylvania, Georgia the most because if you win just one of these two states of your Trump, your pathway to winning the presidency is all but secured."
It did in 2020 even in 2022.
So expect those tensions to still be there if Trump is elected but it's certainly a conference much more aligned with his economic message than what we had in a first Trump term.
"As a major energy-producing state, Pennsylvania's economy is deeply tied to the fossil fuel industry, particularly natural gas."
"He's caught, by the way, I hate to say it, he reminds me of myself in these situations because that's the way I would handle it."
Do 24 hours of a show with Kamala Harris?
There's polling out of both of these counties.
I suppose.
"But it is a good indicator, especially if it's like every single update, it's more and more Republican."
"And there may not be a lot of steelworker jobs left in Pennsylvania, but there are enough for President Biden to care about it because, of course, Pennsylvania is a swing state."
"The Harris campaign has been in Georgia, I think three of the last four days."
"If Trump can't deliver us what we want on tax policy, but Harris can potentially with a Republican Senate, that's what we need to be voting for this time so that we can take the presidency back in 28."
"And if after you've gone through that and the folks who are unconvinced say, yeah, I don't know, I still like him, then you then I think you have to then say, yeah, but what about character?"
"If you want to give Republicans zero excuses because you know if you win the election, some Republicans are going to say, oh, it's rigged, this, that, and the other."
There's no denying that there's a new momentum.
It's more of a party that accepts big government in some instances.
This is why she came out after the election when she lost and she never really got over that or admitted it by the way.
"But what we have seen unfold over the last 11 months, the number, the numerous war crimes that have been committed, we have seen a president who has been unwilling to distance himself from the war criminal, Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet."
"So the ads are what we would call softer ads, which is to say introducing the vice president, introducing her policies, not necessarily beating up on her opponent or making some other point."
"And just, we just, we need somebody to get in here and to help the people, you know, and I don't think that that tax proposal is not what the American people, as far as, you know, the millennials and the young generations need at this moment, definitely not."
At least they'll give her some consideration.
You never draw them.
But you have to look at the bigger picture when we're looking at questions of the election integrity across the board.
Pam
So yes for the greater good I am all for what just happened on that stage because we have to think of this shit.
People's wages have seen an increase.
And so that's where they are.
And a brand new formula that drives those dollars out to the districts that need it most.
It was a moment of solidarity and shared purpose.
"But I think Trump is playing very smart politically, saying he's for exceptions, he said they ended the debate."
"In order for people to feel, in order for Democrats to feel comfortable about Bob Casey Jr. beating McCormick in the Pennsylvania Senate race, Democrats need to have banked around 335,000 votes."
" I'm Claude McDaniel, and you're watching Streaming News Network."
"Although Harris is technically ahead, this poll reveals an extremely tight race where Trump's space remains strong and could tip the scales in his favor."
"Caitlin, it sounds like Bob doesn't have the reporting quite hammered out with regard to what role former President Trump plays in this effort to repeal no excuse mail-in voting."
"George Rivera, Jim Vinop, and Angelik Schneider, three voters in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania."
"But one thing we do know is that Nevada as well as Arizona, we're seeing this."
"Now he's in line with, you know, camera."
"What can you tell us about the debate, what we should expect to be watching most closely when he debates tonight?"
"They keep invoking John McCain and a state where people were judged and judged policies and made decisions, didn't vote blindly for anyone."
I don't know why that is.
Our oldest is our daughter.
That is something she said she was in favor of in 2019.
"Zach, what can you tell us about the man who was arrested near a Trump rally near Coachella over the weekend?"
Kamala Harris received 48% of the vote and Donald Trump 49%.
I understand that.
"We've seen crime increase in inner cities in Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh."
"My video this morning I said, I believe Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will win this state by one to two points, but right now, a four point margin isn't far out from where it's closer to be."
"OK, even if that's the case, let's just say fine."
"The senator from Pennsylvania, John Fetterman, warns Democrats that Donald Trump is far more popular in Pennsylvania than they think."
Now we have less than eight months to go and Donald Trump is leading in Pennsylvania.
"where it's you know, this quote says you can't put a singular label on Polish American voters is what Kuzma said, but It does give you a possibility of hey Can you flip voters right as opposed to just boosting turnout because with Haitians you probably aren't gonna like flip all that many votes Just because there's probably not that many Republicans but you know with this one you potentially could actually flip people so it'll be interesting and I Don't know if you can make a good meme of it out at this point But like how massive these sort of the Kamala tent is right now is pretty hilarious So it'd be pretty funny to just kind of be able to look at and see like, okay, where exactly?"
They they have banked one hundred and thirty two thousand votes less than they did in 2020 at this same time.
It took a little while for Kamala Harris to announce her economic policy handbook.
"And we expect that, but it's not, you're not going to make up eight points like that in a state like Arizona, especially with a more favorable environment for Trump in 2024."
"Because Kamala Harris just got a debate prep in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and she greeted voters in the best way possible."
"What's really interesting, it's almost like someone realized banning fracking isn't the best idea when you need those Pennsylvania votes."
But he was rejected even by the other three.
She's doing really well in terms of endorsements from organizations that never endorse presidential candidates.
"Yeah, that case has been embroiled in a lot of controversy with district attorney Fonnie Willis And questions about whether she will even remain on the case as she had a relationship alleged relationship with the prosecutor on the case as well So a few charges dropped on that Trump not commenting on it at this moment He did not mention it yesterday at all, but he does talk often about how his court cases are Quote rigged against him and he believes he will defeat them all so allies I spoke to yesterday on the Trump campaign just kind of shrugged it off and said look it's just part of Kind of what we've been dealing with with these court cases They said that they are confident that Trump will beat all of them and you know We'll be looking to see if any of these court cases really come to fruition and come on the docket before November time is really ticking out especially for Jack Smith in Washington DC, right?"
And that quest continues.
"As a country, we've been through a lot over the last few years."
We still have one more lean state remaining too.
"Yeah, no, you said it wrong."
And I think I said that to James.
And then you get to play those games forever.
Vote for Tim Wols as the next vice president of the United States.
The former first lady has been working behind the scenes to boost Harris and they're expected to have her appear on the campaign trail but it hasn't happened yet.
"As the campaign progresses, these donations will play a crucial role in helping Harris communicate her vision to voters across the nation."
Now Trump is plus three in Pennsylvania and you do have the Senate very close with Casey only up by two over McCormick.
"So alienating local leaders in Philadelphia, it's not a good look for the Harris campaign."
This is Inside the Right.
"One said to another, ""'Pack khaki tan pants."
Why do you think people love Trump?
"I think it's a great question, and that concern is definitely out there."
"Harris may focus on energizing younger voters and minorities, who have historically leaned Democratic but may need additional motivation to turn out in significant numbers."
"If he were to get on message and start campaigning where he needs to, he has some opportunities for growth."
"But we also have to recognize that for young black men in particular, they have had a very difficult time in the last 15 years."
This Republican pollster tells us what we've known for a while.
They both are freaking straight out of central casting for what an assassin of the president looks like.
"In 2016, the Democrats had an advantage of nearly 1 million more Ds than ours."
"And at that point, if he just wins even Nevada, he's got the presidency."
 Welcome back to America Decides.
Remember 2016?
Because here's what happens.
"Remember, the margins here are just so thin when it comes to taking back the majority in the House."
We've got to look out for people who have the legal right to be here.
Yeah this is really it's all about a margins game here.
So what are they doing now to try and fix things?
"She says he should still be president, that Arizona was one of the states that was stolen from Trump in 2020."
We do have a over criminalization of drug crimes in the country.
So let's speak to that.
And yet this is a longtime conservative state here.
"Right now, make sure you enjoy, comment, and subscribe."
It's not even close in 2020 or 2016 in 2020.
"Yeah, so I just want to be clear here that President Trump, more than any political leader of my lifetime, believes in bringing American manufacturing back to the United States of America."
The same thing former President Trump and his supporters are also calling for.
What is the deciding factor for you this November?
For the Trump campaign spokesperson Jamie Flor is telling us the percentage of Hispanics that will vote in November can take the one state to one side or the other.
I agree with you.
I did put in some ads.
The result is an homage to the franchise while simultaneously moving the story for later.
Nothing else matters.
So walk us through how you do it.
"It's like, well, wait a minute."
But I like Donald Trump.
"In 2020, who did you vote for and why?"
One user even said that Obama acted like a black father himself by disappearing for years and only coming back when he had the authority.
"But the 90,000, 50,000, 60,000, 40,000 ballots dropped in Trump's category and then came out verbatim."
"They complain that they've been left out of events, and surrogates haven't even been deployed effectively, and they've urged Harris, in private meetings, to do more to turn out voters of color."
"Pivot to, yeah."
The curator later told the Kansas City Star the whole heist took less than a minute by the time the security guard got back to where those guys had broken in.
You can't let people set the state.
I think it's a little weird if you don't mind me saying it's.
Things are going to change.
"And, you know, it's been a very long time since Arizona has had two Democrats sitting in the U.S. Senate."
So Trump was losing in Ohio and in Florida that night.
"And when you see polls that have them up, it's a good sign."
And I think it's going to be a different presidency.
"There were red hats, there was chanting, there was pointing and booing of the press where we were sitting."
Because the evidence showed that we were innocent.
"All right, Anthony, I've been so curious about what this new polling is finding in Arizona."
You mentioned just how close the last two presidential elections were you wanted in your race in 2022 with the most votes ever for a Pennsylvania statewide candidate.
" Welcome to the Power Shift, where we break down the tectonic shifts of global politics with razor-sharp insight."
Kennedy's comments come after his decision last month to suspend his campaign in battleground states and support Trump.
How was your meeting with Vice President Harris?
"But I want to get into Trump's endorsement passage of him, which honestly made the endorsement worse, in my opinion."
"We're going to drill, baby drill."
"Obviously they're going to have the early vote advantage, especially in a state like Pennsylvania."
I spend more time thinking about the difference between traditional and tomato and basil marinara sauce.
"Donald Trump will more be looking to run up the score, especially in more rural and ex-urban areas in the center of the state."
"But so long as you hold Georgia or flip Georgia, I should say, and then you flip Pennsylvania, you're good."
The potential impacts of Harris's campaign in Pennsylvania extend beyond the immediate electoral outcome.
"Be it Vice President Harris or former President Trump, I want to understand electoral politics that we have at play."
You're not going to see a five to 10 point miss.
The results reflect the will of the voters.
And thank you to your crew as well.
"So according to 538's latest polling average, Casey is up by about five points over McCormick, but over the last two months, that has shrunk from about a nine point lead back in August."
"Maybe maybe Oz and McCormick have annihilated each other enough with enough money that people are like, you know what, this is this is the next generation of Trumpism, whether Trump's with her or not."
Got it.
I like the idea.
Did you have anything else to add?
They're two.
It's a good question.
He said she went from being one of the worst vice presidents in history to Margaret Thatcher.
She has a history.
I appreciate the opportunity to talk.
Or you can go to Rumble if that's your thing too.
He's just bringing up her past statements.
And I get like being newer to politics and hearing people talk about certain things and not knowing what it means.
"Plus, it's me."
I am such a PC.
"And I guess the answer is till it's not, right?"
And abortion is a state issue.
I'm out of here.
We can see it in her own favorability rating numbers.
"Rusty Bowers, what are you talking about?"
"And so that could be a slight headwind for Joe Biden, seeing concerns about Democratic governance among more moderate suburbanites in the Pittsburgh area."
"This abortion access, and I like how they frame abortion access, protecting democracy."
And that's pretty typical there.
They had no October surprise on Trump in 2020.
Now he is here in Pennsylvania over the weekend.
"Biden received 28 percent support among self-identified independents, a figure that rose to 30 percent for Harris."
"And that meant that he would definitely need Pennsylvania, and he looked far away from home in Pennsylvania."
Currently Trump is in the lead.
And how would you describe the Republican Party now?
I know you've been in Arizona for quite some time following what is developing there.
 And former President Trump's stumping in Georgia as the key swing state is shattering its early voting turnout record.
There's no denying that Pennsylvania is the key to this election.
Mm-hmm.
"Oh, excellent."
"We had really, I'll tell you what, that live stream after the debate, we had 50,000 people watch that, which was crazy."
"Again, shaded red."
"Suffolk, a four point shift towards Trump."
"Yo, I love the wordplay on that name."
"But it's all about America first, great schools, good jobs, strong military, growing economy, and pride in our country."
"It's the factory setting is like she reverts whenever she gets a tough question, she reverts back to the factory settings."
There's a lot of questioning as to whether or not she is capable of doing this job.
Even Harris plus five.
"Well, we don't know there Biden's local ties and cultural roots left him to victory in 2020 here But obviously as Democrats battle for the state Kamala Harris is their nominee, you know, she's not a Catholic man she is a California woman of color who is spearheaded post-dab as a porcelain messaging So she's an awkward fit political rights for the state of Pennsylvania, you know have a hard-pressed working-class region That's historically been a locus of anti-abortion activity So I don't know if every like if a majority of voters are actually anti-abortion but again, it's She does remind the voters there of She doesn't Biden reminded them of the older Democrats more focused on economic messages then Kamala who's focused more on abortion and democracy and other stuff like that and Obviously they say here Biden's discomfort we're talking about abortion may have been a Swiss spot modern for the Democrats but Paris by contrast like It's you know For voters that like Northeastern is Pennsylvania Catholics."
That's despite there being three.
"I mean, we effectively have a tide race at this point."
"The Trump camouflage oven mitt, the Trump football flask, the Trump pool float, not intended for use as a flotation device, and the Trump needlepoint flag belt."
"But either way, there's four other polls that dropped that found Trump either slightly ahead or in a statistical tie with Harris."
He's a teacher.
Is that I believe they are yes I mean there are airports out on the west side.
Free healthcare and stopping the genocide in Gaza.
"One issue, if you could nail down one issue that matters to you the most, reproductive rights, climate change, the economy, being pro-life."
"That's why Jesse Jackson, the only guy as far as he did, because they didn't want Jesse Jackson to heart be away from the presidency."
So she went from down to plus five.
So beautiful drawing.
"All they can point to is 2022, which was a midterm year with a different electorate and a lot of pollsters did not wait for it properly by education and across every single party ID or party registration, whether people identified as Republican, Independent or Democrat, you had all of those designations vote a little bit more Democrat."
Excuse me.
"Oh, there certainly is not."
"And it's not just the swing in some of these States like Nevada, but it's more so the swing in the more liberal States."
"They were Karens, you know, we didn't have that term yet of Karens, but they were Karens in 2004."
I think it's the perfect ticket for that.
This is on Tuesday.
There's roads named after him there.
Many of them had assault rifles just out in their hands.
They're wealthy in so many different ways.
We got to focus on our own citizens.
We also know these different kinds of things about what's going on with Kamala Harris being proactive as opposed to reactive.
"The real danger is us as citizens disengaging and thereby elected officials not being held accountable for other bad, unrepresentative acts that they do."
"No, it's not."
Would be an interesting dynamic.
"If you will recall, Donald Trump won all the electoral votes in Pennsylvania in the 2016 US presidential elections by a margin of 0.72 percent."
And no one can answer that question with a yes.
"The one state that has the most electoral votes, the state that if you win, you're probably already winning Wisconsin."
They're trying to make it.
"What does that mean and what do you think is happening here at the intersection of Washington law and policy, which you lived?"
"So, so you heard so you heard his words."
So here's the headline Quinnipiac poll September 18th.
"And while it may not be the margin the Democrats were hoping for with Shapiro, its 19 electoral votes will still end up in the Kamala Harris column."
And she's chosen the person that she believes can help her win this election and that she believes can help her best govern.
But this thing you see with Kamala Harris where she says we're going to hold your government funding hostage unless you agree with our politics.
I got to put in a picture my tip my friend Tom Hagan.
Not one thing.
It was around eight.
And we thought that that would.
All they found was Harris right now at the same time period.
The race is really taking a turn in the days leading up to the election as Robeson's campaign has gained on Kerry Lake.
What is going on?
The eventual winner of these states could very well determine who sits in the White House come January 2025.
"Donald Trump, you think he's a very honest guy?"
This is why Trump needs to come in.
That would be young voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.
And I believe it too.
"And just for the sake of disclosure, we're talking about a poll here, specifically in Pennsylvania, a sample size of a bit more than 1,300 people, a margin of error, 2.7 percentage points, smaller than the rest."
"And it's the big kahuna of the battleground states, 19 electoral votes, that whoever wins Pennsylvania is almost certainly likely to win the election."
He said he was asked by former President Trump and his attorney to call the state legislature back into session and to recall the electors.
"You know, they took it away from him."
"So that's what the buzz is that the way big states, swing states like Pennsylvania, go America will go that way."
"In the show's part two that premiered early this year, Morelos got to display her singing talent for the first time in the series."
"It's just so close, but this is North Carolina and Georgia are both very important that they are very important."
I know the polls didn't have him up by like three to four and I'm not even saying he's going to win the state by this margin.
"So I want to start off with a little bit of breaking news here, and that is that Donald Trump, who frames himself as the leader of the party of the military, he was just rebuked by the army, an almost unprecedented rebuke here by the US army, after an altercation broke out at Arlington because he was trying to use his visit there as a photo op and there was some shoving that ensued."
So that was the power of abortion at that time.

So we're seeing this process play out.
"Starting in the Midwest with Iowa and Ohio, two states clearly likely to vote for the former president for a third time, we are going to, in both 2016 and 2020, he prevailed both of them by 8 to 10 points."

"So with election rallies in the last phase, Donald Trump has proposed ending US income taxes for Americans who live abroad as part of his 2024 presidential campaign."
Let's see what she says.
"Biden's ratings are very, very low."
"He addressed crowds of supporters during this event dubbed the, quote, rally for election integrity."
You were in this very unique position where there aren't other reporters being allowed in to watch this.

"She'll give first-time homebuyers up to $25,000 to help them with a down payment."
Final question.

They can do it.
"The popular vote was closer in 2016, the polls."
"Even at one point, Casey was saying, you know, you even claim that you grew up as a farmer and then that's not even true."

"Yeah, so I agree with Schmidt that it's dangerous."
They don't frequent the national electorate or the statewide electorate.
Donald Trump is perplexed by the concept that two weeks ago he was talking about President Biden and now he's talking about Vice President Kamala Harris.
It's an open primary in the state of Indiana.
"But they only won for Vice President, former Vice President, now President Joe Biden, won that county by only 4%."

I can't even get it out.
"The three states to keep an eye on out of this are North Carolina, where Harris has a narrow lead over Trump by about two points, and then, of course, Arizona, where Harris is up by five, that New York Times-Ciena College poll shows, and then Nevada, where it's got Trump up by a few points."
That's something that we've also seen.

"Now while Trump is on the other side of the state, Harris is focusing on Erie County, as we said, this bellwether area, trying to win the state's 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state."
His campaigns messaging around restoring order and promoting economic growth could resonate well in these demographics.
So who knows what they're going to do.
"No question about it, Ben."

You understand me?
See the problem is in Washington everybody's looking out for their jobs So everybody in power in the administration other than Joe Biden is still in They're all still fighting for their jobs So that administration is going to leverage all of its executive power To try to prevent anybody else from interrupting Because their jobs are on the line Not just Kamala Harris but everybody in the Biden administration that she might replace Or that anyone might replace Right so Gretchen Whitmer comes along He says no I want my own staff I want my own XYZ of course the cabinet We don't know what would Kamala Harris change Biden's cabinet We don't know Would Gretchen Whitmer with any of them or would they say hey we're going to continue on with this administration regardless of whom you choose to be president I mean if that's the case it's all about identity politics If it's not about agenda what else is it about And the Democrats better come up with an agenda quick Because nobody knows what the hell they're trying to do Nobody knows what they want to do Nobody what you tell me folks what do the Democrats want to do?

It's very interesting.
Are you ready to do that?
He was a great man.

Kamala Harris received 46% of the vote and Donald Trump 48%.
What's happening after the striking down of Roe versus Wade is that both parties realize that that their extremes are where the country is.
It's yet and it really just comes down to turn out at the end of the day.
But we're going to get to that.
So I have so many questions.
"Well, let's be clear."
So Donald Trump has finally made an endorsement in Pennsylvania for the Senate race and he has endorsed none other than Dr. Oz.
"What do you think also of my, where's that over there?"
Biden's at 45 in the five way race when they pulled it.
Both sides are trying to court key activists and officials in Pennsylvania.
Nicole Killian and all the voters thank you very much for your time.
Why is that important to you?
But the biggest shifts came mostly in the Scranton area.
What are you doing?
"I think one of the issues that really resonates in the Philadelphia suburbs, which taken a lot of you kind of think of the suburbs as a city, it's bigger than Philadelphia, just to give your viewers and your listeners a sense of how important it is."

"Both VP Harris and former President Donald Trump have really been riding off a new wave of momentum now, zeroing in on these battleground states such as North Carolina, hoping that we're going to take the ticket."
"She's in Erie, Pennsylvania tonight."
But ideally we know real real clear politics is already having a Trump win.
"Asking black men to accept the entry of women, particularly women of color, in corridors of power Barack Obama's words managed to touch a raw nerve."
"The fact that Biden was able to win Michigan by—well, in, you know, 150,000 votes, not huge, given you're talking about millions of voters, was part of the reason that he is president now."
"So people would look up here and say, well, you know, eight years ago, Hillary Clinton was up three points."
"And her approval rating is going back down basically even with Trump, which would be a death sentence for her campaign."

"I don't know I'll just say this I don't I don't want to know politicians I don't want to have their phone numbers I don't want to be friends with them because if they have to come on this show, I'm not bringing friends on my show I don't want to do that."
"It's ridiculous, actually, if you're refusing to front the press or even start to at least outline some of your policies."

"But you heard him he's uh Commenting on how it's the internet people think everything's fake Especially of course a big incident like this going down, but there's so many situations, you know I could give a million examples of stuff that people don't believe is real or whatever No comment and let me know your thoughts But you heard him he said that he told him totally believes that trump would indeed Put together a whole play like that to win the election, but he doesn't believe that's what happened But he does believe at this point Um, you know after those events today that there's no way that trump doesn't win the election and I gotta say my reaction right at this moment, man And again, I always gotta make it clear when i'm speaking on anything political I'm not like this side that side type of guy or anything."
"Again, you have one out of Rasmussen."
The state's high court rejected a challenge by Dems to remove the requirement that mail-in ballots be dated so they didn't want there to be a requirement that you had to date mail-in ballots to get them in by a certain time.
"Now, some people might claim, well, this is just the polling in Pennsylvania."
I'm a lawyer.

It's all programming.
"They don't want to talk about continuing the tax cuts for the billionaires, the wealthiest people in the world and the biggest corporations in the world, because they know that if they talk about that stuff, they're going to lose a lot of votes."
"So anyway, love you guys."
Adrian Fantes is the Democratic Secretary of State of Arizona.
What have you found?
He should be condemning this.
I don't You know people make everything about Trump supporters seem horrible and bad.
Democrats criticized him for it.
I think Josh Shapiro easily has the kind of pull where he can carry a state for for Kamala Harris.
"It's all about what happened here at Butler, Pennsylvania on J13."
"And again, for the fourth week in a row, Donald Trump is beating Kamala Harris by two points, 49 percent to 47 percent."

And so I want to talk about exactly that.
We're forced to provide full coverage right here on ABC News Live all day long.
"It's like she's absolutely capable to to have that message But what I'm committed to doing is I'm going to keep showing up and letting people understand that it's like hey You know I I stand with with the vice president just like I stood with with Joe Biden throughout all of this and I believe that Kamala Harris is going to prevail on this I really want people to understand I don't have anything different to say between now and 2016 that We all have to understand that it's going to be incredibly close and all of the things that's happened and all the Scandals and everything that hasn't that hasn't have any impact on Trump and here's where we are And now let's just hold hold the line between now and November And it's going to be very close and I do believe we are going to prevail in all of these things is it a pro-democracy Message freedom message is it an economic message that will win, Pennsylvania I know you don't want to give her advice, but you know the state well."
"And there's a quite a there's a lot of votes in the Allegheny County is Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas, the uninitiated here."

"So that means less voters for Donald Trump, more voters overall, that's going to add to the overall number."
"JD Vance and Donald Trump, on the other hand, really aren't."
Let me reframe the question.
"It's a lot of what I love doing is I love helping companies become successful, which is why this election is so important to me and to all of us."
What's the latest there?
Maybe Republicans are just more reliant on early voting.
Well guess what?
"Now, again, to be clear, there is no evidence as of this moment of voter fraud in the state of Nevada."
And I've always wanted to work at McDonald's.
Let's talk about the Asian community.

He's totally discombobulated.
"I shared a part one of what people were saying yesterday, and I saw comments of people saying to share more."
"They shifted a portion of them down to Maryland, but the majority of them were lost and gone for good."
"Zooming out, Harris has a slight edge nationally."
It's kind of a thing.
It's correctly called the next president three out of four times since 2008.
It's covered up by the machines.
"And obviously, 2020 was a pandemic year."
Is Harris going to do as well as Biden did in those places?
I'm sure a man who is gonna ask him about it when he goes up to the Hill.
So these are really good numbers.
I have never been more disgusted as a single party.
"You could do whatever you want with limitations of, you know, not harming people or not like offending children or being disgusting in that way."
So Donald Trump is a two-point lead in the states that actually matter.
It's of course now mid-July and they're still going strong.
There are really two or three trends that a lot of people here will point to as major shifts in the state that probably contributed to the wins.
They will be in a few weeks That's important to note But Trump is making the claim that look the voters already know the issues They already know the candidates Why bother but yesterday vice president Kamala Harris in Greensboro said we actually owe it to the voters to do a second debate for them to see Kind of how Trump and I are interacting on the stage what policy differences we have and how they would impact those voters So remains to be seen whether we will see these two candidates on the debate stage again as as of this moment Donald Trump is ruling it out But CBS News proposed a debate yesterday with our partners at Univision and Wall Street Journal So we welcome them anytime to come on and talk about it.
"Minister, Minister Obama right there, boys."
"And then he just kind of said, oh, actually, it wasn't true."
"And Hunter, you know, as you know, this is someone who's also been criticized for how he handled the George Floyd protests, with some people saying that he should have activated the National Guard sooner."
"He's good on public education, which is an issue that's important to me."
What are you hoping to hear from Trump in Tuesday's debate?
"I mean, they're really leaning into the she needs to be introducing herself to the American people."
"Thank you very much indeed, Ms. Liblong, for joining us and getting us that perspective there."
"I mean, they are looking at numbers that show them in a really, really strong position, a really, really strong position against Donald Trump, in contrast with what we had seen previously."
"And in this case, 75,000."
"She's been clean and sober for 10 years, ladies and gentlemen."
They tend to be slightly more male and they tend to be more likely to be voters of color.
I put my name on it to make money off licensing my name.
"This is part of a swing that Donald Trump did last week, including speaking to law enforcement members and doing a town hall with Sean Hannity in Pennsylvania, a state that the Trump campaign has repeatedly made an emphasis and focus as they head towards November."
"And even they are saying, it didn't matter one way or another."
You can't let them do it because I didn't realize you were so dependent.
"That working class majority minority base of voters has been a key focus in the middle of this pandemic for the Democratic party, as they were concerned that many of these voters would either have left the state or would have gone somewhere else or just wouldn't have the time to cast their ballots."
"Now it's burned to a crisp, but they landed."
"Pennsylvania, they passed a law that they couldn't count them until election day."
"They are actually, look, they're doing it as we speak."
"Haha, that was a great one buddy."
You really care about me even though.
"We know there's a lot of Catholics in Eastern Pennsylvania, a lot of Polish American voters."
"This is the Suffolk University poll, which again, number one rated in all of the 2021, 2022 polling."
That's a this year.
"In 2016, he only got 45.9% of the popular voters, somewhere in that range."
He'll be going to this next event in your hometown.
"So talk to your friends, your family, your coworkers, whoever, have those conversations, but listen to each other."
I can't even get by here.
Sorry for the confusion.
"Or do you think that he should have endorsed one of the lesser known candidates, whether it would be Gale or Barnett or whoever?"
"And JP and I talked about, and she raised the fact that Trump has literally said that if he is not elected, US democracy itself will end."
That's what the individual looks like.
That resonates here.
This time it is in his telling there has already been an invasion and he needs to the country needs to weed these people out and using his own words.
And he had a career of doing that.
Trump's averages in the state seem to have solidified in Georgia slightly ahead of North Carolina and Arizona which would put him at about 262 electoral votes but still shy of of course what he would need.
I was not.
"And so, you know, look share this network share this video."
Fair enough.
"This is a good poll for Donald Trump because if that's the average in those battleground states, that means that Donald Trump is probably going to end up winning the election, especially given the top line nationally."
It was his first event in the Keystone State since the assassination attempt on July 13.
And I think that showed the Democratic Party that there's a pathway to victory through Gen Z.
"It's no, he can afford to lose."
Trump plus point four point six.
It's very important that we show you what's happening outside of the Maricopa election center right now.
"We don't really, it's not."
"And yet, when Donald Trump lies or cheats or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls POWs losers or fellow citizens vermin, people make excuses for it."
"A recent Emerson College poll from October 1, 2024, had both candidates at 48 percent, while a Bloomberg-Sawanar Morning Consult poll found Harris ahead by 5 points."
But this rural community appreciates when people respect them and they show up in their neighborhoods.
The conflict of interest is oh so clearly evident in Burnovich's latest fundraising plea.
"But another race where you had a blind spot was North Dakota, where you did see Rick Becker, who was just objectively the America first anti-establishment candidate, even pro-Trump candidate."
So maybe there still is a chance that these states do get called at around two or three a.m.
I understand it's important to some folks.
I've tried so hard to be tolerant.
You can't just say it's false because you don't like it.
"The difference in the national at the national level with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, and even in races like mine or congressional races, people know there's a basic difference between the two candidates."
"See, I don't operate like that."
But here we are.
"The statistical tie with Fox News, Sussacwon, Rasmussen, Mollenburg, Marist, et cetera."
I will share my screen with you guys at some point.
"We know it, and they know it."
I know that you are in sometimes what's a really uncomfortable position out there with all those people being really agro with you.
We're your people.
And so he's talking about Harris's record in the White House and the Biden-Harris record of trying to stop the use of fossil fuels and how that's associated with higher energy prices.
But who can deny the results?
"Nevertheless, it just shows that Biden is in a big, big tough spot."
"They're not trying to hear, you know, how do you take America back decades ago?"
We're now going to dive into it and what it means.
Am I saying he's going to win the state by three?
"So almost a month ago, she's actually higher."
"She is a United States Senator, significant consequence."
"These poor, all these poor local weather people, haven't they been through enough?"
"He's an incumbent Senator, so it makes sense that a lot of Pennsylvanians know who he is."
"We have to assume that because we know with Pennsylvania polling in October, there can be huge misses."
"If we have this sort of equivalent of Kobe Bryant or Steph Curry or LeBron or something like that, they want to join the team."
"You know, like people can use artwork to wake the world up."
You saw them gain over the past week.
"And by the way, I have to say thank you for putting people from Bucks County on TV."
"By six point three, Wisconsin was meant to be assigned to Biden."
"I don't know how to tell you this, man."
So that it is a notable and more aggressive take from the vice president.
They're threatened constantly.
And I know this is more liberal leaning.
But let's get one thing out of the way quickly.
"These people, 46 percent of MSNBC watchers say protecting our democracy and twenty eight percent say abortion rights for a pretty massive combined total of seventy four percent."
"Well, based on this article, there are definitely some doubts."
92 comes along.
"Register voters, get them out to vote."
These razor thin margins are why broadcast networks around the world consider us a swing state.
"So Jason, of course, they make a lot of things here."
"Well, certainly if the G7 was any indication, he will be wandering off and staring blankly into the distance."
"For all of the working people struggling under Kamala's inflation nightmare, we will have large tax cuts for workers."
"There are some jurisdictions in the country where non-citizens are allowed to vote in certain local jurisdictions, but they're not permitted to vote in federal elections, and it's not really a thing."
Good afternoon to you everyone.
It says it's designed to make it easier for people who support Mr. Trump to volunteer to help his campaign.
He's not even giving us a choice.
"She sort of stepped up, you know, she's always sort of for months, she has been arguing that former President Trump is unfit."
" Guys, some breaking news here."
You could find out more about Senator Casey at bobkacy.com.
"This time, Congress will have the full weight of the federal government behind its security, including more officers on the ground and technology to detect potential material used in weapons of mass destruction."
Brett tends to be tough on Trump.
Pennsylvania is a battleground state.
Nice.
"Guess they saying another violent Democrat tries to attack Trump, you know, it is rallying in Pennsylvania, which is the secret service Now where is the Secret Service There is a secret service I seen someone exit said why do Trump supporters cheer on?"
So Georgia and Pennsylvania really are gonna be the two states everyone's focusing in and we've seen a lot of poll movement there in the last couple of weeks.
"I mean, since we've seen the debate, which was actually just less than two months ago, a month and a half ago, even prior to that, we saw that Joe Biden was starting to drop in the polls, starting to drop in support, the uncommitted vote started to get higher, the amount of democratic sentiment that was pushing away from the party was getting higher."
Thank you so much for joining us again.
He wants to keep a line between the White House and any matter with the Department of Justice or any local jurisdiction.
"And remember, Joe Biden had home field advantage here on paper, like he's Scranton Joe."
 US What's up YouTube this is 2raw4TV.
"You know, former President Trump's got the rallies and he's got the microphone and he's got the audiences and he can spread his message to thousands if not millions of people."
"Now, that those are just some elements of your GSD agenda."
"And one thing too, and we'll talk about this tomorrow, is that in this poll, they also polled the Senate races."
There's been no correction.
I wanted to shake up the dynamics in our in our valley.
I'm here because this is history.
"Jureka, great to be with you."
"Well, look, I think if you look at the people lining up to be surrogates for Kamala Harris, it's far more plentiful."
"So a lot of these bills didn't pass, but there were a number of them out there."
She's saying we have not done everything we need to.
You've got a good breakfast here in front of you I think some French toast and some bacon.
You haven't seen anything yet.
And the messaging is on Trump's side.
"And he was grumpy, he was grousing, you still see it poke through every once in a while."
And she won't explain it because she has no idea what she's saying.
There are no county officials around.
"Yeah, look, I think overall Pennsylvania is a big industrial state."
"They have outsourced the whole thing to these private contractors who have our records, who have our ballots."
"Well, you're losing Pennsylvania and therefore Trump's pathway to winning is all but secured."
"Politics, essentially."
"For four straight years, Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails and insane asylums and the worst mental institutions anywhere in the world, not South America, all over the world."
"But it doesn't really matter if Republicans are sitting plus one in terms of this, what Gallup is doing in their survey, because Gallup has always been right the past five elections in terms of party ID survey, which is what they do and the actual popular vote number being within one point."
"First up, the University of Massachusetts Lowell poll conducted between September 11th and 19th."
"So the economy has been a tough sell for President Biden throughout this campaign, as you well know, is his campaign advisers point to metrics and say, look, things are actually going pretty well."
"In the edited version, she responds swiftly and is not seen to make that claim."
"We got some memes, extra salty."
Casey's been in the Senate a long time since 2007 and McCormick made the most of that.
And so their resources in some cases have gone to Kathy Barnett and McCormick.
These are two shit pollsters that have long histories of overstating Democrat support.
That very same clip unearthed and broadcast by Fox News is now making waves on social media.
"And by the way, also terrible staff work."
And that is why Trump's going on these podcasts.
There's these marginal voters who may or may not show up.
"Harris is likely to win Philadelphia and some of those suburbs, and also Pittsburgh, perhaps, but the very far outer rings, that's where she's less likely to do well."
"And I'm Troy Hayden and for Mark Tonight, Arizona voters were anxious to get their early ballots for this big November election and now almost halfway through this early voting period we are getting some results."
"Look, I understand the former president is desperately trying to stop this bill because it's not he's not interested in solving the border problem."
This was two weeks and they were off by six.
"Because again, whether you look at our polls or others, you know, we could run the same poll and show Harris maybe even or plus one."
Make sure you follow me on x links.
"Yeah, I think this is just one of those problems where I don't think we're going to have as big of an aberration as we did in 2016."
We can't do it without civilians and civilians can't do it without military.
They highlight this meeting that Harris's campaign had with Latino leaders.
Maybe you're sick.
"Gotti, have the people who are there, you described it about 200 people, have they been trying to get in?"
What gives?
"All that, peace."
"Three big outliers of Harris plus two, Harris plus three, and of course, Bloomberg with Harris plus five."
So I don't know what your two what your the impressions are for either of you about the state of polling.
Did anybody see the Bryson D'Chambeau thing?
Will he count the votes for the Democratic candidate that won or will he not?
"Bill Salmon, my boss, led it."
The higher rates they will vote on Election Day.
There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking.
"I think that the Arizona primary here says a lot about where at least Arizona Republican voters, what their takeaways are when not only January 6 public hearings, but what they want their party to look like into the future."
Not every Arizona Republican is voting red for the next president.
He has a lead in Arizona.
"Now, he's obviously been in Pennsylvania a lot and Trump is somewhat kind of omnipresent and he's never off your TV."
"Well, at the rally today, Elon Musk is expected to be there."
I just don't feel like doing it right now.
I don't wanna be talking about this.
"And as you know, they voted the same way in every presidential elections since 1871."
"Yeah, yeah, I hear that."
But people are out there and voting and Republicans have a sizable advantage.
"And again, these are huge numbers that really could decide Pennsylvania and the election."
"And Pennsylvania, Dr. Oz is the only one who can win because he was successful on TV and was popular, respected and smart."
"He was the one who brought attention to the behavior of Jeff Duncan, a former lieutenant governor of Georgia, who was a Republican and who went against the grain of his party in order to endorse Harris."
So Gary who's with you and what are they saying about the speech?
"I don't I don't wish this kind of crap on Biden and his family, even though I believe they are criminals that have taken advantage of the country."
"All right, Asma and Mary Alice Parkes, thank you so much."
I think the bigger problem are the people from within.
You know that's their biggest resource on these areas that they won't win.
Is he our pet?
"And then the editing, of course, for both sides, I think nobody was really happy."
"You know, I've been proud to be endorsed by firefighter unions in my campaigns."
"But even then when you average it all out, Trump has retaken the lead in Pennsylvania for the first time since August or actually the end of August."
Biden was up by four.
I don't know if you've talked to the Harris campaign about this or if they've reached out to you.
"specifically what's Western, Pennsylvania Well, I think really it's I you know back in 2016 I dressed like a slob and I didn't have any hair and I've been saying this is gonna be really close It's gonna be incredibly close when it was the secretary Clinton and here we are in 2024 and I still dress like a slob I don't have any hair and it's gonna be very close right now too because it's a very stark choice here and there and And now I do believe Kamala Harris is going to prevail on that but we must we can't forget that Trump has an appeal in Pennsylvania and we need to make sure we show up everywhere and we need to come at them and Make the argument and a lot of the kinds of rooms that other times people aren't even going to showing up and that's what I've been Doing and that's what I'm going to be doing between now until the election right now And but people understand who Trump is and I don't know why some people might have that kind of appeal But after everything that we've done and what has happened whether it's the trail or whether it's the impeachment or whether it's what to do impeachment or January 6 or even after the assassination attempt all of those kinds of things I'm not really convinced that this debate's gonna change and then a significant kinds of way Well, I wonder I wonder if there is a way to change it you say people know who Donald Trump is."
I watched Tim Scott on television yesterday.
The series of explosive noises shuttered through this crowd.
How many cookies do you expect to sell this year?
"However, in 2016, Pennsylvania flipped red, with Trump securing a narrow victory of less than one percent, making it one of the key states that handed him the White House.IN 2020, Pennsylvania flipped back to the Democrats, with Joe Biden winning the state by just over one percent."
A few things I'm going to ask you for.
And that's why you saw a bunch of New York Republicans vote against the bill at the time.
"We saw it when no matter the race of the individual who he's talking about, if he doesn't have a substantive message, he starts to go personal."

We're very much very much aligned.
Maybe she's wrong.
I think we really have to get control of the media.
"And so what actually ended up happening like in the state of Arizona, Arizona for example, we read about right, or maybe it was Georgia, I think it was Arizona though, but he had these electors who were signed up to vote for him."
Where would you rate yourself?
"And I think maybe I'll have to take some to Kamala Harris for every time she does a softball interview, she wants to wear some body armor."
So I think that a lot of people are reading into this type of stuff way too much and that's the way it is.
We are trying to find out.
"Looking at the graph, we can see that it is a highly contested battle between Harris and Trump."

"Because when they take a look at the lead for Trump over Harris, even according to real politics, when you take a look at where it is, when you're looking at just the 538 averages here, they are far, far, far better."

There was the smile and the laugh.
So you have this map here.
And it is really hard to see.
"And in the Republican primary, it seems to carry you pretty far by all accounts."

We're not reinventing it.
"Furthermore, given how much polls exaggerate Democratic support, Harris truly has no chance in the real elections if she cannot even lead here."
"Okay, so I gave you all the data right there."
"Blake, a quiet but influential figure in Pennsylvania's wealthiest circles, has donated $500,000 to Kamala Harris' campaign."
Should he be able to sustain this momentum?
"That statement by the former president, that one and the one preceding it, should be categorically condemned."
There's no question.
"And it kind of seems like Abbott went one step further and said, you know, essentially these are already underway."
But that's not the whole story because Democrats absolutely positively need that floor in 2020 of those mail in ballots in order for when they barely won with the floor as it was in 2020.
I get it.

Watch out.

A judge has found Lisa Snyder guilty of two counts of first degree murder among other charges and rejected the defense's attempt to claim Snyder was not guilty by reason of insanity.
"And so we were like, I wonder if we could get her."
"Even then, do you really think Michigan is going to vote like four to five points to the left of Pennsylvania?"
The ability to achieve such victories can be used to build a narrative of strength and effectiveness.
And what would you do with them if you would revoke them or not?
I'm excited to see Kamala Harris continue that and take that campaign to western Pennsylvania.
"Looking at some polling that came out this week from Quinnipiac University, looking at likely voters in Pennsylvania, Harris is up by three points, so there's some work for him to do there, Gio."
But were Harris to lose in November?
That dust up in court today was not for nothing.
"If they're concerned about issues like immigration, ask him, well, what do you think he's going to do?"
"And it came across as though labor was behind her, right?"
How?

"I, with my husband Brian, own and operate a direct-to-consumer on-the-farm market, featuring beef that has been raised on the family farm in Donegal, PA. We procure lamb, chicken, and pork from other small farms in Pennsylvania like ours, and all the animals are harvested through local processors to our specifications."
Does she need to introduce that to voters?
"And that's where I think you see a stark contrast, right?"
The president is okay.
Is it going to be Maga Republicans?
So I did previously report on how Kamala Harris is actually already gearing up for a legal battle for the election results after.
"It's a huge industry, but it's not just the present jobs, it's the future jobs."

"He has a golf course in Palos Verdes, not far from here, and also to Trump Tower in New York, where many of the items for sale, the Trump items, are made in, guess where?"
"Made you stop the traditional reporting in a nonpartisan manner and sort of turned towards opinion Oh, yeah, that's a good question."
We knew that was going to come.
The Pennsylvania ruling can serve as a strategic talking point in debates and public appearances.
" all right so Kamala Harris had a sit-down interview with a local station and they asked her about her economic plan and she basically repeated the same thing that she always says the interviewer wanted to get some details on her economic plan so she says that well I'm from the middle class and blah blah blah blah opportunity economy blah blah blah blah I was gonna actually react to it right here but I'm just so sick of her saying the exact same thing it's ridiculous it's pretty pathetic at this point she's gonna give $25,000 new homeowner home buyers which makes those first of all where's this tax credit gonna come from where are they gonna find the money for all this and even if they do okay let's say you give away $25,000 to somebody who's looking to buy a home or whatever okay well then if you're selling a home if you're selling a home naturally you're gonna raise the price of the home by $25,000 because you now know that this person has access to $25,000 from the government anyway she says she wants to build 3,000 new homes or apartments or whatever okay yeah how are you actually gonna do that you know it's just really embarrassing at this point she can only perform on a really controlled environments which made the debate really frustrating obviously the moderators supported her as much as they could attack Trump as much as they could Trump's still fail to just expose her but I'm not gonna dwell on that we still have a little more time to go in this campaign and it's pretty obvious that she has nothing new to offer as far as a plan she just repeats what she's been coached to say and that's all we're really dealing with here so she gets into the White House who's actually gonna be running the show seriously but she have any ability to actually do this job she talked about her economic plan she has no experience whatsoever running large organizations companies corporations or anything governments even she was an attorney attorney general of California prosecutor in San Francisco she became a US senator but I mean where's a real practical experience actually running large organizations the answer is she doesn't have any and she doesn't really need any because she's not gonna be running this show so there you go thanks for watching thanks for listening and don't forget the future belongs those who bear for today and speaking of the election there has been some good news as far as the election is not all gloom and doom as far as World War three and all this other stuff there are has been a ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and it's really good news for Trump essentially they're saying that mail-in ballots without correct dates will not be counted so you can't be submitting mail-in ballots without the right dates so some good news right there they have to have some type of standards put in place and let me say this one more time about elections you cannot have a situation where it takes three days to count the damn votes the system loses all credibility system loses all credibility when that happens and going back to the world situation with Ukraine the problem with the Ukraine using long range missiles given to them by the US and UK is that they need satellite satellite technology they don't have the technology and expertise actually utilize these long range missiles without direct involvement from NATO that means the United States means to UK and if they're in a situation where they're they get to okay from the United States and UK NATO to actually use these long range missiles in Russia Russia's there Putin is saying that it means that Russia is gonna be a war with NATO now what does that really mean does that mean they're gonna the Russian Navy is gonna take on the US Navy the US has the best Navy I say that much it doesn't mean nuclear weapons is I mean tactical weapon tactical tactical nukes been used throughout Europe what does that really mean that's the question I do know this Putin has set red lines before and they don't has crossed them over and over again so at this point does anybody in London and Washington really take Russia seriously do they take Putin seriously now right now the Washington is sort of pulling back with this idea we've seen this in the past where somebody in Europe or suggest a let's do cross this red line and Washington says well I don't know about that but then later on it come around say well okay go ahead and do it we've seen this pattern play out over and over and now Putin is saying that a if you cross this red line we know we will consider NATO to be directly involved in this conflict what is it what what what exactly will be the consequences what is Russia gonna do I mean that's the big question there's talk that maybe Russia can do a demonstration of a nuclear test they haven't done that since 1990 I don't think that's gonna be effective in deterring NATO because at this point a lot of people in NATO believe that a Russia is gonna do anything all right this is to say the world we have a presidential election where it's pretty obvious that we're in big trouble we're in very big trouble that's if we don't end up in World War three before then so do your best to take care of yourself take care of your family I wanted to range today enjoy that and I'll forget the future belongs to those who prepare for today"

 here is showing a narrow two-point lead over former president Donald Trump that is well within the margin of error our political editor Dennis Welch is here now to break down those numbers yeah and when you say within the margin of error what you're basically saying statistically it's a dead heat now Arizona's family commissioned the survey in partnership with the local public affairs firm high ground and it reaffirms what we've been seeing so far that Arizona's 11 electoral college votes which could determine who wins the White House are still very much in play for both candidates here are the top line numbers they reveal Harris leading Trump 47 percent to 45 the results also reveal that 45 percent of those surveyed say they've already made up their mind to vote for Harris while 41 percent say they will definitely be voting for Trump I think one of the biggest takeaways here is that the race is very close and getting closer we've seen some surveys where Trump has a narrow lead we've seen others where Harris has a slight lead all of them have been within the margin of error Paul Bents is the longtime Arizona pollster who conducted the survey commissioned by Arizona's family his data reveals that Harris is doing a better job convincing voters to cross party lines at this point the vice president has convinced more than 12 percent of likely Republican voters to support her on the other hand Trump has only managed to convince 1.7 percent of Democratic voters to back his candidacy the two candidates are also evenly split with voters who are unaffiliated with any party while Trump is leading by double digits with independence what we're really seeing is that the Democrats are much more solidified behind their candidate they very much circled the wagons whereas Republicans are still struggling internally with at least a portion of their party Harris is also doing better than expected with voters 65 years and older the two candidates are evenly split at 48% among this reliably Republican block and like the previous two presidential cycles Trump is doing much better in rural parts of the state than Harris while the VP leads in Arizona's two most populous counties Maricopa and Pima and this survey was conducted at the end of last week another interesting data point here is the gender gap with Harris winning more than 52 percent of female voters to Trump's 40 percent while Trump is winning over 50 percent of male voters to Harris's 42 percent yes we've been saying for a long time it's going to come down to a couple hundred thousand voters in seven swing states of course Arizona very pivotal and the last presidential race was decided by like ten point five thousand here in Arizona yeah and if you look at the data here maybe it's not surprising but 86 percent are pretty much made up there they're locked in so 14 percent out there maybe maybe could be moving movable but you know it's going to be very close we knew that I know the election is a little over a month away but remember early voting starts next week so we're already in the middle of this and Dennis these were a likely voters not just registered voters yeah these were picked by basically on how often they vote these are people who are reliable voters out there they wanted to get a sense of who were they supporting how are they voting what's going to happen with them now that does leave open some room could there be an influx of new voters out there have Republicans identified voters who haven't typically voted in the last election cycle the last couple could Democrats do the same thing there's always a lot of questions to be answered well with these polls there's always things you can look at with a little suspicion just like every poll but as politicians have told me for years decades now the only poll that matters is in November yeah take a good thing they call this a snapshot in time which is what it is we like it it's interesting to see the breakdown Dennis thank you

Cory was a great person.

The good news is that Trump has managed to convince more Republicans to do this.
"And then out of nowhere, like Pixie dust, oh my God, now she's likable."
Central to Stierwald's analysis is the concept of voter turnout.
 Pennsylvania's latest poll results are pretty shocking.
Why are you supporting the vice president?
We could see there's a coordinated attack happening on certain polling markets.
You're going to vote.
I don't think they've walked it back.
"These are close races, but the stakes are incredibly high."
"I mean, we're not talking about, you know, Joe Biden who had the fake Scranton appeal."
He's doing a town hall style rally right now.
I think they will.
"So I have to tell you, it is absolutely stunning to me that Kamala Harris, who's running to be this country's commander in chief, has not spoken to these 13 families of the fall, these 13 Gold Star families."
You and I both know what I'm talking about.
That's Democrats.
The state court is halting enforcement of a requirement that voters include accurate handwritten dates on envelopes used to submit mail-in ballots.
So I understand why Trump was angry about Arizona.
He was in the New York courthouse yesterday.
"And he's really been our friend, right?"
Does she need to do a bit of a better job selling her vision for the economy?
"So whether this election is making you feel excited or scared or hopeful or frustrated or anything in between, do not sit back and hope for the best."
He is someone who will stop at nothing to claim power for himself.
I run a restaurant.
"Thanks, Nnedi."
That I'm more uncertain of.
"And joining us now to dive into the most recent polls from Pennsylvania is Nathaniel Rakic, your senior elections analyst for ABC's 538."
It was not an insurrection.
These are family values.
"There a former popular Republican governor, Larry Hogan, is running for a Senate seat that has been in Democratic hands for decades."
We need a president who works for all the American people.
Nobody is fighting harder for America than Donald Trump.
We saw it on January 6th.
"Unbelievable, and there's plenty of stuff on his website."
"It's typically held at the Capitol, but it doesn't need to be."
"Emerson and insider advantage, they're good pollsters, and right now, they found Trump plus one and Trump plus two."
You get the idea of what's going on.
Listeners can keep up with this story and more at thecentersquare.com.
Yeah Joe and needless to say coming back here after everything that happened post the debate you can see how energized voters are.
"As I have said many times, I tell it like I see it."
"It's dead even not only nationally, but in these battleground states."
Jesus went to the margins.
"That does lift the Vice President's electoral counts up to 250 as she continues to trail Trump's 270, with 16 electoral votes in North Carolina still marked down as toss-up."
Why are these commissioners fighting not to give the routers?
And are you going to have to say the vice president asked me to deliver this message?
"And I mean, this is that I would presume that like, this is the demographic, right?"
Or what's it look like right now?
"If it's plus Republican one, that's good."
There's questions about how the hurricane is going to impact voter turnout there.
It's inflation.
Politico is trying to sanitize it.
 We're still awaiting results from two key states that could outline Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's path to victory.
"Jess, before she left Georgia, she sat for an interview with Reverend Al Sharpton."
"Well, there are two kinds of ways you can look at that question."
It's a good look.
"I mean, I will tell you, it's fairly incredible to me, Bram."
And that's why they reacted that way to him.
Joe Biden was down two points in the state.
So drunk against and votes in the Jewish vote as well.
"However, I have just seen Kamala's report and it's not good."
"You know, you look at it."
It will liberate.
Now what did the voters think about tonight?
"Voting rights and democracy, women's rights, workers rights, you could add to that list, obviously."
"That was fascinating Because instead of talking about the Trump curious which we often talk about we have Kamala curious There are some people who still want to know more they're not all the way there And I think you know that that is gonna be an interesting dynamic in some of these Battleground states where there are still swing districts I don't necessarily believe we can have wild swings the way we used to given gerrymandering etc But there are people who want to know more You know one of the things that was said on there's no doubt about that that you know One of the disadvantages she has, you know, and Scott's talked about it a lot is she's the vice president."
"But these numbers are very, very good for Republicans."
Arizona really seems to be trending.
"This is our last week's number, but the new one's going to be the exact same thing."
"The contrast is clear and I'll tell you what, I would much rather be us than them."
"They need people on the ground who get it, who can connect with those voters authentically."
"And if you look at the board, the Democrats have to win almost all of the swing states, including the two heavyweights, which are Michigan and Pennsylvania."
And I know it's your shirt here.
"But like I said before, this doesn't mean that Harris will for sure win Pennsylvania."
"And when you take a stand, as I have and as Kamala has, to take on what I call greed, inflation, going after price gouging, decidedly in favor of a middle class tax cut, helping folks pay for child care, helping folks make ends meet, when you take on those fights, which are, I think, at the core of what people are concerned about, you're going to piss off a lot of billionaires."
She says that she was raised on a pig farm without insulation or running water and like an outhouse.
"OK, now it's a Harris point eight."
Is she Elizabeth Taylor?
"I don't know because, you know, Republicans, listen, I don't believe that fully."

her ineptitude and her Incompetence and her Her war on the Second Amendment.
"Disruptions from the pandemic then caused prices to spike, and that put a strain on family budgets."
"If not, even Josh Shapiro would be enough to win the presidency."
But because that would be murder.
He survived two assassination attempts.
They could be right.
The issues at play are deeply personal for many voters.
And they never.
Very accurate in 2020.
The next Biden versus Trump rematch.
"Yeah, true."
"This is the white house's response, which is incredible."
Minnesota is in.
What do you think that Americans in the middle thought about what they heard tonight?
We've had a historic pandemic that wrecked havoc on communities and businesses.
Donald Trump has been convicted of a felony.
"The results confirmed by hand recount in several counties, including Maricopa."
Much bleeding took place.
If the leaked internal polling from the Harris campaign shows that she's losing meaningfully in states like Michigan.
President Obama had the model in 2008 when he first ran.
"We had a meeting this morning, very productive meeting."
I'm Manny the movie guy for ANC.
"People were afraid, and they've lost everything."
The Biden-Harris administration has fought a war on American energy production since day one.
Quinnipiac had Trump losing seniors by like three.
Four people suffered burn injuries and one from a fall.
"Rachel, he's traveling to the state on Saturday for a rally with those top Republican candidates."
"And you can see on the averages, they weren't exactly, you know, massively in favor for Kamala Harris."
We have to keep fighting.
"I mean, she gave her the benefit of the doubt."
"Well, fundamentally, the security presence here, as you can imagine, is extremely enhanced."
"Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020 by just 81,000 votes."
And he did that.
We want you to go vote because of something you just said on the back end there.
"No, I'm all right."
I didn't know he'd go this far This is surprising.
"Yes, Nikki Haley got 18% of the vote for some points at the night."
Let's see if let's see if we can get get this done outside of the court.
"And so knowing its history and knowing how close Pennsylvania has been in the past, in 2024, there is no expectation that Pennsylvania should be a massive state for either side of the aisle."
 Welcome to the NewsHour.
"Okay, here's the picture."
"Is there anything to stand up there and say, I'm proud of X, Y, and Z?"
"Well, we'll keep in touch with you as we get all those other little data points you were referring to."
Let's see what happened.
"All of them, the Republicans and the Democrats are voting for Harrison Walls on this campaign."
And there's been some polls lately.
This one's even might even be better actually.
"The last time we saw him and supported him, my son and I were at Washington, D.C. January 6th."
"It was a lead that had been pretty substantial and had been maintained for quite some time, but was building up in the immediate aftermath of the first presidential debate that ultimately ended with Joe Biden dropping out of the presidential race."
"The optics with this guy, it's just, he keeps posting W's, but the big W that is make or break is on November 5th."
"Okay, Trump shooter."
"It is my humble pleasure to introduce our amazing Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris."
"If you say, Well, I'm mad about higher prices."
"Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania has the highest probability of getting the nod according to traders on polymarket, the crypto-based betting platform."
"In my opinion, kind of nervous."
"First of all, can you clear up for us?"
They want to do their jobs.
"The media can pick it apart, but people are gonna vote."
Those those pollsters suck.
"Oh, wait a minute."
"If the truck driver who's delivering the groceries to the grocery store is paying 45% more for diesel, and he is under Kamala Harris's leadership, then we're all paying more for groceries."
"Well, just two things."
"No, I haven't thought of that with transitive property."
I know that she will work in good faith with Republicans in Congress to address a congressional legislative fix to our broken border and immigration system.
"So when you look at this and you talk about the state, you see Harris in those teamster polls."
Important role.
It's very hard to say.
"At the end of the day, I think you heard in Bob Casey a sense that he believes he's closer to the heart of Pennsylvania and tried to staple Dave McCormick to Donald Trump, who is also popular, but he lost the state the last time around."
"What are the bigger problems, the logistics and the particular problems that stand in the way of people voting, or the misdissent malinformation that causes people to think there's something wrong with the system?"
"In a hypothetical two-way race between Harris and Trump, Harris has a slight lead over Trump at 51 to 46 percent."
Other people have their own opinions on it.
I joked with her the other day when I saw her Pennsylvania.
He's my friend.
"No, no, I'm sorry."
But it's probably vetted and that doesn't happen.
It's crazy to me that you actually need to pay homeless people to come and see You at your rally and then not even going I mean they're getting free stuff You get a free concert man.
"OK, right now."
"But as you're noting, we're seeing something of a different pattern potentially this year."
The speculation in Pennsylvania's political world has come to an end.
So we'll see what happens here.
"What they ended up doing is casting a law that allows you to, that requires actually county recorders to kick people off the early ballot list if they don't vote in enough elections in between each presidential election."
But we have this dead heat.
"Campaign focus and strata, Harris has been making numerous trips to Pennsylvania, emphasizing a broader strategy that goes beyond traditional Democratic strongholds."
Social security should not be taxed.
Quinnipiac is awful.
"And I know there's a myth out there that'll say, well, Donald Trump is only polling so well because right-leaning pollsters, they say, are flooding the zone."
"I've interviewed him a bunch of times, meaning a veteran that he's been there a while."
This is a scene where the air is live tonight.
Carmela?
I'll tell you why.
"They could still play a spoiler role, but not for the reasons that they anticipated."
"She's not downright awful, it seems, compared to Cara Mund, who would have been the worst choice."
And I believe that and whether anyone else wants to believe that that's fine.
One last question before we go.
Kamala Harris received 50% of the vote and Donald Trump 48%.
"And it's a difficult one because the steel industry, the U.S. Steel Corporation, basically says if this deal doesn't go through, we may shut down the last furnaces in the Mon Valley here in the Pittsburgh area, and we might even move the headquarters out of Pittsburgh."
"They are landing at Sky Harbor, right?"
"And I think a lot of our grandparents are just saying, could we get a little bit of help?"
"It's like, really?"
One more observation there.
It's insulting and he just made it worse with that statement there.
"And that is Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania."
"Okay, they've got the shooter."
A woke military.
Casey was way ahead.
Trump's message of economic strength and job creation resonates strongly with voters concerned about inflation.
So this is like dead heat in a lot of these polls.
"The Trump campaign should throw everything at the state, not just invest some resources."
We thought we'd get 37 in Philadelphia burbs in the four counties.
This was a sham from the very beginning.
Is that a direct translation to a vote for Biden?
"But at the same time, look at some of these things that we do measure."
These are the guys that should be supporting working class.
"Who is she, and why does she have Donald Trump's ear?"
"And keep in mind, this is mail, by the way."
That that's a that's a real risk for him.
"Donald Trump, I think in our collective opinion, certainly mine, is an unserious man."
Such regions include Beaver County.
What does that mean under our system?
Is she coming?
"You know, got all the flags, make custom flags as well."
"And both Feig and Aquafina have great things to say about our own Dali de Leon, who steals some scenes in the movie."
It was won in the past by President Clinton.
"But once everybody recognized something was afoot here when the Secret Service moved in to former President Trump, everybody recognized the severity of the situation and there were people moving in different directions, running into each other or just face planting into the grass or into the ground."
"Again, rising take-home pay, low inflation."
Are you ready to protect freedom?
A lot of the big issues for me were the fact that Kamala is a politician and the debate is a politician's game and I believe that she definitely has a better convincing point for who to vote for.
They now found Trump tied in Pennsylvania.
And that's what President Trump did.
"I said, let's calm down."
"And it's very possible Clark County this cycle could end up being like a mini version of what we saw in Miami-Dade County, Florida last cycle in the Vegas area."
"In the second poll, conducted by Signal from August 14 to 15, with 800 likely voters, Harris received 48% of the vote, while Trump received 47%."
That's why I believe he was able to win Pennsylvania.
Democrats had roughly 1.1 million.
That's what Kamala is going to do.
That makes a lot of sense.
"And what they did and how they acted to try to help Trump and abet Trump in this stuff, when they knew better, was genuinely surprising to me."
"If you're Harris, you want to be up by two to three points on average, not up by point five, because you are one point away from losing Pennsylvania and more than likely losing the presidency."
"And ultimately, you're sort of relying on, OK, she may be doing the old TikTok here and there maybe for Gen Z or whatever."
Trump almost did better than 2016.
Can you hear that?
"And unfortunately, people are buying it."
I think about this a lot because it's so different from what we see right now out of the Republican nominee and increasingly the entire party has just decided it's okay.
I appreciate your time.
And that's a point of difference that he can underline for these workers as well.
As we saw at this law school in Harrisburg.
"Then in 92, some people wanted Bill Clinton to pick Jesse Jackson."
"Yes, some of them are mad about my clothes."
"I'm here to tell you, and this is based on Cliff Maloney."
Are you happy with that answer?
I'm sitting down with Dick Pullman full-time writer in residence and journalism professor here at Penn He also wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer for 22 years and now writes about politics weekly on his own platform.
Two of the most critical battleground states.
"Just send somebody in and say, Hey, JD Vance, he's running for vice president."
"And if she doesn't get North Carolina for her, it basically comes down to Pennsylvania."
That's the picture.
"I don't think we have to worry about him, do we?"
Take a selfie of yourself or your friends and your family here at this event.
"You need one more state, even Nevada with its only six electoral votes you win."
"So too, I mean, remember at the DNC, he spoke first instead of speaking his ass and then he left."
"You got a state race, a presidential race."
"For some Pennsylvania elected official Democrats, party leaders and allies, 20 of whom, political spoke to to this article, they're anxious, the in-state operation has set them back."
And you are the type of person we want to be the president.
They call you weird.
"Well, it's an incredibly popular policy."
That's a great guy.
I think I'm gonna cancel my trip.
"I mean, with these demographics itself, I would find it very hard for."
"But the essence, I mean, part of diplomacy is meeting with your enemies."
He also said he would pardon the January 6th rioters who attacked police officers if they are innocent.
I want everybody to take a deep breath.
"And we do know that even if Trump wins Pennsylvania by two and a half to three, that's still a close race."
"Now the latest 2024 survey in Maine via the University of New Hampshire, ironically enough, is Harris leading Trump by a whopping 17 points, with 58% to 41%, among almost 1000 likely voters sampled between August 15th and 19th."
I would imagine they're comparing where we're at right now in early September of 2024 with where it was in 2020.
"We've gotten new data over the past few days in terms of the recent two polls, but the recent Bloomberg poll trumps up by six."
I think it's important to remember that we are voting for the leader of our country and not who we like the most Or who we want in our wedding party But who is actually going to make our country better and we're in an incredibly unique situation Where we've had both of the candidates in office before and we've gotten to see what they do and when facts come to facts My life was better when Trump was in office.
"And that is a huge thing for her electability and her odds, because I think this is exactly why you're starting to see Kamala Harris do quite well in these battleground states, do quite well on the national level as well, because the national polls have also shifted."
And I represent middle America.
And so this is really interesting here And so what we can see in this state also in the state of Pennsylvania was going to come really close is so there's this article It talks about how Pennsylvania slipping from Donald Trump's grasp and it says Kamala Harris gains ground with crucial Hispanic voters in swing state That could decide 2024 election.
So the target here today is on those voters.
"And I think this time Trump's going to be the winner in Florida, probably within an hour because they do the early the mail in voting early."
"Because part of it makes me think, not speaking to men directly, part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as President."
"And we, of course, are the Saudi Arabia of natural gas."
This is the Lancaster Democrats' headquarters has been for a number of years.
And Ace.
"I mean, possibly because I was in literally in the suburbs, so maybe that's why the targeting was there, but it seemed to me like that, I took note of the fact that it was so strong, so unified in that message from both of those candidates, from the Senate candidates, as well as the presidential candidates that clearly they've got a lot of internals, this is the main thing to go all in on."
We'll see what they have to say.
"Yeah, I also think I think economy."
This is actually one of the few places where former President Donald Trump won that is actually represented by a Democrat in Congress.
They keep calling people a tinks and lying about reparations and then trying to argue why it's appropriate to mutilate your children.
"You know, this is a really bad poll."
Would you have done something differently?
And I purposely convened them.
And that gap?
"By emphasizing this point, Trump's campaign can paint Democrats as being opposed to necessary safeguards, potentially swaying undecided voters and those concerned about election security."
"And the question is, when you've got 5% of the electorate that is still not made up their mind, that is a big, big number with margins that are as tight as they are in Arizona and a lot of the other battleground states."
Arizona is a border state.
"It actually does matter, Jeff!"
They'll do it.
"Oh, I'm not putting my money anywhere yet at all."
"Rubin's support reflects a growing trend of sports figures engaging in political advocacy, using their platforms to influence public opinion and drive change."
"Not only that very alarming reporting that you did about the color of the pens that the counters were using, but also the fact that it's being run by this private company that doesn't appear to have any experience ever doing anything like this before."
Any comments?
"He got more than 93% of the vote, more than 616,000 votes doing better than Obama in 2012."
You have no idea what he's talking about.
Both candidates will make the case for why they are better either now or better four years ago.
Does that typically boost sales when one of the candidates says something like that?
Same thing with insider advantage.
"Yeah, throughout the selection season, Bob Casey has had generally a comfortable lead."
"And also there was a statement by some Democratic, some sort of a Democratic leader."
"There was one that would require you to include some kind of paperwork when you return your early ballot, which of course is a way of disqualifying early ballot voters who don't include that."
Because it sounds like they've got a lot of work to do.
"So I honestly, between those two, I would rather have Oz."
"A history of, for example, something that still exists that I've worked on to address, which is racial bias and home appraisals."
"Now they're out here slugging it out, spending millions upon millions of dollars in what should be a sure bet for them."
Remember what wasn't like what 95% of black women voted for Barack Obama and like 94% voted for Hillary.
They are more similar to them in social policy ideas But they're just very different because they don't want to be like Russia's underling like they were back in the Soviet Union's days.
That's plus three for Kamala Harris.
"Donald Trump decided to give an interview in with the, the biggest Pennsylvania local media station, Action News."
"Then he talks about, he says he knows guns, but just listen to what he's saying."
They've casted those voted early in person or by mail.
I can't control myself.
"They released a statement in CBS News magazine Sunday reading in part quote, when we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point."
That I think would be the easiest way to victory.
Now he said Democrats complaints are a reflection of their anxiety over a tight race.
"And the good news is that if you're that you have candidates to vote for in this election that demonstrate that kind of character, who know what real strength looks like, who will set a good example and do the right thing and lead this country better than they found it."
"Then you then I think you have to then say, Yeah, but what about character?"
"Buckle up, because this is going to be a wild ride."
So why is Trump campaigning in California and New York?
"I mean, what the hell?"
"Well, neither does Trump at this point."
That is not how democracies are supposed to work.
"And just to add on to what you were saying, you know, we are entrepreneurs."
"I parked somewhere and I walked and I was like, I'll get to the end of the line."
But but you have to just know that it's real.
"That survey says of the 50 economists who responded to the survey's question on inflation, 68% said prices would rise faster under Trump than under Harris."
That is actually leading at 52 percent.
Which is exactly why we need Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States of America.
It just went down 100 bucks.
How are these hearings supposed to change people's minds when they can't even change the minds of people in the hearing?
"I will say that in Donald Trump today, and just really the whole weekend, he's been parked up in Pennsylvania."
Pennsylvania is just critical.
"Well, why is the government printing trillions and trillions of dollars?"
Donald Trump is a 78 year old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he wrote down his golden escalator nine years ago.
"So today is Sunday, October 20th."
I just wonder if it'll be enough.
"Autocrats begin by vilifying the press, demonizing their and dehumanizing their opponents and co-opting the judiciary."
"So here is what Donald Trump is going to do, two big things for our senior citizens in Arizona and all across the country."
He's independent.
"Look, I'm from western Pennsylvania."
"Yeah, anyway."
Charlie Williams and I will moderate along with Univision 65's Ilya Garcia.
"Okay, so they came, and then Newsom, all of a sudden, that whole thing petered out, and it was a bait and switch."
They were still undecided on how they're going to vote.
You know I think that Kamala has a lot of good plans for the future and I think that since she wasn't the one that was mainly in charge you know even though she is vice president there is Congress and there is checks and balances so like she can't do everything I think that with her being more empowered president I think that she would be able to do a better job.
"And so if you take a look over here, a lot of times at these types of rallies, you see a lot of guns."
"The economy has been, once again, the most important topic or issue in this debate to Pennsylvania voters."
I'm going to keep those conversations private.
So those around Trump said that he has long feared the attempt on his life.
Is he going to stay in the race?
"I don't have details on the shooter yet, although I have heard that the shooter is down, that they have the person."
"But now it's, it's a harder call just because I am not a fan of Donald Trump."
But it's also kind of scary how much misinformation is out there in those echo chambers where people just see what they already agree with.
And he can keep doing that.
According to this poll 48 47 in Wisconsin.
Do you think that's the state of the race in your home state tonight?
"â€”So, as you know, I worked for him for 10 years."
"I have no desire to go I don't think I I might have covered one at some point Credentials you can't just go walk in There's a much deeper question so Bruce and I have been asked hey, do you know anybody who can get us into the Harris event?"
We have got Congresswoman Debbie Lesko.
And they had an interview.
They had lots of President Trump flags.
"I'm sure they'll make something like, oh, it costs money or something like that."
You're going to base your decision on that.
And I want to dispel any myths right here and now that there is no ground game.
"Dave, I've been in your your great Commonwealth now two weeks in a row."
"She has no principal, only expendancy, and will say whatever a particular audience wants her to hear."
But we have another song coming out in hopefully a month that is a tongue in cheek song about these political elites who believe they're the smartest and the best and they're better than you.
"But no, that's the best number that we've had."
Reporters were wandering around there last night.
"I mean, Obama won it."
Mark I'm excited for this to have an economy that's clean.
Nobody's perfect.
"And so, you know, this is obviously going to continue."
"As I said this morning, crank up those horns."
And I also believe that I am accurate in knowing that most Americans want a leader who brings us together as Americans and not someone who professes to be a leader who is trying to have us point our fingers at each other.
We have real problems.
"But his method of doing so, I find, would not I would venture to say would not be pleasing to most of your constituents."
Harris plus three.
"Let me know down below Especially if you're in one of these states, it's really impactful like, you know, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, etc but super interesting to see this sort of growth and Genesis of the cup."
"This is part of that conversation, clearly."
No one should go to jail for smoking weed which is hilarious because Kamala Harris prosecuted and put people in jail for smoking weed which is just wild and made jokes about it.
"You don't want to be up by three and on top of that insider advantage, which is a good pollster."
All labor.
"It was local I've been wanting to see Trump I voted for Trump the first time around and second time around And I want to see him in office this time around what in particular about Trump made you want to vote for him three times now Well, he his values align with my values if you can see my hat."
Forty seven versus six for Harris.
It's not a not a binary switch as to whether you've won or lost.
Watch where the candidates spend their time.
The New York Times poll also has not been included on this average here.
"That kind of blunder happening in this day and age by the highly skilled, highly capable U.S. security agency that's supposed to be protecting leaders of the free world is almost unbelievable."
That's how evil they are.
"And I know that sounds like double standard, but it's not."
"And when you say tight, just to put it into perspective for you, 2016, it was what, 1800 votes?"
We did not need to wear masks all the way into the summer.
Nice and full.
And what else do you think he brings to the ticket?
"And of course, Jason is also the co-founder of this incredible business where we make very, very good products for the United States of America."
So former President Donald Trump returning to battleground Georgia today for two campaign events.
So people are very passionate about their politics.
But it is a general election campaign for a Democrat that actually is interested in in winning and not just winning for the sake of it.
"Even though that's not really true, they don't align themselves with Donald Trump."
And here to discuss it is Republican strategist and CNN political commentator Alice Stewart and former Fox News politics editor Chris Steierwalt.
He kind of does remind me of what people say is one of the great big.

"Small business help, child tax credits."
And of course this is pretty insulting in many ways but provide one million dollar loans that are forgivable for up to twenty thousand dollars for black entrepreneurs and others.
"They interviewed 45% were Democrats, 44% were Republicans, and only 9% were independents, that's very interesting to me, all right?"
Now let's get started.
"Since Harris became the presumptive nominee, another campaign official said more than 20,000 new volunteers have signed up."
"You know, not having just me, I think you're having everybody in Pennsylvania is here."
He shot at Trump and I believe the teleprompter glass is what ricocheted and cut him on the air.
Let's read it really quick.
It is still something that troubles voters.
Why is it taking so long?
"We were out there, for example, in late June discussing this with waiters and bartenders who said, yeah, on paper, that's a great idea."
"Also, PCs do things outside of playing games."
"They're actually just doing this right now through massive cash infusion, Pennsylvania, of course, being the biggest state."
Tim cast music.
"It is said, the winner of Pennsylvania will win."
"If you can see the setup behind me, he's going to be moderate."
"I'm sure that you think that a policy debate would be better than a personality debate, but if President Biden had gone on stage and spoke about the size of a pro golfer's penis, I think you would be on this show right now saying you were shocked and appalled, and you would suggest it was evidence of his cognitive decline."
Let's begin first with Jake Rosen and then we'll pivot to Nydia Kavaza.
"So as far as I was concerned, for someone to ask me in the, I would call it a paucity, there was no evidence being presented of any strength."
We'll call them Rameshian kind of Republicans that live on the South side.
"For parts of two centuries, scores of black men and women put their lives on the line for the right to vote, and that's what keeps voter engagement as a top priority for the National Panhellenic Council, the governing body for nine of the country's oldest and most prominent black sororities and fraternities."
"Does anybody, would anybody like to keep red meat?"
"Yeah, I'll be there."
But right here right now Donald Trump officially has taken the lead.
They're not sending him to Wisconsin.
It's it's really it's about the choice It's not about the money or it's about policies or those kinds of obscure things It's it's about the choice and what kind of a direction do we want our nation to go in and after all those things?
Pacey supported Nikki Haley but won't vote for Donald Trump.
"He's gonna speak shortly here to Harris for president, Raleigh and Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan will be there with him."
We have a cool full screen.
They also did lead a prayer at one point in time in the parking lot and then as I said went back and forth between here and the state capital.
Everyone knows Trafalgar is complete garbage.
A pollster is undercounting Donald Trump's voter support.
"Well, if they'd all been properly vetted, that probably wouldn't have happened."
So like Dr. Oz being a carpet bagger is actually part of this conversation too.
Thank you both for joining me tonight.
You see doctors for Harris.
"So the fact that Trump is polling above Biden in Pennsylvania, when Biden's the incumbent, you'd have to say is a good sign."
I would be shocked if the ultimate winner of the election wasn't the person who won Pennsylvania.
This is what it looks like.
"But what I want to ask all of you all together at this point Like I said, none of you were ready to make a commitment to any candidate November Please raise your hand right now if you're now ready to make a commitment after today Wow, I'm just kind of surprised about we haven't rehearsed this Seven of you are now ready Scott yes, I'm gonna vote for a Kamala Harris Andy."
"And after Kamala Harris wraps up her remarks in Charlotte, she'll then head here."
"Yet we have a president that has not moved on this issue, has just been unveiled that both USAID and the State Department have provided the report to the White House administration that Israel, the Israeli government did block humanitarian aid, which would permit now the American government from withholding weapons distribution towards the Israeli government, which it had not done."
I count the votes.
She's going to be hitting these blue wall states.
"So it makes you wonder, like, how do you actually be a smart consumer of all this political content flying around, especially with the election coming up?"
"I couldn't be more proud to serve as the governor and to have earned the votes, not just of Democrats, but Republicans and independents as well who propelled me to victory each time I've run for office."
These are the things that actually make our life worth living.
"And it's gotten more and more absurd, which on the one hand can make you feel dismissive, like leave it alone."
But he's at 48 in Michigan.
"I didn't feel we had any good choices, and I'm still not sure we do."
I'm seeing another ambulance move in right now Adriana.
"They never make it easy for us, but she's going to be easy."
You had to go through metal detectors.
"The mediating countries, the US, Qatar and Egypt, have so far failed to narrow differences to reach an agreement."
And some of the basic things if you talk about constitution is hanging by a thread and it is our constitution is hanging by a thread.
There's been inflation scars.
"And just for the sake of argument, the middle of October poll of Quinnipiac had Biden plus eight."
"That's OK. Go ahead, Dennis."
So that's a four and a half point on average lead for Hillary Clinton when she won by two.
It's going to go back down at ebbs and flows.
That's just not how it works.
"That's all, that's all I see."
" Alright man, so we got some absolutely huge news here for the Kamala Harris campaign."
Those things haven't changed in Pennsylvania.
"So I have to do them for, you know, my Trump girls."
"And just to be clear, having gone to these and presented American flags to families of the fallen, I'll tell you that quite personally, it is very it's a very, very difficult thing to attend."
I think Oz is slightly better.
"I mean, what Marjorie Taylor Greene is saying right there is that she would have been happy to carry out a treasonous attack on the government."
"So we'll have to see, guys."
It doesn't smell right.
They're still trying to kill him.
In a statement the Harris campaign says Trump's proposals to raise the national sales tax will raise costs for families by thousands of dollars per year.
And that's because she really believes in sparking growth among small businesses in this country.
And what this shows is that Biden he wasn't even running against anybody.
Now in the red camp Donald Trump was at an election rally in Joe Biden's hometown Scranton in Pennsylvania.
"So not completely worthless, but still good."
"It doesn't mean everybody's going to flip and be Elizabeth Warren the next day, right?"
"It's a state that, you know, Scott Walker had been governor of for a number of years."
" Kamala Harris is in Pennsylvania tonight, which may very well be the most important tipping point state in this year's election."
"You know, Tim said it."
"And right now, it looks like Trump will do better in November than he did four years ago."
And just looking through these key counties on the eastern half of Pennsylvania.
"Welcome back, everyone."
"And I think that we need to really focus on making sure that he is not elected, of course, because he is a threat to our democracy."
"London cast a primary vote for Haley, then switched her registration to independent."
"And those earning about that threshold may over the US taxes, despite already having paid taxes in their host nation."
"James Cooper â€“ $6 million James Cooper, a billionaire known for his real estate empire, has donated $6 million to Harris' campaign."
"Trump's winning Arizona, according to the Real Clear Politics average."
"Anyway, so if you're in Pennsylvania and you're not freaking registered to vote, not registered to vote, registering people like my man, Scott Pressler, you're wrong."
"So even this, if these 10,000 were to be thrown out, these could be deciding votes, especially because if they're on net votes, like if you guys remember back in 2020, I remember, you know, trying to explain to people even after it looked like the red mirage was happening on the night of election, right?"
And so that also continues to reaffirm that Kamala Harris is in fact in the lead in Pennsylvania.
So that's still a pretty favorable to poll to Trump.
"So I think a lot of that was just petty politics, unfortunately."
"Yeah, it's a little bit more of an internal."
Chikom yes I know I mispronounced that.
It had been floating at the county level for a few hours when suddenly local press started to print it out.
I made that very clear in 2020.
She's gonna win in a landslide.
That was going to happen.
We shall thus begin with the lean blue states starting in New Mexico.
"Let's say she gains I'll give her two, okay She wins by one half right, but then I get but I think bucks trends to the right by two So right word a right word trend which is something that definitely Trump would be open for just likely it's not like the rest of the Pennsylvania suburbs and Here it is."
"I watched while the attack was underway, understood very clearly what he did on January 6th, what he failed to do on January 6th."
"Now, am I saying this?"
"No, no, absolutely not."
"Pennsylvania has a Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, who enjoys widespread popularity."
"It's a real moving target, you know."
I think he's worse than Oz.
"Almost a month to go, and everyone is eagerly waiting to see who the new president will be."
"And did he ever receive, did you ever receive from him that evidence either during the call, after the call, or to this day?"
"Okay, we're living in an insane asylum right now, okay?"
They have voted the exact same since I believe 1988.
"Again, it's hours until the library opens up."
And what do I get?
You may lower your hands.
"They got the guy, Trump footage shooter being dragged out."
And what was wrong with the country?
"The vice president just laughed, but in fact, in September, Harris visited Pennsylvania once every three days, a remarkable frequency for a battleground state."
I love the energy of all this.
English is my second language.
You're still finding Harris plus five.
"And if that's not the case, then a liberal needs to explain to me why do they make it extremely hard and try and find all these loopholes to where we just want to secure election."
Those are the two counties.
Now all of a sudden they're aligned with Kamala.
Former President Donald Trump at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks last night for a town hall.
The voting block of the Amish have gone up over a thousand percent from 16 to 2020.
"Kamala already worked with Joe Biden to take on the drug companies, bring down the cost of insulin."
I think that's the one to go with.
I'll say that.
As we get closer and closer to the election and Republicans are more likely to use their right to early vote later in the early voting process.
"But no matter how big or powerful the opposition may be, you must never forget our nation does not belong to them."
"Now, there is a debate that we're also watching very closely."
And I have to show you this video.

Problem is the rest of the state is voting and look at the trend.
I woke up.
I've never heard him say one racist thing in my life.
"The first one, like you mentioned is Jill Stokie."

"Associated Press, the Harris-Walls campaign has reserved $370 million in advertising from Labor Day to Election Day, with $170 million allocated for television ads in battleground states and over $200 million for digital platforms like Hulu, Roku, and YouTube."
"So I think not only can she build on the coalition that Biden put together last time, but I think she's in a really strong position to really focus on the issues that matter a lot in the burbs."
"That's why we feel so betrayed, that our president rather choose and side with Benjamin Netanyahu over the American people."
"Pennsylvania stands out as a microcosm of broader national political trends, characterized by stark contrast between urban and rural areas."
 Are Democrats right to be nervous about Pennsylvania?
"Trump's message of economic nationalism, including his promises to bring back manufacturing jobs and renegotiate trade deals, resonated strongly with voters in the state in both 2016 and 2020."

"But what is the Harris, Biden-Harris administration done?"
"No, I highly doubt someone that became a Republican the last two months is going to vote for Kamala Harris."
We had one of the deadliest hurricanes in American history.
"And I know that sounds crazy, but some Democrats really believe that all the polls are going to understate Harris this time around."
That's not to say that Trump didn't win a lot of those voters or hold a lot of those voters from 2020 because he absolutely did.
"It was roughly 15,000 in Detroit, more than 14,000, 12,000 in Phoenix and Las Vegas, respectively, over the weekend."
"This is just fantastic, no other way around that."
"The man's, a little nasty sometimes, posts some mean tweets, bad character, right?"
Like listen to the whole speech.
"While former First Lady Melania Trump has yet to appear at any campaign rallies, Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, recently had a beer while watching a football game in suburban Philadelphia and spoke at a voter registration concert in Pittsburgh."
We call that poll hurting.
It's a place that was won by President Biden.

"That we see in each other our connection, our interdependence, what we see in each other which fortifies and reinforces that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us."
"If we end with Harris getting 48.7 Trump getting 48.3, the election's not close."

"Now Biden is also a moron, but that's been worsened by his declining mental state because of his advanced age."
"Yeah, everyone's pumped."
Her campaign just issued a statement.
Like if Trump wins Pennsylvania more than likely he wins the presidency and vice versa.
So now they're running him again.

So we don't have to just simply be a robot and vote for a party that's lost.
"And yet, when Donald Trump lies or cheats or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls POWs losers or fellow citizens vermin."
There's a lot of other parts in Pennsylvania.
That would make me jittery.
"Specifically, there are concerns about Nikki Liu, Harris's campaign manager in the state."
Inspirations is all the movies.
It's a reminder that every vote counts and every voice matters.
It's disgraceful.

Both candidates have found support in Pennsylvania in recent polls.

And I think Kamala's policy on codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law is something that's going to resonate with young voters.
"Number two, all the lies that are being told."
And now I'm on Kamala's team.
We also have a key governor's race there.
He refuses to release his medical records.
"Yeah, and especially those undecideds not going to factor into their decision."
"We've got the great Arizona State GOP chairwoman, Gina Suobada."
Trump Vance 219.

"We're turning to the site of that assassination attempt on his life and that's another like X factor in all of this, whether that helps to drive local enthusiasm for Trump."
If you think about it.
Trump has allocated the majority of his advertising budget to Pennsylvania and has held more rallies in this battleground state than any other since Harris officially entered the race for the White House.
I'm sure he's heard his advice.
"So for example, you see this Insider Advantage poll here."
And they are dynamic.

And I'm all for that.
"In 2020, you had a couple, but outside of that, it was mostly Biden plus six, Biden plus seven, Biden plus ten, not Biden plus two, not Biden plus one."
"I mean, because that, you know, there's nothing more important than getting to the bottom of the truth."
He said she's an African-American woman who won office last year on a tough on crime message and when help Harris went over disillusioned black voters and working class white men.
"Like, okay, it's better than Joe, but it seems like the enthusiasm search, which now it looks like it was just an artificial surge by the media."
"To your point, however, there's a brand new poll that just came out yesterday conducted by you go for CBS News and found that Harris has similar support for black voters as Joe Biden did in 2020."

"Yes, yes, yes."
Good to see you.
"That's crucial because that is the swing state that has the most electoral votes and you could lose Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona."
"So John Wick, not very good at polling."

But they can't even supply what they have.
We'll be back soon.
That's option A.
Everyone's voting.
The process is taking a long time because of the verification system they go through.
And so right now the audit of the 2020 presidential election results in Arizona is somehow ongoing.
But the truth is that this is a dangerous delusion for Republicans.
"Muhlenberger, I guess, Rasmussen and Susquehanna."
"McClelland was quick to add, though, that she would support the Democratic ticket regardless of who is nominated for vice president, but praised Cooper as the best choice."
He's living a lie.
" And staying with the U.S. presidential election, former President Barack Obama has opened a can of worms after he lectured black men to vote for Kamala Harris while speaking in Pennsylvania last week."
"But basically, it's a common divide we've been seeing."
Hear me when I say.
"If anything, the real reason why Hillary Clinton lost wasn't Jill Stein."
Now it is up to Harris at 48.3.
"Their poll before the election didn't have that many undecideds and it was actually very accurate, which is very telling because you need Pennsylvania."
"I think that what's important to note is that one, by the time that the election gets here, which will be on November 5th, Vice President Harris would have spent about two billion dollars, or at least have raised at least two billion dollars."
"All of that is part of a western Pennsylvania strategy, not only to make that state more winnable, but also make your outreach more persuasive, possibly, in Wisconsin and Michigan."

"Abortion, other social issues."
"Harris has expanded her campaign efforts into these regions, including Beaver County, Lancaster County and Fayette County, to connect with voters who may not be as familiar with her."
"But even if there's a one point miss, a two point miss, which is, by the way, much more accurate than 2020, which again, in 2020, in September of 2020, excuse me, it was Biden plus four."

"Early this morning, KDK's Barry Pintar loaded up into a car and met up with Dan Snyder of CBS News Philadelphia in the heart of Pennsylvania."

There's a Pennsylvania House race that is also fascinating.
You're ready.
"We're going to choose not just the political direction of the country, the cultural direction of the country as well."

" In Arizona, former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis is now cooperating with prosecutors in the state's fake electors case, according to that state's attorney general."

Do you think fracking is like central to the minds of voters in Pennsylvania?
"John Riebel, just experience an ad."

"Yeah, you have."
"Well, do you care more about the election now?"
"For the Democrats, I think they're obligated to make this an issue."
But I really appreciate your time.

Maybe is a better way to say that by the Democratic base this week.
"I guess it's possible that maybe she wins every other state except Pennsylvania, but I don't see that occurring."
I think it's a pretty interesting strategy She supports miss Harris's plan to continue backing Ukraine's military efforts to repel Russia Even as mr. Trump has suggested that a deal could be brokered to avert more suffering if Ukraine goes to Putin It is the beginning of a domino effect.
"If given a choice between two candidates, one of whom favor granting amnesty to all legal aliens and one of whom all legal aliens and one of whom favor deporting all illegal aliens, MSNBC viewers, 68 percent would support a candidate who gives amnesty to every one of the 20 to 25 million illegal aliens in this country."
"On multiple occasions, yes."
"And just remember that after this election, there will still be plenty of Republicans in the House and the Senate."
James was asking kind of that differential there.
"Uh, this is another interesting trend."
But then there's reporting on the ground.
Were you aware of that?
They were off by seven points back then.
She's ahead in Arizona and North Carolina and narrowing his lead in Nevada and Georgia.
It's improving.
We've got the best sellers.
We can talk about that later.
It's the same argument I used a few weeks ago when this whole thing came up.
Here's what Fetterman said.
Thanks for joining us for this Fox 29 You Decide election special.
"On the pathway to 270, Harris is 226."
"In this case, Donald Trump, who wants to further restrict and limit our freedoms."
You did the right you remember.
"Just moments ago, Whitmer took to the stage."
"Harris's challenge lies in not only maintaining democratic turnout in these counties, but also in appealing to moderate and undecided voters who may feel alienated by either party."
We all read the Post.
"You know, the Biden campaign has been very clear that they want these Haley supporters."
"Okay, we'll start with the economy."
"With its 20 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is a coveted prize for both major political parties."
"But like I said, they're blaming the Democratic party and they're blaming Joe Biden being that he stated that Trump had a bullseye in them."
It's going to be way too expensive under her proposed tax increase.
What are you hearing?
"Please support us by subscribing to our channel, liking this video, and sharing it with your friends to show support for Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign."
"So it's closer than Michigan, it's closer than Wisconsin, and that isn't usually how we would think of PA. We would think of PA as a closer state than what we would think of Wisconsin as, which is usually the tipping point state."
"And if they do, which way are they going to vote is another question because the lower propensity voter, regardless of party registration, has been moving towards Donald Trump over the past four years."
"For Donald Trump, I think it's to reassure people that he's not nuts, that he's not crazy, that he doesn't go off the wall one way or the other, that he's not a misogynist, that he's not somebody who just attacks, attacks, attacks, but rather focuses on his accomplishments during the four years of the Trump administration."
"That advantage of D over R has been narrowed down to 333,000."
"Of course, you heard me said before, your cars will be down and we're getting rid of all the electric."
A solid two point advantage for Harris.
"So on political news, a new poll shows that President Biden is now leading former President Trump in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania."
I think that's the lesson they've learned.
They're going to get state college.
I can't do it.
"So again, Trump with the enthusiasm win important for him and favorability, 48% favorable, 47% unfavorable for Harris, 44% for Harris."
"And I love Philly and Pittsburgh, but they went to rural Beaver County."
"But either way, I would say if you can go into the election night tied in terms of the national party ID down one plus one, that's a win."
The Harris for President campaign is staffing up with hundreds of lawyers as the campaign expects to have to battle Republicans on multiple fronts during and after the election this year.
"Now, of course, he is not the president, doesn't have any control over the military right now, but it is this kind of heightened rhetoric that we're seeing in the closing weeks of the campaign."
I represent a new generation of leadership.
"So it's this, I'll say it again, genuflecting to this man."
And a lot of people didn't see our most recent video because I released it late last night.
"I love that piece Ed, that was really great."
"Barack Marmo, CEO of Deep Well Services bluntly said, quote, I don't believe anybody in the Biden administration."
"Tell us the latest there with this confirmation that really didn't need confirmation, Keung."
A second Democrat elected official in the state described Lew as AWOL.
So how much is he hurting himself when he loses focus on that specific issue?
He was personally insulting her.
"And I get it, it sort of does a bit of a self-service, but when some of these polls actually do get released publicly and the Republican pollsters are sponsoring them, they never want to come back to their base and their core donors and say, we're losing our own poll by a massive amount."
"Maybe, although I happen to think that the questions themselves are what perpetuates the big lie because the questions are baseless by and large."
I think you should pull back up the whole exchange on immigration very early on for that particular voter because I do think there was actually a good exchange on immigration I would politely disagree about why that immigration reform bill was killed and who's responsible and then it was the exchange about that viral video so that's my two cents on this because I thought it was really interesting on the immigration.
The three things she's looking for competence character and core values and she has to have a personal connection and relationship with that person.
"I think it's deception, honestly, and so I think what they could do instead of getting with a lot of these influencers and doing stuff like that is promise to put Gen Z and younger people in higher positions when they start a presidential administration to actually do a lot of good work for Gen Z because they wield the power of the executive branch."
Leading Trump by a comfortable margin of 58% to 33%.
So we'll see how it works out for her.
PS5 pro.
Because his approval rating is 59%.
"And if even they're off by half of what they were back in 2020, let's just be friendly, let's be generous and say they've gotten better, even in that scenario, that's a Trump lead in their own polls."
I literally got to the end of this part of the line.
It tells the tale of what we've been seeing.
They can't afford their electricity bills or their daycare bill.
They get it posthumously.
"How many other, you know, politicians bring this kind of energy to the world?"
Bibles and a sea shoes.
And they mean business.
I'm sorry.
A push for voters to cast their votes early in a battleground state that will be critical for the candidate.
What happened?
"I mean, I've said many times, geez, I wish he hadn't said that."
"I have already provided them many times, including quite recently, and they were flawless."
A free spirit.
Harris offered it to him Tuesday morning as campaign cameras rolled.
"So right now it's all about doing those events, getting out the message."
"He's like, does your family remember what I told them?"
I think you will see him gain a little bit.
"The first one is, does her campaign think she needs to get an even higher percentage of that?"
Don't believe a word Donald Trump says about abortion or IVF.
I believe it was the worst that we've ever had.
"And remember the first question they were like, why are Americans better off right now than they were four years ago under Trump?"
"Anyway, go ahead, please."
"And I want to thank all of the leaders who are here, including Administrator Michael Regan."
"So really, that was a big swing towards President Biden."
"And I know that sounds crazy on paper like, well, OK, Pennsylvania is worth 19 electoral votes the most of any swing states."
"Trump, I do."
"If it wasn't for this, like there's a chance he could still win because of improvements in places like Chester and, you know, Lancaster."
"Let's say by some miracle, Quinnipiac and Bloomberg, they're right in the average."
"And I think one quote that kind of puts that on full display, I believe it was Jeff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia at the DNC, who said voting for Kamala Harris doesn't make you a Democrat."
He has and he will.
"With the regards to this, for the Republicans they're actually the ones closing rank with the exception of the party leadership where the Democrats are the ones that are disorganized at the state level and the local level."
"The former president of the United States, Donald Trump, rallied at Pennsylvania yesterday, went south after someone tried to pop him up."
"I'm not saying that's for sure going to happen, but when you look at the newer polling from like RMG research or even Emerson, it does strongly suggest there was a response bias for Harris, especially a couple of weeks ago."
"And so what we could see here is actually a lot of the people were also who were helping Cornel West in a lot of these states were actually Republicans, like Republican operatives who were like showing up to these electors houses."
Moments after shots have rung out at a rally where President Trump was addressing the crowd.
Do you think truly this can be staged by you because I see so many comments of people saying it is going the extra lens just to be able to get to vote from people and I think the part and the reason why people are saying that it is staged the most was because of the clip that has been going viral where it was telling the person trying to get him off of the stage to calm down so he can make the black feasts into the hair a black power feasts into the hair a lot of people are stitching that part and saying come on like if this is real and not staged it wouldn't have time to be doing all of that on that stage so let me hear what you guys think about all of this I am going to see you guys in the next one.
And IVF you had mentioned before IVF.
I just don't know.
We're going to pull the packet captures out of the routers and then we're going to have a cyber guy.
"And in between on Tuesday, Governor Tim Walz will blitz Western Pennsylvania."
And that was their thing.
"Now, I'm very proud of my mom."
"Let me just tell you, this man has so little understanding of tariffs, he thinks that China pays for them."
He was going to hand me any money.
"It's of course not about me, but I do grow up here."
So let's begin with Dan Snyder in our newsroom.
"Whoa, that's pretty crazy, Investopedia."
"Pennsylvania, a state in flux."
"Virginia has transitioned over the last two decades from a reliably Republican state to a swing state, and it is now strongly Democratic-leaning."
We're just doing the president Obama model.
"Trump has not performed as well though, in 2016 and 2020, Texas usually is shifting to the left."
"So they really do need to make inroads, top Democrats."
Let's see here.
"He's also taking private donations from undeclared sources to carry this out, which means, you know, Trump supporters could be paying for the cyber ninja's company to run an Arizona recount about whether or not Trump won the election."
That gets you pretty close to 270 right there.
U.S. election explained.
"All right, Linda."
"Reporting from Atlanta Georgia, Iris Tao and Hyli News."
"Well, let's ask Pennsylvania GOP Senate candidate Dave McCormick is with us."
All eyes are on Kamala Harris as we wait for the first major decision of her presidential campaign.
Brown's gonna be the nominee.
"She went from 44.3% today to now three points higher and 47.6%, in fact, 3.3% higher."
"Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, that was the three states that put Trump over the edge in 2016."
"Doesn't mean you're going to be millionaires, but you will have a comfortable living if you, you know, work hard."
"So he goes, it's a tough business."
"And it is really, really good news for the Democratic Party in all Pennsylvania will be a state that could genuinely make or break the Republican or Democratic ticket."
"Yes, and I've again worked on that My values have not changed."
She has been asked these questions before.
"By the way, we created this Venn diagram at the Midas Touch Network just to help Maggots understand things."
"And so that's why at least with Trump, we're going to get some dialogue moving in the direction of potential peace as opposed to Democrats bragging about signing shells that are going to be used to, you know, in Russian territory."
"RMG research brings us yet another tie from September 18th to 20th, with both candidates locked at 49%."
"When you escalate, I mean, you're signing a frickin artillery shell."
"When my wife first woke up this morning at seven o'clock in the morning heading out to work, her first question to me was, what happened since we slept and when we woke up, that's unfolded overseas in these last five, six hours."
That's the laugh of a crazy person.
" So it seems that the blue wall states, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, it's that last one, Pennsylvania, that doesn't seem to be coming along quite as much as the other two."
This is my good friend.
"There's gonna be, when they count the votes, and they do the math, and they're the side of this, I'm convinced you're gonna have a record number of Hispanic and Latino voters coming into the Republican Party, a record number of black and African American voters, record number of Jewish voters and union workers and hardworking families, because they understand the Harris policies have destroyed their family finances."
"How many presidents, how many politicians have come out on stage and hugged the American flag?"
We'll see you again soon.
And she constantly harangs former President Trump and voters still don't know who she is or what she is.
But do I think you could see Trump win the state by like two to three?
"Well, you know, I've been a Democratic strategist for a long time and I've been on Fox a few times on all the shows."
It sounds like you they feel that you really gas is much better than the electric for cooking.
"It is me, Real American, backing up the new video today."
So I started this in 2019.
Any reason that that doesn't work in Pennsylvania for Mehmet Oz?
"Allegheny County, which is in western Pennsylvania, that's where Pittsburgh is, accounts for 10%, or at least accounted for 10% of the 2020 turnout in all of Pennsylvania."
"I mean, I read a so-called Republican who Ronald Reagan didn't like, by the way, and she didn't like him."
"I think it can look, unfortunately, like what it looked like in 2020 with violence in our communities, with threats to public officials, good public officials like Al Schmidt and the Republican and Democratic clerks of elections."
I'm happy to see that come together because he's been down and it doesn't make sense to me.
"It is Harris plus 8, and it was surveyed between August 14th and 17th."
Here's the abortion issue.
"The majority of the nation had an unfavorable view of Kamala Harris, roughly a third of the nation, just a third, had a favorable view of Kamala Harris."
He was the seventh most bipartisan member of Congress during his time in office.
He believes it 100 percent and he is in love with our country.
"And then on the other issues, like, oh, whatever, if, if Republicans say it should be this, then that's what I'm for, right?"
We see how Trump is different from your regular political person who was just an actor at best and not even a good actor.
"You've talked to many of the members of the Cabinet currently, former President Trump, Kamala Harris."
You mentioned Philadelphia.
"The polls are all over the place, especially in Pennsylvania, which could be a make or break state for both candidates."
He is very definitely the favorite.
You don't expect them to say anything but what they're saying.
"Oh, no question about it."
They need to get their head examined.
"You've got multiple wars happening, multiple hot wars that really can get out of control quickly."
"What I will ask you about, my friend, your takeaways from this conversation, what stands out most?"
"NBC News correspondent George Solis joins us now from Reading, Pennsylvania with more on this."
That's exactly.
"I mean, clearly, as you say, there was a very tangible effect from Trump's endorsement of J.D."
But she's run a fairly flawless campaign so far and still isn't budging.
"So she suggested a lower rate of 28 percent as the number for that, because it can help incentivize more investment in entrepreneurs and startups in America."
"My name is Beth Leeper and to play opposite of Nick, I married the farmer's son, who is here today with my two sons Levi and Owen."
Supporters here feel like it's something that could really energize his base of supporters.
"For the purpose of ensuring that Pennsylvania has a diverse voting population, Shapiro believes that this action is of the utmost importance."
"I'll put some graphics on it and re-release it so it's easier to consume because I know on these live streams, sometimes I just ramble a little bit."
Absolutely I want to ask Democrats this election around have been focusing on how Donald Trump is it allegedly a threat to democracy?
I guess you could say.
The Susquehanna missing the final result by two points in either direction for 2016 and 2020.
"And in Michigan, Kamala Harris ahead by two, again, New York Times and Sienna College poll not included on this average here, point being a two-point lead then will likely turn into three-point lead."
"One of them though is perhaps more important than the rest, both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in Pennsylvania yesterday."
"And then... And then this statue of Lucille Ball spoke up and said, Ermiglerd, you're a cur."
So that is a factor.
And this rambler doesn't know when to hold them and when to fold them.
The man was set up quick and easy no musk no fuss on a building right across the way how does that happen?
Former President Trump returned to Pennsylvania for the first time since the attempted assassination of him in western Pennsylvania a few weeks earlier.
I used to run around the city of Philadelphia and just be called racial slurs just by being outside.
And so you have folks that are business owners and are more attracted to Trump.
"Well, last night was a testament to where the voters are remaining today."
It's not the Senate doing this audit.
Trump campaign comparison.
"Unfortunately, I'm going to keep standing up and doing my job defending our elections, defending the voters of Arizona and making sure that their will is upheld in our in our next election."
I'm Eric Fink news for Tucson
"This is Claude McDaniel, and you're watching Streaming News Network."
"The state of democracy itself is another huge talking point, with 70% of voters expressing anxiety over the future of the country's democratic institutions."
"The really word, the word she wants to use there is a centrally planned command and control economy dictated by every, dictating every aspect of your life."
Let's talk about fracking because we're here in Pennsylvania.
"I mean, I think there's three races I'm keeping an eye on where I'm campaigning for these members."
"Now, one of the biggest flaws that people are going to make, or they're going to look at the gubernatorial election results in 2022, 2018, 2014, and think that those could be replicated, but they really can't."
The state and local officials meanwhile are like what are you talking about?
"So we are going, Meghan, to the VFW halls, meeting the veterans where they are."
I do not know what that means.
And here's a picture.
"It's just incredibly, incredibly invaluable."
They're not going to vote on Election Day compared to 2020.
That's all gone.
I go on Teemu and buy garbage.
"So you might think oh, well, maybe 2020 was an outlier but If you look at these Wisconsin polls here these Wisconsin polls I averaged this out It's like three point four for or not three point four This one is I think like five point four or something something around there and then the Wisconsin 2016 results She loses by one point so they're off by like four point four point four or something more than that And then the Pennsylvania numbers here when you look at the Pennsylvania averages here, it's a much much better."
I'm not saying that they possibly can't be underestimating Trump.
"Yeah, you'll see this is shaping up to be a Donald Trump victory."
"Nate Silver calling out Alan Lichtman, actually."
"But when the race is this close, it's hard to really put much stock into any of these numbers."
"Remember, it wasn't just a rejection of these people and their personalities."
But Watkins says Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes should be a factor.
"In many ways, that they're trying to get people to look forward at that."
"And it's an area where you got to compete really, really hard."
That's about a percentage point or less.
"And with Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Walz injecting joy and like to plans, it seems a lot of enthusiasm."
"Is that important to you the sort of last class ceiling, you know Um, just to break that stigma is huge just to even have a woman president Period, you know women haven't been treated equally in this country for a long time and I feel like Kamala Harris, you know She may not be the woman for the job But I do feel like it's time in America that we start listening to black women and what they have to say politically So we're out here today in Pennsylvania ahead of this Trump rally, can you tell me a little bit more about what's that?"
"He was down in Michigan, he was down in Wisconsin."
"When Joe Biden dropped out of the race, Donald Trump led him by 4.5% in the state of Pennsylvania."
"So those things could really come into play to pick off moderate voters, independent voters and undecided voters."
We backed off.
"I mean, one, it's not going to overturn the results of the election."
On the issue of abortion.
But the one thing that we do know is that Donald Trump is the favorite in Pennsylvania.
The fact that they didn't walk in there first.
Biden can't sink.
"Kamala already worked with Joe Biden to take on the drug companies, bring down the cost of insulin, hearing aids, more than 50 prescription drugs."
I mean the red wave is imminent.
This is according to Bloomberg.
I've never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate ever.
The stage is about where it was on the 13th of July.
"Are we to now read that the big money in America, the super PACs are all backing Kamala Harris?"
And that's something that's important to take into consideration.
"For international and national factors affecting Pennsylvania, beyond domestic issues, international events also impact voters in Pennsylvania."
"As recently as 2019, Trump had said, oh, well, maybe we'll reverse that, realizing that the politics around this had been quite heightened."
And McCormick and Trump are on the same page or campaigning together.
They can bring the rank and file union in because they're going to be these temporary jobs funded by tax dollar.
"So what would a the question is, I'm going to bring it up again."
Um.
"Yes, bec a hat."
 The official audit led by the cyber ninja guy began today.
He's got some intensity behind his campaign.
That was like very cool.
This is something that nobody can fathom and the pain is so deep that there's just a numbness to it.
There will be better service for residents.
"So without wasting much time, let's get right into it."
So we definitely don't want Harris in the White House and we want to take the blame when they lose.
"It comes with a 20-year prison sentence, if convicted."
"The top line numbers, the horse race numbers, look pretty good for Kamala Harris, but specifically on the economy, a remarkable turn here to find her essentially tied, certainly within the margin, with Donald Trump on the issue that will likely, for most voters, decide this election."
"In other words, Biden got it back in 2020 after it went for Trump."
"But, you know, what else are you going to take it or leave it?"
"This net zero approach has also increased farm costs exponentially, which I know comes as no surprise to anyone here today."
These are known as the swing states or battleground states.
Let's listen to a sound bite.
"It's like, yeah, this is a state that's going to be very difficult for Democrats to win, especially when you look at who's registering and where the new registrations are going and the Republicans have increased their net party registration advantage by like 220,000 since the 2020 election."
Who knows what they're going to say at the end of the day.
Both campaigns will be in town once again today.
I just love teachers.
Whatever she can to make people try to swing her way so that she can try to get the presidency.
"It's a slow decline, but the thing about it is they are not going to do anything that's going to benefit black people."
"Okay, let's do a couple of questions."
The state's electorate includes a significant number of union members and working-class voters who have historically supported Democratic candidates.
Kamala Harris received 50 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 48 percent.
"So therefore his campaign has always been targeted to specifying particular areas, particular counties in crucial states and focusing their efforts on there."
"I mean, just take a look right here in Delaware County, for example, and this is Delaware County mail ballots."
"And frankly, he's not even on the ballot anymore."
He's leading in every swing state.
"However, we're done for, guys."
He'll probably win that runoff there in the third district.
"That 5-point gap would mark the third straight cycle in which Texas' margin narrows, though it does still go down as leaning towards Trump here."
It's a pretty damning indictment of the campaign strategy or lack thereof.
"But let's see where this goes, because Kamala gets asked about reparations."
The Democrats need to build a firewall before election day if they're going to survive and win in the 2024 election.
It's anybody's game.
Listen to this word salad here.
But it was interesting over the weekend.
I'm calling this Trump's hood.
What the hell do you need to be working for go home?
"Like my in-laws, they like to watch actual cable television and like sitting there, being bombarded with those ads is maddening, especially, I think when we're watching the Phillies game, every single commercial break is just, it's literally Trump ad, Kamala ad, Dave McCormick ad, Bob Casey ad, then whoever the congressional candidate is, I'm like, I'm gonna lose my goddamn mind."
"So spending a lot of time there, Democrats are both the surrogates and the candidates, and I'm going to continue to do everything I can to help there."
"Why he's fixated on our looks, but most importantly, guys, his inability to pivot is actually kind of stunning."
"And if you want gas, great."
"I remember after the home mortgage crisis, Kamala pushed me and my administration harder than any other Attorney General in the country, to make sure homeowners got a fair settlement."
"You have these two counties, Erie, Northampt like you had in twenty twenty three."
Trump is trusted more than Harris to handle immigration by a margin of 55% to 38%.
And then getting in and then ruining it all point So people have to register to get in and so even McCain running for president or it never matter No one has ever come.
These like the biting years.
Is there any evidence that suggests that he in fact was trying to do that?
"And so while it's true that this election, it's not over."
"You know, who gets excited about this kind of stuff?"
How many can they pick up beyond a majority?
"But you've heard what he said through those people about the military, about wounded veterans, about Normandy."
"And then you were at this rally that the new Vice Presidential nominee, Tim Walz, and Vice President participated in Philadelphia and it certainly seemed to be allowed an enthusiastic crowd."
"The Trump campaign, let's start there, claims that it was hacked."
You would probably anticipate Donald Trump to do better.
"How is that possible, Kamala?"
And we passed the strongest bill in the nation to make sure that only women could play in women's sports.
Or how about 58 would be.
"He contrasted this with figures such as Ohio Senator G.D. Vance, who, despite obtaining endorsements from union leadership, has struggled to connect with the individuals he claims to serve."
"Join me today as the Center Squares Pennsylvania editor, Kristen Smith."
"In 2024, several key issues are likely to drive voter behavior in Michigan."
"And now, and so like it was all this fear mongering, but like this is a perfect example of just how absurd it actually is."
The finish line is in sight.
You've got Antonio Brown-Levion Bell out campaigning for Trump at rallies.
Have you seen him lately?
So it makes no sense.
"It's been around for a long time, actually started in the 1940s, but it really became a huge industry in the United States beginning in 2005."
Thank you very much.
"However, Trump shows that he remains highly competitive by winning in two polls and tying in two polls."
It's just what I'm saying.
And I couldn't see the methodology of Rasmussen in terms of the demographics of what they polled in the Rasmussen poll either.
There's an actual FBI wanted poster for the swords and daggers.
Harris finished 1 point ahead of Trump in this poll.
"Ugh, that's not good for them because they need to win Pennsylvania."
I think she had been in our Commonwealth.
"We can take a look at Michigan, for instance, where Harris now leads by two points."
"And voters, even in red states, even in states where Democrats are not expected to win, have come out and voted consistently in support of abortion rights."
"Like I don't know how you explain it, bro."
"""'You can't wear jeans at the Olive Garden, but they're my nice dark jeans."
And I think more people want elected officials who understand the day to day needs of working class Americans.
And I think that's a good kind of target demo for her to kind of squeeze out a couple more votes as we're looking at a really close race.
He went as far as saying that he wished the driver had been a white man.
That's better than wasting a lot of words.
Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged and he is out for unchecked power.
"Going back to this 2016, because we're 2020 back."
"Democracy is not the word I would use, but a theater show of an attempt to steal an election or at the very least to sow significant doubts in our election system."
And I think we will.
Democrats back Harris 95 to 4 percent.
He believes he can turn anything into gold.
And it's significant because that was passed by a bipartisan legislature.
"But either way, what's more likely these undecided voters to break for Trump or break for Harris?"
"However, in the 2020 US presidential elections, Joe Biden won the electoral votes in Pennsylvania with 1.17% more votes than Trump."
"Why is it so impo people to vote, especiall of this election?"
And we make more money.
But these issues are cropping up.
"And then you've got all the talk about AI and automation, maybe taking away jobs."
It is time to call on God's army that is armed with our voices and our vote.
Republicans and Democrats making sure that everything is fair.
This is something that voters continuously say they trust her more than Donald Trump on.
I hope they see jackpot and I hope they're entertained.
"And don't forget to click the red Subscribe button below to get more of News Nation's fact-driven, unbiased coverage."
"Kamala Harris represents a path forward, a path towards a more just and equitable society, where every voice is heard and valued."
"There's a lot of policies out there from Kamala Harris that she says that she is going to boost the economy with, boost the country with, stimulate people's bank accounts with."
Okay so because there are so like 43% of all the votes cast in this entire state are coming from this section and this section that means there are a lot of voters in those areas which means it takes much longer to actually count those votes so it's always late into the evening Allegheny will come in first in Pennsylvania and all of the sudden the numbers in the blue column start shooting up and then when the numbers over in this area come in the numbers will continue to go up.

Favorability ratings 48% favorable opinion of Harris while 43 unfavorable.
And they are doing this because they think they are going to find some smoking gun that Donald Trump actually won Maricopa County.

Why is her campaign focusing on this voting group?
"Kamala Harris is either ahead by three or four points, and that maintains the average that now shows Kamala Harris leading in the state of Pennsylvania."

"I'm loving, I'm like a campaign, get her out there more."
There it is.
"It's not everything, which I'm not denying."
Very sad but also it looks like we're coming to an end with this.
Still same concept.
"If they can't get over this and get through it, they'll lose again."
The last presidential election was decided by less than a percentage point.
And if they are that they're not being counted correctly.
"And so, OK, we've talked about the cultural aspect of things, but let's talk money for a second, because you're a top member of the Harris campaign's finance team."

I'm not sure that Harris.
But every other county is where his margin slipped.
We were told that here in Maricopa County which is the largest county by far in Arizona its Phoenix and its suburbs is what it includes is that they can run about six to eight thousand ballots an hour.
Remember 2020?
And therefore it's going to take a lot more time and obviously a lot more money for him.

They are at some point defiant.
Pretty disgusted.
"I want to take you now out to Philadelphia, where at any moment we will be getting an update from the President Trump campaign."
So we've seen a trend from the beginning of Donald Trump.
I'm going to have to go back to the airport.
"Vice president Dick Cheney, his daughter, Congresswoman Liz Cheney, just yesterday, the former Bush attorney general, Alberto Gonzalez, endorsing her candidacy."

Senate leadership should be ashamed.

Far more Democrats and Republicans vote by mail in Pennsylvania.
They're these guys.

Obviously Bob Casey Jr.
"Well, I don't think some people understand how truly important Pennsylvania is, especially for the Trump campaign, because I really believe if Trump suffers a defeat in Pennsylvania, his pathway to the presidency is all but gone."
"It's going to be another 10, 20, 30,000 vote race."

But the other guy's just melted ice cream.
"You have to win Arizona, Nevada, and then Michigan."
"Harris aims to secure support in urban areas with large black populations, while Trump focuses on white, non-college-educated voters."
This election is a battle for small business.
"More is being found out and uncovered every single day, not only in Arizona, but all over the country."
I do think it's important that we remember that the map looks really different from 2008.
"And I think that's what is top of mind for so many residents, not only in Dearborn, all across the globe."
"You have to build a coalition of Democrats, Republicans and independents to win this state."
Oh my gosh She's fantastic.
"The one thing that voters here in Pennsylvania respect is when you show up, you look them in the eye, you tell them the truth and you listen."
Biden won Arizona.
"I understand just how critical jobs in the natural gas industry are here in this commonwealth, particularly for our building trades in the southwestern part of our state and elsewhere."
"Dylan, welcome."
"What are you hearing about our current president, President Biden?"
"We're living in you know what I'm saying, but when I say that I want to make it clear I'm not saying that that was fake, but you best believe in the blogosphere in this internet era Individuals are most definitely saying that here We go everybody with the Donald Trump staged a shooting just to win the election First of all Donald Trump would definitely stage a shooting with fake blood and all that just to win the election Absolutely, I agree with that But think about it He would have to fake out the CIA the United States government is going to take every resource and asset They're going to make sure that this was real if it was fake they're gonna find out So you'd have to know that I am a fake out the CIA."
Inflation is an issue.
This crowd is 90% gone from the seating area.
"They're yelling in the direction at us, yelling in the direction of authorities but they are emptying out."
He leads practically every single one of them.

"You can take this, right?"
They don't.
"They said the reason the crowd booed Trump when he said Kamala was an attractive woman is because to them, anyone of color can't be attractive."
So what can you tell us about this region and this county?
Watch his rallies.
And he sees Kamala Harris as more liberal than he would like.
"We are going to be talking about three battleground state polls, one state in particular, Pennsylvania, that has seen the New York Times, Quinnipiac University, and Franklin and Marshall College in three consecutive days."
But it turned out to be a hefty house cat.
"But as you hit on Connell, these counties are so important."
And Harris was terrible on Fox News the other night.
Give this a watch.
But here are some of the comments.
"Trump's campaign is also heavily focused on Pennsylvania, criticizing Harris on economic issues and trying to shape her image among voters."
They've not been very sophisticated.
It has.
"She might improve marginally, but it's not going to be enough to offset her point of weakness with a lot of these working-class white voters in the state that somebody in a tumultuous time like Joe Biden, he'd probably be able to get enough of them to hold on."
Son.
She's going to be tied to the Biden record regardless of what she says or what she does.
"In fact, she may do worse in some places."
"Libby Cathy, for us, always excellent reporting and analysis."
We're at 20 minutes.
Perhaps the most dramatic development in Pennsylvania is Harris's surge in suburban areas.
That's a good question.
We've been to so many Trump events.
"I mean, in the month of August, Republicans gained 21000 voters."
"Well, let's just say by some miracle, the polls don't matter."
"It's unclear, Chanel."
Voter registration isn't everything.
"It was packed and now when we just saw you recently, you know, you can see that that area has been cleared."
"And many people rallying behind Trump's election lies are conspiracy theorists like Vinchem, who have ties or even official members of extremist groups like the Oath Keepers."
There's momentum for Harris.
Does that mean it's going to trend fifteen points Republican?
But it is also different.
"Ozzy Pabara, thank you so much."
Even when some of these other counties swing.
He's gonna be the oldest president in American history at the end of this next term if he gets to serve it.
"Top Democrats in Pennsylvania, critical swing state, are worried."
"Running against Kamala Harris, not Joe Biden, and he doesn't seem to understand that."
"Jill Stein is getting 1% in Pennsylvania, 2% in Michigan and 1% in Wisconsin."
They're concerned about the jobs that they have today being there tomorrow.
Can I just say you are the first person who's asked about my community this entire week.
He just did the other day on the Team Trump Facebook page.
Is this something they're going to support?
"Reid, who has significant investments in renewable energy, supports Harris' commitment to combating climate change through clean energy initiatives."
"I think she is not only doing a great job of kind of getting the band back together, right, getting the coalition back together."
I'm not a Democrat.
"But I find that so unlikely just for the simple fact it hasn't happened in Pennsylvania in 2020 or 2016, when Trump's on the ballot every year."
Everybody tune in because it's time to address something.
"All right, Jake, so in recent hours, Trump's been dealing with more questions, more talk and discussion over his cognitive health, comes as his campaign is really ramping up efforts to appeal to younger male voters."
"You're looking at Nydia Cavazos in Detroit, following the Harris campaign on the left."
Do you have any questions you'd like to ask?
Still decisive.
You're talking about substantive issues.
"We have a lot of natural gas, just like Saudi Arabia has oil."
"Okay, Congressman Chris Deluzio, thank you so much for the conversation, sir."
So I've actually been canceled pretty much from the visionary culture.

Now we have a new poll from the New York Times with Sienna College this is an A plus rated pollster apparently the best the best even though their polls are all over the place that this election season but they show Kamala Harris with a four point lead when you don't round out the results over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania when you round these are the numbers that they give us it is 50% for Kamala Harris 47% for Donald Trump a three point lead when rounded when you unround Trump falls down to 46% which gives her a very impressive four point lead in Pennsylvania and you will look at why this four point lead is so important not to mention Arizona of course while we have this poll up Donald Trump really expanding his lead in Arizona to now a 6% margin very impressive for him but we you know we really have had this common consensus now for quite a while now for months now that Donald Trump will carry the state of Arizona as well as other Sun Belt states but Pennsylvania is the important one here Arizona only has 11 electoral votes Pennsylvania has 19 in such a close race like this that eight more from Pennsylvania sorry yeah eight more on that really does matter a lot so that four point lead is important because we always talk about you know how much are the polls overestimated Joe Biden in the 2020 election right because when you look at 2020 he was expected to win by only four point seven percent and I say only because take that with with a state like Wisconsin in 2020 where Joe Biden was expected to win in the polls on election day by eight point four percent he only won it by point six so he was overestimated basically eight percent almost in the state of Wisconsin while you head over to Pennsylvania again he was expected to win by four point seven he won it by one point two so he was only over estimated here by some three and a half percent so to see Kamala Harris with the four point lead on rounded in Pennsylvania that's big because I do want to preface this with saying that I don't think that Kamala Harris will be overestimated in the polls at all I currently think that she will be underestimated in the polling so even if she is overestimated as much as Joe Biden was in the 2020 election in Pennsylvania she still wins again Biden was overestimated by three and a half percent in Pennsylvania when you do the math Harris has a four point lead currently she would still win the state by a very narrow margin so Pennsylvania is hugely important right you know so that was just to show you know how important this single poll is considering that it isn't a plus pollster but now we have to talk about Pennsylvania because the fact that the fact the matter is she is running away with Pennsylvania it's a very narrow lead um in in of court like the average I'm in the aggregate of polls um which is expected and again I don't I do think that Harris will outpace what polls are expecting I really do because poll stars are pollsters are worried about underestimating the Trump factor once again and everything like that so they are really boosting Trump's are they're giving an emphasis on Trump areas because they're you know the polling industry is you know going down right now in the dumps um so again they're really trying to get it accurate this time not underestimate Trump ultimately I think that Harris is being underestimated now just like 2022 the Democrats were but when it comes to the average you can see Harris has never let up once in the state of Pennsylvania that's insane that is absolutely insane Harris has kept a lead in Pennsylvania this entire race now let's compare that to a state like North Carolina for a moment we see we see um in the beginning of the race Trump had a pretty steady lead then Harris took the lead for a moment there for literally like two days then he was even then Trump took the back the lead then it was even again Trump took the lead Harris took the lead by point to Trump took the lead Harris took the lead Trump took the lead again Harris took the lead Trump took the lead and he still has the lead less than 1% this is the case and this is the most extreme case but this is a case that's going that's happening with many many many battleground states Michigan not Michigan sorry Wisconsin Nevada especially Arizona Georgia for sure but what you notice is that it's not happening in Pennsylvania and that's important the fact that there is a common consensus in the polling numbers is important fact that common layers is a clear leader is a clear favorite to win in Pennsylvania that's important let's just take a look at at the 538 forecast here let's I don't know what they are currently projected to be honest um they say that the presidential race is extremely narrow but I assume they say of course that Harris is favored to win in Pennsylvania you can see there she has a 52 to 48 percent chance of winning the state but looking at Pennsylvania specifically again it is so incredibly important that Kamala Harris does have a lock on Pennsylvania that's what I've been saying for a while when you look at the electoral map Pennsylvania proves to be extremely important this is my forecast that's the map these are all the numbers this is how I think that the election will go if it were held today or tomorrow or whatever so Pennsylvania is critical obviously to Kamala Harris on now if Trump does win Pennsylvania Kamala Harris actually still wins the election however she then has literally zero wiggle room the only place that she could lose is Nebraska second district resulting in her still winning the election even if she loses just Nevada on top of that you know just two slight changes in my forecast then she loses the election 267 to 271 however however North Carolina is basically toss-up I have a Harris plus 0.1 percent because I don't know it's too hard to tell there are too many factors Mark Robinson being on the ballot the state shifting left rapidly right now there are so many factors to consider North Carolina it's virtually toss-up I think that Harris wins by honestly a few thousand votes so look I would not be surprised in the slightest if Trump wins North Carolina because the odds really are 50-50 in my forecast right now considering that margin of Harris plus 0.1 so if North Carolina does go red which you say I'm on a chance that it goes red as it goes blue then she can't lose Pennsylvania then she has to hold Pennsylvania so the fact that she as I outlined she is you know she has this sort of lock on Pennsylvania right now as she has had throughout this race that's important because it is critical to her path to victory then if she holds Pennsylvania she could even lose Nevada Nevada could even go to Donald Trump and it could still result in a 270 win for Harrison walls 270 is the minimum you need to win the presidency that is just two electoral votes up against Trump and Vance so North Carolina and Nevada could easily go Republican but as long as she has Pennsylvania she wins the election and she holds the other blue wall states now what if Trump wins Pennsylvania it's you know obviously it's important to Harris's victory but if Trump is going to win the election of course I really think that you know he might need Pennsylvania however that he doesn't need it he could he could simply just run the Sun Belt North Carolina Georgia Arizona Nevada and then flip Wisconsin I think that Wisconsin will be closer than Pennsylvania so that of course can absolutely happen but if Pennsylvania does go red it really opens the door for Donald Trump if he wins the Sun Belt plus Pennsylvania he's at 287 17 more than he needs then he could even lose North Carolina and he still wins the election or he could actually lose he could even lose Nevada and Arizona and he still wins the election 270 to 268 so you know Pennsylvania everything weighs on Pennsylvania almost Donald Trump and Kamala Harris still paths to victory especially Trump Trump still has a path to victory without Pennsylvania however Pennsylvania is one of the most likely states to go to either candidate because of how split it is right now so it's very good for Kamala Harris when she gets polls like this which shows her from an A plus pollster with a pretty steady lead in the most critical battleground state Pennsylvania and again I think that she will win it Joe Biden won it by 1.2% in 2020 and what we have seen is a massive left-word trend in the suburbs the suburbs that dominate Pennsylvania elections and we are seeing massive left-ward trends across suburbs or in suburbs across the nation so if Pennsylvania can continue to trend to the left then the Democrats are in for a really good result in Pennsylvania so look at this Chester County Pennsylvania vote for Mitt Romney in 2012 by 0.2% he lost the state Obama won the state by 5% fast forward four years later Chester County went from 0.2 for Romney to 10 for Hillary Clinton now Donald Trump won the state so while the state as a whole trended seven points or six points I should say towards the Republicans Chester County became ten points more Democratic that you never see furthermore he went from ten points in 2016 to a stunning 17 points for Biden in 2020 suburbs eight Donald Trump and I believe that now more than ever with someone like Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket for the Democrats she will be able to really continue this trend possibly you know trend it more these at least Chester County trend it more towards the Democrats than we have seen in past elections in 2016 and 2020 so that's the state of the race right now in Pennsylvania hugely important state Kamala Harris definitely favored to win so thank you all

"So again, the tie here in our new poll, Trump versus Harris, and put that side by side with the last time we checked in on this race when it was a five-point Harris advantage."
I've done multiple streams going over that poll.
"He is, however, Jewish."
Change his tire.
Donald Trump on the other hand turned his event into a dance party yesterday after two people suffered medical emergencies at the event.
Thanks very much for being with us.
Jerry Flynn.
"So again, 2020 was decided by 80,000."
And I think the messaging was very interesting in terms of Kamala Harris.
"I've said for a while now, watch his rallies."
They always go to the fake news.
"Please welcome City Clerk for the City Council of Pittsburgh, Kimberly Clark-Baskin."
The people love him.
So that means it was so valuable to them.
"No, you lose weight."
"So this was a significant rally and you know at a time where there's been a lot of scrutiny, a lot of focus on who that could have been."
"But shortly into her volunteer observer shift to watch the counters who are handling all the real ballots, reporter Jen Fifield noticed something that seemed quite wrong going on in terms of the way this is being conducted."
"And ultimately, I think that is what's going to guide their vote for Kamala Harris."
"And these are the counties that are in southeastern Pennsylvania, right outside of Philadelphia."
"Well, you're my name is Derek."
This means the tabulation equipment counted the ballots as they were designed to do.
"You know, a lot of people around the world do not know that lobbying in American politics is pretty much legal."
And so what I've seen her doing is she didn't answer the question.
And we've become the overreach.
And then you have these other candidates.
"It was Biden plus five, Clinton plus seven, plus eight."
"The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, said, no one has ever been more dangerous to this country than Donald Trump, and he is a fascist to his core."
He's listening to you right now.

"Do what it takes to keep our farms producing, our markets selling and our customers buying."
Let's talk about fracking.
It's really notable because this is the first time the Trump or Vance Trump has not been to Pittsburgh.
So I think it's a very important question.
Nobody did.
"Then they went for Biden, but narrowly in 2020 in a lot of places."
I had four interviews with Joe Biden during the 2020 election.
"Tim Ryan was one of the few who challenged Nancy Pelosi, J.D."
So I take it real seriously.
"Tensions with China, Pennsylvania is a state with a large manufacturing industry, and trade wars with China have directly impacted the state's economy."
"Even if it's Dems plus one, it's still good for Republicans because of the way the electoral math works."
"Nancy, good morning."
"Let's, let's be serious."
"But still, the fact is, is that the polls are close."
"As Amar Moussa says, Trump is in deep trouble in Pennsylvania."
"He came from a purple district, a Trump district."
Biden?
They gained .43% on net in the mail-in drop today.

"You don't have to agree, but I want you to look in my eyes."
"What do you think of the tone of the ads you're seeing, whether Republican, Democrat or other?"
Three other names that have been tied to the VP pick.
Will Pennsylvania go red or blue this time?
We all know that.

"So, I mean, in all seriousness, that whole thing about Trump thinking he's still president and importantly telling his supporters that the fraud has been proven and Biden's only pretending to be president and he got there based on a crime."
And that's the sad part.
They told her.
That is what Republicans have unleashed on Vice President Harris.
"Shapiro stated that Trump, who at his first campaign portrayed himself as a defender of the working class, has failed to deliver on critical vows, which has caused him to lose ground among the same followers who supported him in the first campaign."
More bulletproof glass and other things.
Many attendees had traveled from neighboring states eager to hear Trump speak and show their unwavering support.
The Trump campaign's success in Pennsylvania is also indicative of a broader trend in the 2024 election cycle.
"And even that in certain States, I mean, because a lot of it, a lot of the pandemic was a state to state thing."
I know you've interviewed her as well.
"Foreign policy can get you in trouble as a presidential candidate, but seldom does it win you votes."
So our members vote on local candidates.
There has been always a political tension between Governor Ron DeSantis and this White House over the past three and a half years.
"And look, Erie's also had some economic challenges over the last several years."
"Typically, more of the early vote is Republican as it goes on."
"So in a statement, the former president called out Republican State Senator Paul Boyer, accusing him of trying to hold up the audit."
And Trump himself has said that he's going to put a moratorium on all federal grants when he gets in office if he is elected.
You will not regret it.
Challenge yourself and question everything.
They are left wing cope.
But that's not true.
He will score two to three points to win it.
"And I've made my position very publicly clear on this issue, and I will continue to do so."
His longshot bid was rejected from the ballot because the GOP aligned electors backing his candidacy didn't meet requirements.
"With our last 30 seconds, what advice would you give someone who said they wanted to go into public life given this environment?"
You look like a guy who could smell weed smoke on a teenager's clothes from like three blocks away.
"As far as Michigan goes, let's be very clear."
"But yet again, it was because of pollsters like Sussacuan, Trafalgar, insider advantage, having Trump slightly ahead."
"And the second thing, especially for our seniors, is that Donald Trump, we're going to eliminate taxes on social security so that our seniors can afford to live a good life."
"It's reasonable to believe that Michigan could go back to Kamala Harris in this circumstance, too."
"This shift can be attributed to several factors, including the state's demographics and economic concerns, particularly in the manufacturing and energy sectors.Ohio's electorate is predominantly white, with African Americans making up about 12 percent of the population, mostly concentrated in urban areas like Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati."
"Their message of unity, progress, and opportunity resonated with Pennsylvanians looking for leadership that reflects their values and aspirations."
These are the fake news.
"Or in the morning, I get a chicken biscuit with a hash brown and some strawberry jelly."
"And apparently the United States, because Ukraine doesn't have the technology, they really don't have the technology for any of this."
We are here to send a clear message.
It' family.
"And that's going to be a huge factor, whether you're a Trump supporter, whether you're a Biden supporter, and specifically, as we talked about, for those undetermined voters."
The 14th poll was conducted by Morning Consult between September 19 and 25 with 924 likely voters.
" Joe Biden has joined Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania for a campaign rally, one of the must-win states."
You could not make this stuff up.
"And that also was brought up in other conversations, both with him and with John Eastman and others."
"Well, there's no question that the road back to the White House leaves right through the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
You don't get two chances with anybody named Lady Ruby.
"If you win Pennsylvania, you're in a really good situation, especially if you're Trump, if you're Harris."
People lost everything.
"She will continue, allow it to continue."
Our great reporters are back with us.
"People who are likely going to vote for Joe Biden are now not only voting for Kamala Harris, but they're also taking lawn signs, putting them on their lawn."
"OK, and so Republicans, they banking their vote is absolutely critical."
It sounds racist as hell to me but this is Kamala.
"Inside her advantage, you know, John Wick Trafalgar Mitchell Research."
"He said, you know, this is not somebody who can take this seat in November."
"We continue to bring more people into the fold to reach across the aisle and bring more people into the conversation, and that's what the surrogates for Harrison balls are doing."
"But even, for example, R. Chris Krebs, who's a CBS News cyber security analyst, used to run CISA, which is the big cyber security agency, did it for the Trump administration, pointed out that there had been concerns about sort of hack and leak instances, where you might see someone hack into some kind of an email account or website and then start pushing out information, what he called malinformation."
"I remember the stories about getting John Thurman elected and how many people brought buses to Pennsylvania to get people on board, drive them to the polling station."
"Now, of course, they say he didn't really lose."
"Well, for starters, no, this lead that she has a quotations, it's because of one poll, one poll that found Harris up by five points."
That's going to be a hundred miles long.
We need to get back to common sense economic and governing principles so that the American people can afford to live a good life.
Take a photo.
"Manufacturers have said that too and Donald Trump is saying, whoa, not so fast."
"He said, engines are very expensive."
"Even though this woman has no connections to the black community, grew up in Berkeley, other than Canada, doesn't have a foundational black American family."

He just has to shift the entire state of Pennsylvania into his column.
"You know, if passes prologue, yes."
"We've been the epicenter of this for 248 years, ever since one of my predecessors, Ben Franklin walked out after signing the constitution to the cobblestone streets of Philadelphia."
And it's very possible that Trump ends up taking the state by more than people expect if this holds.
So the campaign is certainly trying to find ways for her to continue to message on this.
The impression that I get is my Song of the Day.
Cowardly.
But there's a big catch to that.
"It's an uphill battle for her there, but she at least keeps herself in the game by saying I'm not going to ban fracking."
Good.
That could be the real kickoff.
Now she's backing off on them a little bit like she's doing with fracking because she wants to get elected.
"We are making a concerted effort, not only going to these service plazas to reach the truckers in Pennsylvania, setting up a voter registration table."
And not just Harris plus one.
"And it's important to note, she's running against Karen Taylor Robeson, who has spent more than $18 million compared to Carrie Lake's $3 million."
"Couple of things that stand out behind that, right?"
He's on the slander.

"I'd rather not see hundreds of millions, maybe even billions of people roasted alive in nuclear fire."

"And so this has been a very troubling, sort of a troubling pattern that I think the relationship between kind of politics and extremism seems to have gotten stronger since January 6th, not weaker."
It's almost like an inversion of the two parties general election problems.
"Well, I would put it this way."
"And, you know, I was thinking, why is he kind of going after New York?"
It's not just about having resources.
She's looking very fancy with the hoop earrings.
"So Erie is was the home forever in a day of the New Deal, the coalition of Democrats."
"It just completely flipped again I have personally have no idea why they're basically the same person but What ended up happening was, you know politically at least right Paul policies was but what happened was like, oh, yeah No, I'm good now."
"And once more, the Tar Heel state is poised to support the former president."
"The states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio will be central to determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election."
Hit subscribe.
The Georgia and DC cases likely aren't happening before the election either.
What's the feeling on the ground?
We like the fact that the Republican nominee for president is letting gas on stage.
"I'm talking to an influencer, a young mover and shaker in this movement as John Legend is singing Prince and Sheila E. is on the drums."
Good morning to our friends at the rundown.
It's better than money.
We'll see how Kamala lies about that tomorrow.
I feel like a lot of it's been more directed towards Walls.
"Trump, meanwhile, you can see him right here behind us, behind bulletproof glass."
He's got the Trump Bible.
We don't have to say it.
This is arguably the ultimate swing state in this election And every vote will count.
Why is Harris made such strides in the suburbs?
"It's influencing their choices in the polls, and both candidates know it."
"And with Harris only recently becoming the Democratic nominee, voters say they want to hear more about her policy proposals."
It also seems to be a process that is not being conducted the way that other recounts have been conducted.
"No, I haven't."
He's leading the polls in Quinnipiac.
"Yeah, gender gap."
"And, Christine and Megan, great question because in our next hour, during the five o'clock hour, we are going to specifically ask a Republican, a Democrat, and an undecided, how important is the economy to you?"
"You have made false claims about some of your rivals from Nikki Haley to former President Barack Obama, saying they weren't born in the United States, which is not true."
Thanks so much.
That's what Politico is reporting.
He's endorsed Dr. Mehmet Oz.
Does it's a complete mess?
"She is definitely, she's had four years to do it."
He's the clear favorite even in Wisconsin.
Jesse.
"They've also chosen to take leadership roles in Penn's Democratic group, juggling schoolwork with driving voter turnout, canvassing and meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris."

Local media has reported the explosion was caused by a bomb carried by the lone fatality.
"And that means no blade movement, more comfort before and after shaving."
"Furthermore, we have provided logs pursuant to these subpoenas from the Arizona State Senate that if the cyber ninjas knew what they were looking at, they would see that these logs establish that these machines were never connected to the Internet."
"He, as you know, is, uh, appears to be not well."
"So when you have these super PACs who are investing so much in the campaign of Kamala Harris, now there is going to be a lot of interest in knowing as to who is backing Kamala Harris at this moment."
This doesn't happen all the time in Amish country.
"As you know, he has very high unfavorable ratings, as well as that strong base of support from his backers."
I think that creating that sense of a community amongst voters to get them engaged and get them out to the polls is going to be super important.
And she's the only one who called Trump winning in Pennsylvania.
"The sun is rising on the southern border near Sassebay, Arizona, illuminating this glaring gap."
And the Rasmussen poll has Trump plus three and that's going to have to be inputted because they do input that they put in.
The economy was higher inflation was lower things were better overall and now with Kamala's Administration things haven't been so fantastic and she's saying she can fix the problems that her administration has caused But I just don't know if I can afford to take that risk Were you leaning towards the former president coming in tonight?
"I'm on one side, David McCormick's on the other."
This is a high profile election.
"But Pennsylvania, the one with maybe just a little bit of a lead for the former president, that is critical because the former president would only need to take one of these states."
This is a tough state to compete in and win in.
But what's this about?
You know that better than anybody.
I will re-release this video.
As Republicans?
That's all I could say about it.
Her mouth was so foul.
Some people have been waiting here for two days for this.
I can't see anybody else.
"Before we leave you, I have to ask you about this."
"What, 25 years now."
"Well, that gives a huge advantage to Republicans."

"Yeah, Emerson found Trump with a small lead."
More and more people started to dislike Kamala Harris.
Yeah?
"You know, comedians, they can say what they want because they're just being funny, but they're sliding that truth in there."
This is the stuff you read about in history books never did I ever think in my lifetime that would happen in real time let alone read it on twitter sitting in a driveway.
What are the songs we're getting?
And that is what I want to see in a president of the United States of America.
"Oh wait, it just flipped."
Same thing goes for the whole Madison Square Garden thing.
"Then the polls are close and the Republicans and the Democrats have spent a lot of time, money and energy in Pennsylvania trying to get the state to swing their way."
The thirteenth poll was conducted between September 19th and 25 by morning consult with 924 likely voters.
"But the bottom line is, is that Republicans, their turnout's up in the mail-in vote and the Democrats are down."
"I mean, come on."
"On the other hand, here's Governor Walz."
How do you think they're going to vote?
The battle for Pennsylvania is intensifying with each passing day.
And we'll move on.
We'll have a contest.
"You know, I hope this time we have better luck."
"I mean, this Arizona recount, what a waste of money."
This is the best case that can be made for the election was stolen.
It could be a worrying sign for the Democrats because they need mail-in voting to run up the score as in-person.
Give us a sense as to what is the White House's early reaction.
And that's going to do it for the morning agenda today.
"In addition to the failure of the Trump administration to deliver a comprehensive health care plan, promote sustained job creation, and rebuild the nation's infrastructure, Shapiro was critical of Trump's record for a number of other reasons as well."
And he's always been my man.
She has been making this clear for a long time.
But I'm not sure yet that it's really sunk in.
He'll be a dictator on day one.
"And folks know that Vice President Harris has been part of administrations, been standing up for working people and standing up for folks' freedom."
I'll put it right here.
So can you talk about what you learned this week?
"And I think for most of them, they would say no, because groceries are too high, rent is too high, the border has been opened, our public safety has gotten worse, violent crime has gotten worse."
These are not traditional places that Republicans go.
This is not a drill.
"Yeah, I mean, it's only recently that he's like regained his power of speech."
Don't mess with the movement of America.
"It was very contentious, but it was a state that Republicans had focused on."
That doesn't happen.
We have a replacement for the machines.
What made you decide to come out?
The links on the community tab.
"That's your opinion, ace."
And I think that is also why I am proud and I do have the support of the Steel Workers Union.
"So you're going to see the Harris campaign, the Trump campaign focusing on different areas."
"How have the voters you've talked to reacted to because this is a part of Vice President Harris's economic message, how have they reacted more broadly to that message?"
"Meanwhile, a New York Times-Siana poll now shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in three key battleground states."
It is that important to me because these are people who go out every single day and work hard to keep us safe.
So we kind of have something set up already for us.
"They think they're smarter than you and that they can sell you a line and a story, and that's not President Trump."
"And I remember Cenk talking to me about like, Biden's gonna drop out this weekend."
"He's not going to win Pennsylvania by 15 points, but."
These are new voters.
That is how we can vote 10 times the legal way.
I think that's fair to say.
"Once more, Joe Biden was competitive in these states, but he lost them by about the same margin as Clinton lost four years ago."
"Anyways, do we all realize how serious of a situation that was?"
And they also want labor to come out.
"I do think Nevada has probably got a higher chance than Arizona, but even Arizona, I would say around a 60% chance Trump wins it."
They call it occupied.
And we can expect an all-out battle in the coming weeks as they make their final pitches to voters.
"Don't say that, you stupid son of a bitch."
"So pretty quickly, the people inside of the polling center here or the people inside of the processing center asked them to wear masks, asked them for their credentials, told them that, you know, that space was limited inside, but wanted to talk to them outside."
Former President Donald Trump is holding a town hall with Latino voters.
He's stumbling over his words.
That's a lot.
"Alexa, why should I vote for Kamala Harris?"
"One line from the memo that really stuck with me was she said, quote, please give us the tools to win for as we all know, you do not win P.A."
We're going to ask how this psychopath was able to get from Ukraine down as a Western foreign fighter.
"Valentino Pier and started this whole show, this whole episode, this journey, this adventure at the Valentino Pier in Brooklyn, insight of the Statue of Liberty."

So I wouldn't run away from that.
"And they want to build 3,000 more independent pharmacies as well as make efforts to keep current ones open."
"Wow, AWOL, away without leave."
I will never believe that.
Link to that is always in the description.
"The public's perception of her as a candidate, along with her ability to forge authentic connections with voters, will play a critical role in determining turnout and overall support."
She has plenty of resources to be able to communicate her message.
"And that isn't what's happening here with Kamala Harris, but it certainly is really good news that the Harris campaign is up four points in these states that truly are going to be the most important."
"Now, there is not."
It's like Trump's leading Wisconsin by 0.4.
So you had dozens of Republicans that were endorsed her.
"In 2017, when he imposed this cap, this was one of the revenue raisers they had to offset the big tax cut bill."
Portrait right there.
"Right, and making that argument is pretty tricky."
"If I'm Democrats, the one thing they have an advantage on for issues and the one new thing that's been happened since Trump left office, abortion, you got to press that."
"And so now delving further into these last seven states, we will begin with Arizona, a state Trump lost in the last election."
Every place she's touched has turned to fucking.
But what do you guys think?
"We want to talk to you Pennsylvania politics, too."

Amanda hopes there's a world where she can soon call the GOP home again.

"Let's see who's not just reporting and the volume of content they're reporting on, but look and see who was editing photography, who was adding color grading and filtered effects to photography, who was altering these images and focused points within them to make the content seem more anthemic than it actually is."
He is better at that stuff.
It's almost the opposite.
Gibbs called Trump the greatest president.
"Remember, it was he who packed the Supreme Court so that they would overturn Roe v. Wade and it was he who ran to the microphones to claim credit for it."

The rest of the week is not yet known.
"And it makes sense if you're supporting the interests of the health insurance industry, right?"
And the only way to do it is to work our rear ends off for the next two weeks.
"That was the only place they could find shade sucking in the fumes from the diesel generators, the fetid porta potties."
"It means that you're already at a majority and that people just moving over narrowly between now and the election can put you over that majority denying any chance that Donald Trump would win by a plurality, vote splitting, whatever it might be."
Kamala Harris received 48% of the vote and Donald Trump 45%.
"If you look at what the Arizona Republican Party's been doing, not just, you know, terribly recently since the election, but over the past several years, they've really been doubling down and doubling down and doubling down yet again on the most fervent part of their right wing base."
It's true because she's even less of a solid candidate to appeal to these people in terms of that demographic.
This is not good for Harris at all because if Republicans are now picking up steam and early voting and now this drops.
"And that happened on at least two occasions, that interchange in the conversation."
Will you be there?
"Not only is there a great deal of time between the surveys they conducted, about half a year, but we also have issues with sample size with both pollsters drastically increasing it between their surveys."
"If I am elected, on the first day, we will begin the largest deportation in the history of the United States,"" said the former president."

"And thus, we will start with Kamala Harris's potential states, beginning west in Oregon."
"However, Harris faces challenges in rural and traditional industrial areas, where her green energy policies may raise concerns about job losses."
"Now, Trump campaign officials tell us that's no coincidence, but they built this office as a campaign office for all."

"I just know he's dropping a new book, Bulletproof."
"Sources say other stops include Western Wisconsin, Detroit, Michigan, Raleigh, North Carolina, Savannah, Georgia, Phoenix, Arizona, and Las Vegas, Nevada."

We also know from that day that there were no elections certified inaccurately.
And then he comes over with the hundred dollar bill there.
I know originally it was Joe Biden who was the Democrats pick But then they swapped out Kamala Harris after a bad debate performance by Biden.
Now let's go back to the present and look at the latest polls.
"Take a look at Chester County, Donald Trump, 49.2%, Nikki Haley, 45.2%."
Is there any policies or anything that she would change?
Now Bowers was really on the other end of the spectrum in that fight.
So what are you expecting from the debate with Joe Biden?
Trump didn't even endorse this guy either.
"But I thought the vice president did a great job, both laying out her vision and also prosecuting the case against Donald Trump, showing the clear contrast, particularly on the issue of abortion and the fundamental freedom for women to be able to make decisions over their own bodies."
So he's not winning based off getting 50s.
And the reason I do is there's a lot of love in there.
We went to the rental place.
Our nation belongs to you.
And we will never let any socialist or communist movement take that away from us.
"Oh, for sure."

"Vice President Kamala Harris is making multiple stomps in Michigan on Friday, a crucial battleground state in this race."
"This flip reflected Biden's appeal among working-class voters in the Detroit metropolitan area, as well as a significant push by Democratic organizers to boost turnout in key urban areas."
Shapiro can get all the votes in Pennsylvania and we can go ahead and win it.
"And clean water powers American jobs, powers American industry, and again, powers our entire economy."
"Then Donald Trump just rambles on about telling rich people that made some he doesn't like, that they want him to take over telephone companies."
"So to every person who has come into the country illegally under Kamala Harris's leadership, Kamala Harris wants to roll out the red carpet, give free health care and housing benefits."
So it's just it's totally splintered in the way that even Vance and Mandel in Ohio didn't because Barnett was so strong on Oz on abortion in that debate just came out swinging.
And so that is an extraordinary thing.
"Kamala Harris received 45% of the vote and Donald Trump, 48%."
It's a wonderful state.
You win the election.
"Vance, as weird."
But Pennsylvania is absolutely the most important swing state in this election.
Just look at November of 2020.
Where abortion has become a key issue following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade.
They should have been able to get it done.
It's a valid concern for sure.
The battle for these voters is far from over.
"Now, I know very personally, actually, because I grew up in a family, again, that didn't always have a whole lot of money."
Look at this enthusiasm among Democrats is now at 85 percent.
"And then I'm also here to make a little bit of a speech, and I hope you're gonna come out and listen, and be who you've been having a very good time."
"Stahl makes the case and I believe he's right that were it not for Trump's endorsement of Oz, McCormick would have won the primary."
"Most important thing, it's the fabric and lifeblood of our country and they're destroying our country."
"When Trump was asked the question, he very succinctly said, drill baby drill."
"What I find interesting, though, is that at the same time that one hundred fifty seven thousand voters are still voting for Haley."
It would be murder in the entire country across every state.
"If Kamala Harris is at 49% in the popular vote and Trump is at 48, she's probably going to be cooked in the electoral college, all things considered."
It was fraud.
"Which means, you know, I don't think she had the same like political rudder that Biden has now, you know, we were happy."
And the batteries aren't good.
"Every statewide office is going to be up for election, a governor, secretary of state, all those other offices."
"Come on, Karen."
She's out there saying.
It's way down.
The month of August historically has been the best numbers for Democrats.
"Our votes are our voice, and that's how we can win."
And the crazy thing about it is the person responsible is not even black.
President Obama headlined a rally in Pittsburgh tonight.
"We've seen interesting, some interesting polls here where we had about three out of four polls that showed the race to be a tie."
We've become precisely the opposite.
But here's the good news.
And they explained the cursive writing by adding messages in cursive to eliminate digital reads.
Look at all that.
Things that they have not shown that they want to do.
"The idea that if you are someone who makes a low minimum wage of like $2 in change an hour, but live otherwise on the tips you get from people, which can number far more than that per hour, you shouldn't have to pay taxes on that cash tip."
"Which again, Biden did several points better in Allegheny, even Erie County in a place like Butler, Westmoreland, etc."
And that's it.
So Harris weighted down by this.
We can save them with certain formulas.
There is a visible Secret Service detail.
"Gwen, I mean, girl, you just killed it."
"It's going to be the state that if Trump wins it, he's probably going to win the presidency."
"But keep in mind the polls in 2022 in Pennsylvania, they were pretty much on point before early voting started."
"And if that's the case, well, in a state like Pennsylvania, that's a big freaking deal."
"Pennsylvania is always a swing state, but it feels like the whole election could hinge on it this time around."
"Industries like coal mining, steel production and agriculture remain important in the local economy and policies protecting local jobs from the impacts of globalization are core factors in attracting the support of this group."
"Yeah, yeah, increasingly."
"Speculation continues about Kennedy's potential role in a second Trump administration, though he has avoided discussing specific positions."
"He picked, who was it?"
"They've had a couple of good weeks, but how do they continue to maintain this energy, particularly in a state like Pennsylvania, where your governor, Josh Shapiro, was passed over as the running mate."
It is nonetheless good news for Harris that she is a lead in this state.
Important point.
"We're going to bring it back bigger, better and stronger than ever before."
Not one thing she think of it.
"We will again have a free and fair, safe and secure election."
"We would get a law, and we wouldn't have a president that would try and divide us based upon where we came from."
What do you think about this?
"When Kamala was Vice President, she got a 28% approval rate, which is lower than, I think it was Mike Pence, lower than Dick Cheney, and lower than Biden."
Even Pittsburgh.
It looks like has kind of gotten to the point where it's basically a tie here in Pennsylvania.
We were told that we needed to serve the full shift.
"The polling has been difficult, though, I think, you know, since 2016."
What what?
Send an email.
"And when he does, the reaction he gets from minorities or just young people in general is just it's outstanding."
So you've run this stand for nine years and you haven't voted?
Kamala Harris received 47% of the vote and Donald Trump 48%.
I'm here for the 21 months.
She genuinely cares about the people of the United States and continually fights for equality across the board.
Beautiful package.
Fresh breath.
And what sounds like he's saying he's going to vote for Trump.
I spoke with some young voters today at UNC Greensboro.
I broke out in 2017.
"You don't believe that that leak last week because it almost looked like someone knew is going to, you know, someone said she's going to be meeting."
"I said, have lunch at beautiful Mar-a-Lago."
The illustration reflects the confidence within Kamala Harris's party as they navigate the political landscape.
Just let's start with former president Trump.
I think she does.
But now the surveys seem to indicate that Kamala Harris is now pulling ahead of Donald Trump.
Because do people just forget 2020?
" something really, really, really, really, really weird happened yesterday."
She can refuse to certify.
Are you really going to ignore President Trump?
"There might have been a couple, like one or two, but yeah, there was two polls out of Pennsylvania or actually just one in the final month of the election that had Trump winning Pennsylvania."
"I'm going to bring him in tonight, but the scene has been described as chaotic."
He says Democrats rigged the election in 2020 and he's not going to let them get away with it this year.
Shapiro's statement was credited with causing Trump to lose ground among these supporters in response to Shapiro's comments regarding Trump's falling popularity among populists.
Whereas the Trump campaign is really focused on increasing turnout in rural communities around the state.
 Welcome to Pennsylvania in Focus.
You've got some of the Steelers players now.
Doesn't it seem that Trump has struck a nerve in Pennsylvania?
They want to control what women can and can't do to their bodies.
Knowing that I ask of this guidance only to show myself a coward in defending the course he led me to take.
He drove to the private watch party that we had.
She has this.
"Not exactly a West Hollywood, not exactly the West Hollywood of Wyoming, right?"
Not only do these voters dismiss Trump's many legal challenges.
"I don't, of course, tell me to be argumentative with you."
We can definitely hear it in here.
He's from Scranton.
"Well, I remember he was saying that, you know, Barack Obama wasn't born in this country."
So many interesting aspects of this polling.
I heard today that it was an espionage case.
Each ballot has to be looked at signature verified then run through the machine as I talked about.
She's skipping the Al Smith dinner and basically said that the Knights of Columbus was a hate group.
I did look at his victory margin or lost margin in 2020.
"Now, when we look at Pennsylvania as a whole, we talk about two different regions, but these two regions aren't necessarily that important."
So I will see you all later.
"Hey, Natasha, good evening."
"But to make any difference on ballots, like they were saying, like, you want to go, you know, and vote for the better the better Republican candidate."
Look at that Trump.
"Tim Walz is adding, and he was sort of the do no harm candidate, as many people described."
So we have a major election update.
It's more of the same.
"But I also was, in fact, raised by my grandmother because my mom struggled with opioid addiction for a big chunk of my early life."
"Do you know that, right?"
"Why would you lie about your position on abortion, his position on on the work he did when he was running a company in Pittsburgh years ago and he was outsourcing jobs and and claiming he was creating jobs."
"However, crucially, his margin in 2020 was slimmer than it was in 2016 when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 19 points."
"Yeah, I think things feel really good on the ground in Michigan."
President Trump is on his way to Michigan shortly.
Let me know how you also doing in the comments.
"And I hate to say it, but so many of your colleagues in the media are obsessed with talking about what happened four years ago or some fake scandal."
"I want to thank everybody very much, uh, it's an honor to be with you."
I mean we haven't gone anywhere.
"And now I've been predicting whether it was Joe Biden or where now that it is the vice president Harris, I knew that was gonna be close."
These are incredible people.
"They don't think that she is well known as well known, at least as former President Trump in most voters eyes."
I really don't know what the Harris campaign does if they lose Pennsylvania.
"Tucson, let's go do it."
This requirement is designed to ensure that ballots are processed in a manner that reduces the risk of fraud and upholds the overall credibility of the electoral process.
"But if she adds in, say, Arizona along with Georgia, that's a possibility."
I'm really most of my time a whole food eater.
"All of us members are cheering for Kamala in our own organizations and capacities the same way, she said."
"According to New York Times report, the campaign now has a legal team of hundreds of staff attorneys and thousands of volunteer attorneys to combat expected challenges from Republicans this election cycle, including possibly the results of the 2024 election."
And this was something that was not at least she wanted to ban fracking and then pivoted.
"So I have to tell you as someone who wore this nation's uniform proudly, as someone who now is the commander and chief of the Minnesota National Guard, the idea of sending U.S. military personnel against American citizens makes me sick to my stomach."
"And then Luzerne County, I think it was 2012 and 2008."
This is effectively Joe Biden's home state.
"In fact last year I met a nine-year-old boy his name is Aiden, a young leader."
You forget how jokes go when they're in a room full of human beings with souls.
"And it belongs to you, Christina."
"Then the other part, Schmidt's side slating, is the danger."
"Clean water is essential for our health, clean water is essential for our well-being, clean water is essential for our economy and clean water powers American jobs, powers American industry and again powers our entire economy."
"They've cleaned out the voter rolls, et cetera."
You name anything that's been pretty much like conspiracy theory that came true now as a conspiracy truth.
"In fact, he played a critical role in securing the funds to remove every lead pipe in Pennsylvania."
Their main focus is only in Pennsylvania and they actually have had themselves to be quite accurate in recent elections.
"You're talking about 2.2 million people where 100 percent are displaced, whether you're looking to the health ministry numbers or the Lancet Journal publication, the deaths are somewhere between 40,000 and 180,000, the majority of which are women and children, and 90 percent of civilian infrastructure has been decimated."
They prohibited her for laughing.
The fact that Doug Logan didn't know that shows you just how ill-prepared they are to do this audit.
"It seems like Biden's enthusiasm in eastern Pennsylvania is not going to be where it was in 2020 when you had fresh novelty, and his popularity has tinned since then, and he's struggling in some polls."
"I mean, clearly he and Mitch McConnell have said that they haven't drawn any red lines, really, with any of these election deniers."
"I personally I was happily surprised with Biden because it also was a reflective, I think, of where the Democratic Party has moved."
There's some negative comments that I try to control my best.
"Now, while the Democrats do have their work cut out for them, I think they are in the position of advantage."
"No, I don't have savings."
"And today, EPA is investing $5.8 billion in drinking water and clean water infrastructure upgrades all across the country, thanks to the Biden-Harris administration's investment in America."
"The recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling, which mandates that mail-in ballots be signed and dated, aligns with Trump's position on maintaining strict voting standards."
They're pandering.
"But before he could appear in Tucson a second time, his campaign had to make a deposit of $145,000 up front."
I'm Scranton Joe and the guy who had his advertisements being aired for decades upon decades in the Philadelphia media market where Delaware was.
They have Trump at 50 and Harris at 48.
He says this was a chance for Shapiro to extend his name recognition beyond the Northeast.
"We got the, the positive."
I doubt it.
Do we have a sense of the strategy here?
"Republican strategist Matt Clink, thank you so much for joining us tonight."
She has tied.
What you even know about these routers and why you will not turn them over.
She is following the Trump campaign for us So Olivia Trump is expected to focus on the economy at his event tonight in Nevada What types of policies is he proposing while on the campaign trail and and what can you tell us about them?
Stick around.
"And I wouldn't get caught off guard, right?"
That is an issue.
Juicy.
"But to address the shortage of Border Patrol agents caused by the catastrophic failures of Kamala, our great borders are, who's the worst in history."
Unemployment remains low.
"Yeah, I get all that."
I'm Donald McShane.
"Meanwhile, Trump's rallies in the state have continued to draw large crowds, maintaining his base's enthusiasm."
Is that good enough?
"Cost of living, just making ends meet."
Like he could just really drive out the support in these red counties in Pennsylvania.
"If I was charged in the way Jenna Ellis was, I'd probably be the very first one to roll in on a proper agreement and cut a deal because professionals, lawyers like Jenna Ellis have more to lose than say a hardened criminal who's looking at his third conviction."
"You know, how would you like it?"
We are the Americans who will make America great again.
"Oh yeah, this thing, this was funny, uh, with Alexa."
"I said, up to that time, the circus, I called it the circus, had been brewing with lots of demonstrations, both at the Counting Center, at the Capitol and other places."
"The biggest deal is the rule of law and spreading the big lie, saying that our elections are rigged."
"But I think it's much more plausible that this happens than, oh, yeah, Trump is able to run the table everywhere else."
"Well, listen, these entry level jobs, these are people that get technical degrees as mechanics or welders."
Ashley Ringelberg and her husband Sean Foy feel the weight of their votes in this battleground.
We're talking about a city that's a major source of Democratic votes.
So we can see it's saying Democrats more.
All this has accelerated the conversation about rate cuts in the US.
"Well, you better than four years ago, 43%."
"Soon, soon, soon, soon."
"That is, so the Philly suburbs go like this."
We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.
"I just, I can't believe how much he has bungled his own campaign."
That was a great endorsement.
It was a joke.
And I want to play that along with what we heard from the former president earlier today.
 All you hear is that the Democrats are the ones with the amazing ground game and the Republicans less so.
This is coming from someone that covers the Harris campaign for NBC News.
Harris coming in plus six over Trump and plus five guys.
"Can I presume that that means the 200-odd, less than 200-odd cases that they looked at were not deliberate attempts at fraud and they were just sort of errors?"
"The Harris campaign has a very definite attitude that former president Trump, by denying the 2020 election and rhetoric on the campaign trail so far, makes him unfit."
"However, the population, the overall population of the registered voters has gone up 11%."
"Honey, did you do the dishes?"
"A total of $104 million has been bet on the Democratic vice presidential contract, making it polymarket's third largest by volume."
This is Kamala Harris speaking to a local reporter in Pennsylvania.
"Look, I don't know what the hell Donald Trump's doing with his money."
"And they offered her an opportunity to sign an affidavit basically saying, hey, I didn't cast this ballot by mail, give me another ballot so that I can cast the ballot."
"And in the key battleground states, it could hardly be closer."
As we brace for the final stretch of the campaign.
What are you seeing there?
"So if you do the math on all the polls, Trump is in a very good position."
And that is more problematic.
"According to the last census, about 93,000 residents, so not even close to the population numbers of the city of Philadelphia."
Mexico didn't pay for a wall.
"And the dollars show, the dollars are the only place where there is not as much of a disparity between the Democrats and the Republicans."
"She's switching to Trump in 2024, frustrated by the rising cost of living and running a business in Reading."

I'm not really sure what was behind them refusing to identify themselves when they're even wearing jackets with their names on it.
"They most of them, the majority of them, Hannah, have said there are things they like about Shapiro."
But you just go to see so many of these points.
I don't know all the specifics about it.
"But the margin may be smaller, if that makes sense."
You can't lose Pennsylvania when the election.
"In the Northeast, we have two potential states from 2020 that will be lean."
"Biden retook them in 2020 and if Harris can do the same, then she will be on course to win the election."
"Mabintie, you've written a couple of pieces looking at one of the key battleground states that's going to decide this year's presidential election, and that's Pennsylvania."
That's called wealth creation.
And Sarah Murray is joining us now to talk about this.
"The emphasis on election integrity and security is likely to remain a central theme in the campaign, and the recent ruling in Pennsylvania serves as a reminder of the high stakes involved in this election."
Are they even worth paying attention to or are they just going to make us more anxious?
"Well, first and foremost, African-Americans in America have historically voted Democrat."
"Speaking in the swing state, Obama called on men and black men to vote for Kamala Harris."
"Wilkes-Barre, she's going."
Now this is of no surprise because I've been following Kamala and her national political aspirations for a while.
"That idea unifies this swing county hard work, but the divide is everywhere, like at the popular Fagley's brew pub."
It's one of those counties just north of Philadelphia.
It's a Soviet show trial.
Tanya Melendez thinks putting Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro on the Democratic ticket this year would make a difference.
"But I, I think, you know, up, up and down the lineup in the bullpen, uh, we've got a better team and, and I'm feeling really good."
"So no, we're not going back to that."
"Thank you, man."
Just vote for her because she's black.
"They're hanging it on their barns, and they're really giving a permission slip to their friends and their neighbors."
"You can go to my website, davemccormackpa.com."
We know exactly what he represents and what he would bring in the second term.
My dad worked as a stuntman most of his life.
"I said, look at that."
But here's the thing about this.
Even if you had a family member who acted like that you might still love them but you tell them you've got a problem and you wouldn't put them in charge of anything and yet when Donald Trump lies or cheats or shows utter disregard for our Constitution when he calls POWs losers or fellow citizens vermin.
"We participated in just talking to a lot of wonderful patriots there, praying for our President."
"Thanks for having me, Nivi."
He is safe.
"I mean, there was like literally half a dozen, maybe a dozen of these guys."
Marcus Conte reporting.
"Aaron, thank you so much for that."
"Jim Greenwood, thank you very much for being with me."
"For this Suffolk poll here, they're literally rated number one."
This is an illustration of why Donald Trump is going to win the state of Pennsylvania.
We're going to keep talking about this.
"Now, where are we today and how is 2024 different?"
It's doable.
And so I'm here today to announce some of the work that we have all been doing together over many years that is righting this wrong because I think we all believe that every person in America has a right to clean water and yet today across our nation for far too many Americans that right is under threat for a variety of reasons.
It was just so soon.
"The rally with Elon, I don't know what the final numbers were, but I mean, it was huge."

How's school going?
"To lower housing costs, Kamala is going to cut red tape and work with state and local governments, as well as the private sector, to build 3 million new homes."
What do you think of that?
And let's take a little look at them.
"Obviously, not a good approval rating for president, part of why Democrats no longer have Joe Biden as their nominee."
He very well can crack 20% of the vote in Philadelphia.
"Additionally, they have exceptionally low sample sizes for both surveys and a very high margin of error at 6."
More Trump stuff.
"Trump revisited the town where he survived his first assassination attempt, which was on the 13th of July."
We want to deregulate so that prices on things like gas and oil will go down.
And we hear these takes that are just insane.
"Thank you, Meghan."
"Philadelphia city council member, Kendra Brooks, a member of the working, it's because they're Democrats, we're using their terms."
There's no reason to delay.
I thought she did great.
"But again, the numbers are clear, whether it's three or four points, they would be larger than Joe Biden's victories here back in 2020 and larger than Trump's victory here in 2016."
And so what do we see about the characteristics of those voters when we look at the polls?
Nice to meet you.
There's a reason he underperformed Donald Trump when the national environment was eight points to the right of what it was in 2020.
One is that the third party vote share was very much pushed down.
"Alex, you know, you're doing such an excellent job of breaking down these two states for us."
"But anyways, guys, thanks for watching this video."
"So like a 5149 poll, for example, would be better than this, even though the margin is smaller, even though the margin is smaller, right?"
I will see you next time.
"And we are almost out of time, Mike."
"It's about who we are, how we treat each other."
He's horrible.
"More men gravitating to him, but more women, by and large, gravitating towards her."
It's like 85 percent Catholic.
Meanwhile Trump has a different problem.
And he's running well ahead of Kerry Lake.
I think she was very well-spoken She was very clear on what her policies were and elaborated on them with the time given and the fact that she's Wants to bring back rights for women and Brian you're you're in real estate You're a nice guy too like everyone in this panel and you gave the only C. How come you gave a seat?
They are not people being paid to be here.
"With just 53 days until the election, both campaigns are hoping to build momentum as questions swirl over whether there will be another debate."
So the best message that I can give is to get out there and vote through whatever method makes the most sense.
"If he was shot, he'd be dead."
So we got to get our base out.
"Specifically, when asked about her 9-11 conspiracy theories, he instead said that she is a supporter of his, who is a free spirit and a strong person."
"But they're bringing in like, oh, we're going to have a battery assembly plant, all the parts from China, of course."
Let's go to the image.
you
"New York Times, Biden plus six."
"Biden's administration said from the lectern, the White House press secretary, that he would not, not use executive privilege to shield Donald Trump with the release of information or evidence relating to the January 6th insurrection."
"It may not be a state Trump takes by any more than a point, but still it just matters that he wins it."
Part of the message has to do with immigration.
"And Republicans avoided disaster in Ohio's sixth district, but it was closer than it should have been."
"Trump, according to these polls, has somewhat of a lead in North Carolina and Georgia, places that he really wants to win."
No Republican ever won Erie.
And I think there's just such a mix of so many different opinions.
"An unfavorable rating for Bob Casey is 38%, so that's that, I mean, in the 33% favorable rating for Bob Casey."
Watkins says each candidate has their strengths.
"He poured $75 million over the last three and a half months of his own money into a political action committee that is not only just doing the ground game on behalf of the former president in states like Wisconsin, so actually boots on the ground and paying for people and bodies to knock on doors and turn out the vote, encouraging people to refer friends for $47 to be involved in the election and to say, hey, maybe this person's a Trump voter, but they might not vote."
"As Kelly Clarkson said, and all you'd ever hear me say is how I picture me with you."
"As far as my opinion, I believe the man has enough common sense to realize that this is a source of income."
The Democrats have committed over 250 million dollars to in the stretch after Labor Day weekend.
"I mean, we've seen it when he was talking about the former senator."
Missouri has one as well.
 Could you imagine renting an electric vehicle and driving from New York City to California?
That's a four-point swing.
"The Harris campaign and its allies have locked in $77 million in ads for Pennsylvania, showcasing just how important the state is to both sides."
And North Carolina is likewise headed toward red.
"So if we're coming in high at tie, that means Trump's win."
And when do officials expect to be able to announce the results there?
"You know, now that fracking has worked as well as it has, there was a point in time, at least when Trump was president, that we were energy independent."
She quit after two weeks.
" Turning now to the US campaign trail, Vice President Kamala Harris takes an indirect jab at her Republican rival Donald Trump."
That's what you have to deal with when you're looking at this endorsement.
"Hillary Clinton won it by just 2,700 votes in 2016."
A couple of different things here.
I just can't fathom the average Jane and Joe Pennsylvanians ever buying the BS that comes from the Harris campaign.
That's why it's a big deal.
"In Georgia meantime, our tale is somewhat similar."
You may be feeling like you're having flashbacks there.
And if they are okay with that perception.
I will not play with laws I swore allegiance to.
"We remember you being president, buddy, for four years."
 And so we have this Quinnipiac poll and this was a swing state poll.
They flipped parties.
I think he's a good guy.
And I think that's one of the things that the campaign is deeply understood is that the messaging is fundamentally about the same thing.
"How significant is this win for Masters and really, I guess, for the weight of Trump's endorsement in this state?"
"I could tell you if I weren't doing this where I would have been, I would have been in a very nice location."
"You need to think about those 39 minutes when he pranced around the stage playing disc jockey and dancing at his own rally just a couple of days ago, the word salads that have gotten worse and more incoherent."
"We're already down in Michigan, but we could run the table with everything else."
That's a terrifying moment despite the fact that Trump turns into Professor Freak at the end of that sentence.
"During my four years, nothing happened and there was great pressure on me having to do with guns."
I Hope so.
Does it impact your calculation for what you do?
This is Donald Trump who will say anything and everything depending on where the wind is blowing.
Also this custom cowboy hat.
They're specifically targeting Rust Belt states.
Any leader of any organization has to have a certain amount of loyalty from the people that are working on an organization.
"You see this in the banking sector, them trying to say we're not going to allow you to open a bank account if you don't agree with us."
"Oh, sure."
So I'll be voting no for that reason.
He also said that the Republican Party has failed to preserve social freedoms.
"Mind you, this is supposed to be the premier security detail on the planet."
I'm in OHA.
Luzerne County is the name.
We're getting good numbers out of North Carolina.
"And when I asked him, like, I mean, essentially, how is he feeling here?"
And that's why the data suggesting Trump's gonna probably win Pennsylvania is not good news for Harris.
That's liberal stuff.
So you kind of can't compete.
We have no incentive to stop spying because of that shit.
I'm not leaving.
"If he has a slight improvement among white non-college voters, again, he expands his margin significantly."
"Again, Harris leads this poll by one point."
Biden's endorsement of Harris only pushing her further away.
"A few feet away, a group of hard nose on Trump see a threat to rights and democracy."
"But right now they found R plus two and even the insider mayor's, I should say, they found the race tide."
"I saw this video earlier today, but it was so short."
"Donald Trump in a lot of the Western Pennsylvania counties sees saw gains even in 2020, despite losing ground nationwide and losing ground in the state as a whole."
You want to take a look at Erie County.
Those are the type of figures who she has aligned herself with.
So there's all different types of voters in Wilkes-Barre.
"You take somebody who's familiar to the region, you replace them with a liberal nut job from California who's been on record flip-flopping on something like fracking and, you know, co-sponsored the initial Green New Deal."
"Only God knows, right?"

Donald Trump was speaking at an NRA event on Friday night.
What does she think she's like Trump or something.

"Because if you start focusing on any one individual poll, you can sort of get sidetracked in one narrative or another, or sort of choose your own adventure that promotes your own biases."

"You know, maybe you get one or two of those people here and there, but that's not the lion's share of the people registering as Republicans or even independents for the record."

"If the Republican Party can't acknowledge that they lost the 2020 presidential election and move on to do the things that they have to do in order to win in 2024, this will be a boat anchor around their necks for a decade to come."
You can see the difference.

"The front doors of the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library were made of glass, while that security guard was at the back of the library, the other end of the building, looking out at this woman in the parking lot, who was apparently there to create a diversion, while he was on the other side of the building."
This is about the Georgia election interference case What can you tell us about that?
And maybe that would allow this to go through.
"I mean, I've won the state of Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, generally the Dakotas, the Prairie areas, they don't have a chance to hell."
Because shutting down fracking will also harm them.
It's neck and neck in swing states.

"And that's why they're expecting to see lots of travel for her in the coming months as they try to cut into some of the margins, especially when it comes to the economy, they're going to tout her economic plan and what she has proposed to cut down taxes for middle class voters, as well as grocery prices, but it's going to be a task that they need to fill the next two months if they want to win this election."
"When Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee, replacing President Joe Biden on the ticket over the summer, Shapiro's name was immediately floated as a potential running mate."
I believe in this energy stuff all of a sudden now.
"Well, Lana, this has been in the works for a while now, the Trump campaign wanting the former president to return to the scene of the crime, essentially, to show defiance in this campaign."

I'm having a lot of fun here everybody.
"You know, look, looky, looky, looky."
"But our education, our meeting the voter, our courting the voter is producing real tangible results."
This is not what this country needs.
"Look, I know it was four years ago, but but the way it stressed all of our markets domestic internationally, the further we get away from all of that spending, and even some of the supply chain disruptions that you're thinking about more so two years ago, but as we get further away from what was a hundred year economic event, everything is improving."
And here's what I'll say.
"I mean it's scary to think about at this point, but I'm feeling more hopeful than I have in a long time, so it's really exciting."
My name is Anthony Bryan Logan.
You click on get or the cloud icon and enjoy it.
"So Kamala Harris, when she's here in Michigan, she's really hammering home the fact that it was the Biden-Harris administration that passed this massive inflation reduction act, which contains billions of dollars worth of grants and subsidies and credits and incentives for green energy and especially important here in Michigan for green vehicles, incentives to buy them, but more importantly here in Michigan, incentives to build them, incentives to convert factories into electric vehicle factories."
Lovely.
He was the Silence of the Lands.
I'd rather listen to someone that's actually going to do something for this country.
"Because at this level, you expect a well-oiled machine."
She was saying also that she was committed to passing the Green New Deal.
It's definitely true.
They're going around Butler.
"They're supposed to be, I mean, who knows?"
But Pennsylvania could be a critical state and the willingness of a massive number of people to show up has to count for something.
And the only way we're going to do it is if we elect Donald J. Trump.
 We're going to go now to Gotti Schwartz.
"Because here in Erie, they've asked him for a $35,000 payment for the previous rally, which he has ignored."

"So they are they brought out families that were separated during the Trump administration, their border separation policy."
She has a good track record.
"Now, the papers do, and you just write on a sheet of paper, concept of a plan."
One of the big criticisms from former President Trump today of Vice President Harris is that she's been the nominee now for several weeks.
I've spent a lot of time there particularly in 2020 The people there are unsure about it say there's actually a divide between it is either bear or Barry It's named after a guy named Isaac B-a-r-r-e with an accent in a French pronunciation But there there is indecisiveness even on the level of how to pronounce that in that County that is in Lezern County which is particularly fascinating because that is a Obama Obama Trump Trump County It's a place that about five years before Donald Trump really even stepped onto the political stage a guy named Lou Barletta ran from Hazleton the neighboring town to Wilkes-Barre and kind of set the playbook for a populist candidate like Donald Trump years before he did it so this is a place that Harris sees potential VP Harris sees potential to win back an area that traditionally has been a bit red but that Obama president Obama was able to win only about a decade ago So we got some new polling numbers out from Reuters and it shows Harris up five points over Trump nationwide I mean when we're talking about such a close race five points is kind of significant I think over half the respondents also said that they viewed Harris as a winning the debate against Trump So I don't know about this this poll.
But what you haven't seen yet is the national numbers break yet.
Evidence can be hearsay evidence.
"I feel like having a woman in office will make the, like... will make reproduction rights more available for women."
"Can't do that yet, even though they're trying hard to do that."
"I know what this kind of rhetoric can lead to, and it leads nowhere good."
So that's why all of this election integrity is so important.
"Their final 2020 poll was, you know, Trump plus two."
The freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water.
"I think he was a little frustrated, but he ultimately did."

He's a hot mess.
"I think what's interesting is how Biden is going to message this because we've all said for the better part of a decade now, and we've said, you know, this could be the thing that finally turned suburban voters against Trump."
And that genuinely surprised me.
"And these are the things we can be united around democracy, public education, et cetera."
"Yeah, the austerity politics of... And the media and everyone understands this when it's time to forgive, say, the funds given to businesses during the COVID pandemic."
Dick Pullman.net You wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer like I said for 22 years covering the presidential elections in 1992 96 2000 2004 and 2008 How do you view Pennsylvania as a swing state in this year's presidential election?
How much stock should we be putting in these polls in terms of what they actually tell us about the race?
"Now the state of Maine and the state of New Hampshire, along with Minnesota over here, have followed similar trends over the last couple cycles."
"Yeah, he's probably the clear favorite at that point."
It's a tight race.
I haven't seen nothing done.
"But Lake's vote here is much more spread out, including a lot who say they're because there she's the party nominee and fewer who say because they like the candidate in particular, which again helps explain why Lake is running so much behind Donald Trump right now."
Many guys think it's being drained by their aging bad genetics or maybe even a lack of exercise.
Has that stemmed any of the suspicion about the election result?
Hey everybody Thank you guys so much for tuning into another episode Let me know what you thought of the video down in the comments.
I don't like either candidate.
And Jill Stein is still in there.
"I am here to ask you to vote for my friend and your outstanding congressman, Raul Grijalva."
Adams believes that Harris' leadership is essential in navigating the complexities of the digital age and ensuring that citizens' rights are protected.
"So if Trump is up in Pennsylvania, well, go back to the map here."
We're just alienating ourselves against Russia even more and escalating tensions.
"And so they also found that amongst voter demographics, Kamala Harris performed better than Biden did with key Democratic coalitions, doing better amongst black voters in these swing states and younger voters, and also gaining ground with older voters that can explain why Kamala Harris is ahead by four points when Biden only won Wisconsin by one, or Pennsylvania by one, or Michigan by three."
"Sorry, everybody."
"I mean, this isn't just a Republican."
Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely Sir that you will absolutely accept the result of this election.
"And keep in mind, as the election goes on, you are going to see more of the early vote."

So what about Nevada?
"And their plan moving forward is really allow more Americans to get that stock market, make sure when we have this, you know, the Fed is going to cut rates in September."
I don't think it's worn off yet.
"Now, there are some circumstances where, you know, it's better later on the cycle or earlier, but most of the time, August is the best polling for Democrats virtually every single cycle, not just for the presidency, but for House races, for the Senate, for governorships."
They've already made up their minds for Harris.
"Inflation, too, is a key concern, with 78% of voters highlighting it as a major factor in their decision."
"Harris plus four, Harris plus three from two pollsters that are absolute shit and have long histories of overstating Democrat support."
"Faint political writer at the Los Angeles Times, Sima Mehta, told us both candidates are sharpening their attacks in those key states, even though, you know, obviously this is a national election, but ultimately it's going to come down to a handful of battleground states."
"But what we know, based on data points, even before she announced Tim Wallace as the VP, and I do think he adds a lot, especially being from the Midwest, an election winner of 2020 and 2022 rather in 2018, he does well in the state, is that Pennsylvania, right now I have as a lean Democratic state, I do believe Kamala Harris and Tim Wallace can win it."
Can you lay out once and for all what you know about these routers?
"Well, here, Donald Trump says that if President Biden wins the election, that one of the things that's going to happen is that the name of Pennsylvania will be changed."
Like dead people voting in Philadelphia.
"And I know it is long overdue, and it is time that we actually implement solutions, and I'm here to say we are."
The narrative surrounding turnout is far more than just a matter of numbers.
That's the way they're framing it.
"US, former LA Daily News editor Ron Kay has passed away at the age of 83, leaving behind a legacy of fierce journalism and community advocacy."
That number is very important.
"New reports, meanwhile, say that Harris' team is getting nervous over Trump's gains just 18 days out from the election."
"Of course, if Donald Trump wins, then that remains in limbo for a while."
"... ... God's Love We Deliver cooks and brings over 2 million meals a year to men, women, and children living with HIV AIDS, cancer, and other serious illnesses, and they need your help now more than ever."
What can you tell us about the event today that's going to be held in Pennsylvania?
"According to O'Neill's U.S., one out of every five Hispanics will vote in their first presidential election this year."
Harris leads Trump by a staggering 54% to 40% among voters aged 18 to 49.
"In August, Harris received 50 percent of the vote and Trump received 47 percent."
That's why you see her taking the time to come to Bucks County.
Maybe it's wrong.
"If it's a cheap stunt, then you got a picture of Kamala literally flipping burgers."
They're implying their opinion.
"Further alienates independent voters, women, minorities, Haitian immigrants and the like."
"Zach, what can you tell us about the particular stops the campaigns are making today and what it reveals about their strategies?"
Just wanted to put that back out there.
So you look at all the big musicians.
I'm glad everyone's okay.
So a lot of stuff growing in Pennsylvania Her Hispanic numbers generally going up and I actually think Pennsylvania is more likely to go blue than Wisconsin Which is actually better because Pennsylvania is 19 electoral votes Pennsylvania under or Pennsylvania is 19 Wisconsin is just 10 so much much better to win Pennsylvania than Wisconsin
I think the woman would.
Good to have you back.
How's that working out for you?
Probably because I stood up.
That's why it's such a big deal if Pennsylvania goes towards Trump.
"And two weeks later, right here in the great state of Pennsylvania, Pow!"
"Just look, we go live every Wednesday at 7 p.m. Eastern time."
Those voters tend to be younger.
And you see the results there.
"Well, and then back in 2012, former President Barack Obama won this state."
"As Trump and Vance have demonstrated of late, words mean things."
"And that is maybe part of the equation, suburban women who used to be Republican who may be trending left."
And then the trend line continued.
It was by the thinnest of margins.
And they keep track of how many votes come in every single day.
And that's more because Minnesota Democrats actually had unified control of state government for the last after the twenty two midterms when they gained control of the state Senate.
Trump and two others were also injured in the shooting.
"Democrats added only 17,000."

Like we should want our elected officials to be honest with us.
"Well, here's the deal."
"It's not, it's not happening."
"Historically, they don't show up in mass like the older age groups."
So it's a lot to keep an eye on.
Appreciate you.
We can spend a little more time.
And that's against the backdrop of a bunch of races to be the top elections official that we've covered that have now partisan Republican candidates running basically in the mode of the big lie.
It's done.
I'm not going to get triggered by this thing.
The extremes we're not going to change.
"Okay, let me go over to let me go over to Twitter really quick."
This battle is as close as it gets.
I think she's really leaning into these issues that impact people personally and then doubling down on whether it's housing or child tax credit those are those are pretty big differences and I don't think that's that's a pejorative towards it there were other issues that were being dealt with and she's her own leader she's got her own path a new way forward.
I wonder what the hell happens during that 45.
We've already begun audits in four counties.
You don't have to go to college.
"Real quick, 20 seconds."
"I've really only voted once in my life, but I think I might vote this year."
"If you want to read into it too much, Trump's in trouble in Indiana but apparently, you know Biden in Minnesota despite running up against literally nobody getting 71% of the vote."
I mean if you're gonna do it do it right and yes that is patriotism at its best.
"So even if these states are becoming more politically diverse, those changes could really shake things up in the electoral college, right?"
And they both join me now.
" With just over a month to election day, both candidates are busy on the campaign trail."
"And so the campaign recognizes that as Plouffe has said, and, and Kamala Harris is doing well with them."
"I don't wish death on anybody at all, right?"
And she has a lot of love.
This has Reuters claims that anxiety is rising in the VP's campaign over Trump's swing state gains.
"So the first thing we're gonna see here is we're gonna come up here, of course, I mean, I started doing a video, someone wants to go outside, someone being the big baby over there, the big old, it's raining outside, puppy, rain outside, right?"
I wanted to reflect that there are people that have different opinions and I just thought that was a good opportunity.
"You know, however, election, there's a must win state like it used to be Florida, Ohio, even for a little bit there was Virginia."
"But I think what most Americans feel is a deep commitment to this country and a desire to do right by this country, even if we disagree on health care policy, tax policy, whatever you name it."
"Now, I want you to think about that."
"Both Michigan and Wisconsin right now pretty much are states that look like they are going to be in the blue column, but if we look at a lot of the polling, it shows that Pennsylvania might be a little bit more of a toss-up, maybe even go into the Republican side."
I'm Natasha Brown as Izzie Schuler is off tonight.
The black voters for Trump.
"Look, I think they're right."
But I'll be back with some more polling data as soon as it comes out.
"If Harris is doing a point worse than Biden in Pennsylvania, Trump's got it."
It was very loud.
And I think Mark Burnovich now has some real problems on his hands because he's the base of the parties that is turning against him as a result of President Trump's attack upon.
"One woman told me that at the height of her bartending career, she was making about $100,000 a year in tips on top of a base salary."
"Bob Casey's problem is that he is an incumbent at a time when Americans are very dissatisfied with the status quo, especially on the Democratic side."
That's all you'd ever hear me say.
"You have Brandon right over there, who's a leader for a long time, brilliantly the leader."
"He was very ready in the moment And if you think about it, he kind of knows how the CIA operates In fact He could have built a whole team while he was president that Studies and figures out how you could fool the CIA and put them in place and be ready to do it Bottom line."
"Ugh, that's not good for them, because they need to win Pennsylvania."

"So Harris, if she wins it, I really think she's got the presidency."
"I didn't know we had a video here, so let me get my headphones ready and I'll play this clip here."
"Just to barely win the presidency and even if you get to 69, that's not enough."
You have candidates to vote for in this election.
Y'all probably be vacationing together.
"What he's trying to do, specifically in this case, unclear, but we know he's been trying to sow doubts and suggest that he's not getting proper attention or credit for the size and popularity of his campaign."
So this Pennsylvania stuff is really the big stuff.
Democrats talk about challenging in Florida.
"But you need to have those conversations, though."
Thank you so much for that.
"Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, we've got Wisconsin, we've got North Carolina."
"But, but Alex, how does that become some kind of a conspiracy theory?"
But these are the numbers that we're going to be following.
It's so mind-bogglingly crazy.
That has been rejected.
It's hope fuel.
"Now, I understand a tariff is any imported good."
They think it's okay.
One of the things you could do with just the right history degree and just the right set of skills is you could grow up to be a history cop who busts people for pilfering stuff or messing with stuff in the National Archives of the United States.
"McCormick is kind of lagging Trump's vote share, I think because there are just a lot of Pennsylvanians who haven't made up their mind about him."
And we want people to make sure if they enjoy this and I know they do your podcast getting downloaded like crazy as part of the clay and Buck podcast network.
"But still, the threats come in."
Ukraine now has Russian territory.
You're looking at how important Jewish voters were in the 2016 election and in the 2020 election.
But who needs moving average when we have a set of cross tabs that we're about to show you that aggregate the last five nights of data.
You can see here the picture of him.
It's so good to see you.
"Then we heard him on the microphone, Shannon, saying, let me grab my shoes as they tried to take them off."
And these are sponsored by American Thinker.
But that's the world we live in today.
Now let's get to the real meat.
How do you think that's going to play with some Latino Hispanic voters?
And J.D.
He did reflect on the assassination attempt itself.
"Walls, a former congressman, has been an ardent backer of both Biden and Harris."
Harris receiving 48% of support among likely voters with Trump at 47% well within the margin of error.
"You have candidates to vote for in this election who demonstrate character, who know what real strength looks like, who will set a good example and will do the right thing and lead this country better than they found it."
"Pennsylvania has been at the forefront of our political conversations, especially as both the Democratic campaigns and Republican campaigns look to it as a prime opportunity, not only for the presidential level, but also on the congressional level, whether the Senate or the House, and potentially even a state legislative flip in either chamber this coming November."
Harris leads in Pennsylvania 52% to 45 Harris leads in Michigan 51% to 45 Harris leads in Wisconsin 50 to 47.
May God bless you all.
"The numbers are in, and we now know 67 million people tuned in for the presidential debate, between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump."
"So these look really nice for Wisconsin, right?"
"Sinister, indeed."
He's focusing on trade policies that he claims will benefit American workers and revitalize the industrial sector.
We just want to get back to it.
"We're leading in all depending on which one, but almost all of the swing states."
You know it's definitely helped the financial benefits as far as the community continues to do well because they're getting royalties off of the gas wells so that's a good thing.
I think we saw some of that in the sound bite.
"The vice president, Kamala Harris, insist she won't ban fracking today despite claiming otherwise back in 2019."
"She was seen talking, even hugging, a lot of voters there inside those stores."
We got the biggest criminal in the world running around playing golf.
"And yeah, you did have some pollsters that were like flooding the zone, they will say, but you can't compare a midterm year to a presidential year."
I take it you believe the election was stolen.
"If the trajectory of the race though remains roughly stable, I would expect Trump to win Pennsylvania."
And I suspect most of you grew up the same way.
"You know, you could have these intentions and then when you get into the presidency, you don't have the ideological foundations or rudder that can make you address questions that come to your desk and personnel decisions."
Another critical battleground state.
"While voters felt Trump is the better candidate to help with the economy and inflation, a majority felt Harris is more likely to help the middle class."
What did your notes say anyway?
That's racist.
It's a state that hasn't voted for a Democrat for the White House since 1996.
"The convention will likely highlight tensions between Harris and pro-Palestine activists, reflecting her more critical stance on Israel's actions in Gaza."
14.
Nice and loud.
She will drive out the white women in wisconsin She will win And I want y'all to go on twitter after this live and search gretchen whitmer And watch how the republicans are attacking her as we speak because they are deathly afraid of this woman They're so afraid of this woman.
"But he also criticized her Republican opponent this fall, arguing that former President Donald Trump would be more likely to cross a picket line than to join one."
"Lieutenant Governor, let me start with you, because you were on a ticket with Governor Josh Shapiro in 2022 that really ran a 57-county strategy in the Commonwealth."
The message that I have is I endorse you voting come November.
Something's wrong.
"Yeah, look, I think it is a somewhat less salient point but still nevertheless quite salient."
"Just honestly, do your research."
"With the 2024 race in Pennsylvania, it also spread to other states, where Michigan and Wisconsin, who largely do vote with the state of Pennsylvania and hold very similar voter sentiments and voter demographics, also started turning away from President Biden, as well as the larger Democratic Party."
"But I know at least on the Democratic side, we've been making sure that we're messaging in the appropriate way to connect with Latino voters, focusing on issues that are important to Americans because all of these voters are fundamentally and before anything else Americans, but making sure that we're doing it in a way that's culturally sensitive and sometimes in Spanish."
And so they did start a sort of an inquiry into it.
You can have that conversation.
It's a source of bargaining in the world.
Joe Biden open convention.
She's there because she wants to boost her platform of small businesses.
 widening gender gap and for more on the Harris campaign I want to bring in ABC News senior White House correspondent Selena Wang.
"You're only receiving a fraction of what other people, what you were supposed to receive, essentially."
I never did.
He had a pretty good upbringing and had a pretty secure life growing up just like I did.
That was Tim Bultzer's whole messaging.
"Just win Wisconsin, which I believe there's be a big point miss yet again there, and Nevada, which oddly enough is actually like Trump plus two in the RCP average, despite some wonky polls having him down by three or four."
"In summation, Pennsylvania represents a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing Kamala Harris in her presidential ambitions."
"Hmm, that's fascinating."
Is he kind of salty about what's happening about him not getting picked in his walls instead of him?
Let me just give you the bottom line though.
So I think the vibes are good in Michigan.
It's not just the Latinos latinx community that they're struggling with maybe because they keep calling them latinx.
They've weaponized.
"So the way I kind of look at these things with, you know, 40 days or so to go is who would I rather be?"
Just watch.
"And if they don't, you tell them he's got concepts of a plan."
But this is not about moving a constituency that is feeling deep pain.
There was a conservative group who got together and put together the project 2025 agenda and they're doing that to get people outraged.
They released this past week and Saturday and Sunday which because we've seen a lot of this kind of really screwy down you know down deep in the weeds when you're looking at the cross tabs of polling some polling showing Donald Trump getting a huge number of black voters or Hispanic voters and then oddly very small numbers amongst white voters and that's what's kind of causing these top line numbers a little bit odd.
I don't have to worry about that.
"So this is, this is what it sounds like."
I came in and immediately.
"From NBC News, local Republicans reject Trump's claims about Haitian immigrants in their towns."
"He's in Pennsylvania campaigning for us, not me, for us."
One of the biggest movements that happened in the last couple of years was obviously the BLM and the association with police and law enforcement.
"Like people that are, like we can't all be experts on everything, you know?"
"It shows Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by two points, with Harris polling at 49% and Trump at 47%."
"But the fact is, Mr. Mayor, Jill Stein is not going to be president of the United States."
"They're fighting still, Laura, over whether or not the microphones will be turned off when it is no longer the candidate's time to speak."
"There's 150,000, 146,000 independent votes for Johnson."
Three cheers for Donald Trump.
You're totally fucked.
"And a lot of people thought, well, that's crazy."
"And we've, we've been clear and said again today that U.S. energy companies must bring, must keep bringing pump prices down by closing this historic, historically large gap between wholesale and retail gas prices."
"If you lose your job farming, don't worry."
"And even when they do try quoting any other MLK line, they apparently can't be bothered to read any further than the exact quote they're looking for."
Only 32 percent of CNN watchers say protecting our democracy.
See if you can drop it down.
"And Donald Trump, if you look at the Venn diagram, is both a rapist and a fraudster."
"Some of you know that when I was growing up, I was a child, and I was a child."
"At the start of the request cycle, it was 64% Democrat and only 25% Republican."
It made a lot of people uncomfortable.
"I think it's going to happen because we're just getting out too close for either side to back out, and everybody assumes it's going to happen."
I'm a big Joe Biden fan.
Trump needs over 60% of the white vote to win.
"Who do you think will win Pennsylvania, Trump or Harris?"
"Okay, high five."
"Despite Trump's edge on economic issues, Harris is seen as having strong moral character and mental sharpness, which could sway undecided voters."
"They can cause people, compel people, persuade people to do things, to act."
"With less than 100 days to the election, Reading's residents are paying attention and feel the weight of the decision ahead."
They don't want to be part of it.
He's like he's even got those Keith Olbermann glasses man.
And when Harris herself was on The View earlier this month when she was asked that very question she said she couldn't think of anything that she would have done differently compared to President Biden but then 30 minutes later into that interview she said she would appoint a Republican in her cabinet but Harris more recently now she's tried to draw a little more distance with President Biden saying that she will be a different president because of who she is her background in her policy focus but still struggling to get really specific and clearly articulate how she'd be different from the president and I can tell you I can I've been talking to some Democrats who say her real vulnerability is on the economy and articulating a clear vision there when so many Americans are frustrated with inflation even though it has been slowing down Kana.
And I think Governor Walz has proven time and time again he's capable of doing that.
"So if it's case by case and she says on this case, they weren't going to honor it and now they're kind of pulling back from that, it feels like they may still leave room to not fork over stuff around this case."
You heard his words coming from him.
It's gone.
Decide the poll of the revisionist history of his years.
"In fact, she played a video of one of his latest comments where he talked about having the military go after the enemy within."
"We just got to see what happens, but the Harris campaign, they're a lot more trouble than some people think if they're down in Pennsylvania by two to three points because how are you supposed to come back from that, especially if Trump's already at 49% that means with undecideds allocated, Trump's probably above 50% of vote."
It's insurrection.
We're talking about the abortion issue in St. Louis.
Yeah that's absolutely true.
"Like, hey, Trump, go back to your greatest hits."
"Look, even on the most contentious issues, I've always said there are good people of conscience on both sides of the abortion divide."
Federman now says he doesn't want to debate Dr. Oz.
"So this is in line with what you would expect, and when you look at it, Donald Trump, among those definitely voting close to 50%, this is a brutal poll for Joe Biden out of Pennsylvania."
"I'm the only governor in the entire country with a divided legislature, one house led by Democrats, one led by Republicans."
"Church-going, yeah, but I bet it's voodoo church!"
I think we got an opportunity to really pick up that seat in the south central part of our state.
"The ruling strengthens his campaign's messaging on election integrity, mobilizes supporters, provides a tactical advantage in a key battleground state, and sets a precedent for other states."
"In fact, our state motto is under God, the people rule."
And we're talking about a stock market that hasn't seen this type of sell-off in quite a while.
He's doing an extraordinary job on behalf of our administration.
She's been loyal so far but she's going to cut her own path.
"Yes, both lifelong Republicans."
"The question is those voters who have decided elections in Arizona and frankly elected Democrats in several of them, is that message, which should be a message to me was just kind of a hodgepodge of Democratic liberal positions going to win the race."
These are not good things for her.
But then came Quinnipiac University.
"So we'll check out 538, latest polls for President of the United States in the great state of Pennsylvania and very, very close race."
"I mean, they threw him off the back of the train."
"However, the Trump campaign was the exactly that's okay."
"At Harris's rally this weekend, she said her administration would get rid of attacks on tips for service workers."
How come I was looking for policy information I really wanted to see some substantive policy information.
"And so what the Biden administration last week said was, well, with respect to January 6th, we're going to let these White House officials be subpoenaed, testify in front of Congress and the like."
And I'll tell you what you know.
But Walls ended up getting picked.
And in this election.
I liked her plan in for the middle class.
"Though most black men agreed to President Obama's sentiments, some made some rather strong objections."
"So Nevada, I mean, these are really, really good early vote numbers, but this is a very, very early, early snapshot."
And it's all nasty negative ads that they're using to attack him.
"Now, just take a look, for example, in a rural district, Pennsylvania's House District, 139."
Is the Trump campaign considering legal action in Arizona?
"President Joe Biden is no stranger to Pittsburgh's Labor Day activities, but Tom Reiss with our partner WESA in Pittsburgh reports this year he was campaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris."
"So when the Democrat candidate starts professing support for Trump, what does that say?"
"For example, at Trump's rally over the weekend, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell claimed he had invented a new form of paper for future elections that was somehow even more secure than the paper we have now."
Putting an end to fracking once and for all.
"You just heard from former American Express CEO, former President Bill Clinton, and of course Vice Presidential Nominee Tim Walts laying out the Democratic Party's economic messaging this week at the DNC in Chicago."
"Oh, the hot chocolate."
They have no evidence of that at all.
"Well, I wouldn't say that if you're just talking about, I mean, maybe Pennsylvania, there might be a 0% chance."
"I don't know why Mike Lee just sounds like really like Republican for a reason, but he's not."
"And if we're going to have early voting and mail in voting and election day voting, then we need to take advantage of every opportunity we have to vote."
"In fact, they refute what Donald Trump has said."
"But Biden had an 8.9 percent lead in 2020 and Clinton, who went on to lose, I would remind our viewers, had a 7.1 percent lead."
So Fox News used birtherism.
I think there is a danger that they tune the president out.
Rachel Scott taking us on a tour of Pennsylvania.
This is massive.
Trump also appeared to question Harris's race.
"I just want to find 11,780 votes."
That's right.
It is what it is.
Pennsylvania will be the only state that you see Joe Biden campaign in because it's the only swing state where he actually has some deep roots.
The margin of error is 2.7 percent.
So Pennsylvania that is the choice in this election.
"And so normally that's not a big deal, but because this election was always going to be close, it actually has outsized impact."
"Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs this year, she's also now running for governor."
Has anyone thought about unplugging America and plugging it back in again?
She'll do well in certain suburbs of Philadelphia.
And how big of an issue is this for voters in Pennsylvania?
That were competitive.
Can you give us a sense of what other policies you want to unveil?
There are reports that the Haitian migrants were eating geese and ducks.
You have the same we're not working well together.
"Here and there, there's a few undecided, but at least for the presidency, people generally are locked in."
He wants to help Puerto Rico grow and succeed as a country So let's stand out tall and united and we all won't remember that he all he wants to keep helping Latinos in the US Let's do things the right way and let's keep growing.
We're going to raise a little bit of money for you and in return you're going to tow the line.
So we did see that at one point the protesters besides chanting to get the ballots counted and get the results out.
"And you keep going, Quinnipiac, we all know they are a trash pollster."
"Same pollster, same group of people, same methodology, Trump plus five turned into Harris plus two."
I wanted to get what's your reaction to many Democrats?
"Fracking is indeed and at the heart of the discussion, Camilla, Camilla Harris has flip flop on this issue like a gaffed tuna."
"This is Tying It Together with Tim Boyam, a Spectrum News Production."
"Of course, turnout's important."
It's closed.
"I'm the only one has to beat two people, not one."
So Bob Casey will be there in Wilkes-Barre.
"So who do I trust insider advantage, which has a a decent track record, not perfect, but it's all right or Suffolk, which is a garbage pollster that doesn't know how to pull out of Pennsylvania and they they dropped a Harris plus three here, which is actually an improvement for Trump compared to 2020 and 2016 or I trust insider advantage."
And for what?
"And in a time, as my colleague Secretary Hobb said, that this is dangerous for democracy."
Random people at his rallies screaming that they agree with him.
And that's why they typically don't understand the electorate and they may accidentally get it right in like the midterms because those people are going to be overrepresented it vastly.
"Well, I think the reason Trump is here is show strength, that he will not be chased away."
"Just months ago, the republics were asking for this exact bill to deal with the border to provide support for Ukraine and Israel."
The Harris campaign knows it.
"You tell me at the end of the day, you know what I'm saying?"
So there's that.
"It says Harris courts Polish American votes in Pennsylvania Polish Americans are an important if politically overlooked demographic, but in Pennsylvania many have tended to lean Republican So keep in mind Pennsylvania is a dog fight."
So they both are the same and I am certainly not voting for any of them at all.
All of these locations are in Pennsylvania.
It's a very active political county.
The first presidential debate is set for a week from today.
"Oh, who's to say?"
"On Saturday, Trump will hold a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, returning to the site of that first assassination attempt back in July."
"Five point five average error, five point five partisan bias in favor of the Republicans."
We also have to make sure that the system works the way it was supposed to.
"Debate and public engagement, Harris prepared for the first presidential debate in Pittsburgh and has since engaged in various interviews and rallies across the state."
We'll start with you.
I could be in a gorgeous beach somewhere in the world.
So let's dig into this Associated Press investigation.
I'm a data geek.
Well kind of.
"But when you see these gangs of hundreds of young, usually young people go and attack an apartment store, a department store in San Francisco."
You are kind of like a lap dog for the Republican nominee.
Click on the notification bell because your boy is here for a good time in a long time.
"He was up 4% on this day, September 19th in 2020, and Hillary Clinton was up 6.6 points in 2016."
"Keep in mind, these races are going to be so close, Laura, so very, very close in eight or 10 states, maybe even now."
"For Rodney Nace, it's about Trump's track record."
"Trump is doubling down on his appeal to the state's industrial workers and rural communities, emphasizing his commitments to job creation and energy independence."
What are one or two specific things you have budget Chris Cuomo?
Josh Shapiro and has warned Vice President Kamala Harris that she should look elsewhere for a running mate.
And Pennsylvania's demographics are shifting.
Harris and Trump are tied at 47% when voters are asked who they trust more to handle abortion-related issues.
"What a disgrace that is that she waited so long allowing millions and millions of people to enter our country from prisons and jails, mental institutions and insane asylums."
"But the fact that they're finally admitting, oh, yeah, by the way, we're not looking good at Pennsylvania."
And then the ballots come out.
"I'm not going to get triggered by it, but it is funny."
He wasn't there at the debate on Thursday or on Tuesday night in Philadelphia.
He likes to talk about Kamala being vice president for years.
But just him as a person.
"But as a percent of the returns, they are down or at least they're going to be down by a lot."
"And that is, are you better off now than you were under the Trump administration four years ago?"
"Yes, abortion is in there somewhere, but it's not as important of an issue as it was in 2022, which again, you had a lot of gubernatorial races."
We got to take this to the finish line.
I'm not denying the idea that Kamala Harris is doing better than Biden.
Wanted to do something for the people of this country.
"One of those members of the board of supervisors that they're talking about, Bill Gates, actually, also received this orange prison jumpsuit in the mail today after she sent out that email calling for them to be put in jail."
The same trash pollsters that that does this every single year.
"And so the fact that the spending in Pennsylvania shows you it shows you that one, Pennsylvania is everything."
Nobody likes this woman.
Were you happy to see the swap?
And so it's a little off.
He sees Trump's legal troubles as political attacks that should be worn as a badge of honor and is more concerned about building up a ground game to turn out voters than the fact that Trump is now in court most days for his hush money criminal trial.
"Now you know that they're nervous because if you take a crawl across the internet right now, what do you see?"
Vance.
We don't have an official ground game as of yet.
She supports strengthening the Affordable Care Act and lowering the exorbitant cost of prescription drugs.
"I mean, there's a lot of great candidates that could easily get a Trump endorsement."
Here we go.
I love you back.
"And for me, as a Christian, a person of faith, for somebody that actively mocks another person for a disability, that's just completely contrary to what I believe."
I've been laughing as Bob Woodward is a man of a certain generation.
That was very pivotal.
And she's running against a guy who like literally votes against the interests of Pennsylvania all the time.
We would expect Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to go to Trump.
And talk about timing.
And she's offering her own set of proposals and vision for the country.
"And Trump making those, you know, outreaches to those service workers definitely has paid dividends and the Harris, you know, trying to steal Trump's policy thing kind of just blew up in her face a little bit."
So you go from 1.4 million to 500 K and you think you're doing good.
"And at another point, these morons came up with what they thought was a foolproof plan for escaping law enforcement."
"Not even, it's not even a vital organ."
"You have candidates to vote for in this election who demonstrate character, who know what real strength looks like, who will set a good example and will do the right thing and leave this country better than they found it."
It's very good work for the people that Kamala Harris traditionally doesn't give a shit about.
We've been through this.
She's she can very rarely.
But first I have to tell you guys about shop dot ready go politics dot com because the 2024 election is around the corner.
"It's Chester County, Pennsylvania."
"And not necessarily just the ones I put on, you know, we had six votes."
"But even then when you compare the final numbers in 2020 and 2016 to their numbers right now, you could argue this is bad for Harris because it's only Harris plus three."
"And I'm sure you saw Secretary of State Blinken saying, yeah, they're a couple weeks away from getting a bomb."
We're going to have to sit back and watch how everyone responds to this and see if everything I just said plays out which I know it fucking will but until then something in my stomach is telling me we're cooked we're so cooked.
And that's the issue of fracking.
It is not more restrictive.
"Well, in the last video, I mentioned the fact that he probably is, which is what it is."
"We're getting good numbers out of Arizona, looking like a plus eight Republican electorate."
Trump winning by 30 points.
"By ensuring that mail-in ballots are subject to strict requirements, the ruling may reduce the number of ballots that could otherwise be counted for Democratic candidates."
"A Washington Post probe, meanwhile, shows an election supervisor in Colorado accused of sneaking someone into county offices to copy voting system hard drives."
Her first responsibility in the job title is to these families.
It doesn't surprise me though.
She's a beautiful woman.
"Reporting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Jason Blair, Entity News."
"You're going to have, you know, different educational demography within that electorate and some of these pollsters, they can't exactly account for it."
Thank you so much from the White House.
"And that includes the power plant rule that came out in April, which would end the use of new natural gas power plants, unless they eliminate all their emissions, which is pretty much impossible."
1.
"I hate to see it happen, of course, but there are people in this country who were cheering for Custer, and there are people in this country who cheer for the Sioux."
"Well Anderson we do come to you from Allentown in the heart of the beautiful Lehigh Valley in eastern, Pennsylvania And we are with eight residents of the Lehigh Valley Who've been watching television with us tonight and watching Kamala Harris's speech?"
"Yeah, indeed."
What do these numbers say?
This election will likely come down to which candidate can best address the concerns of an increasingly polarized electorate.
"So you'd think with all those resources, they'd be able to turn things around pretty easily."
Now he appears to have earned a lot of national political capital in the last few weeks as well.
Did you hear that?
To what end the hearing?
"But at the at the risk of him endorsing Oz, it's not exactly what it is."
They're not a representation of trans people.
Just install the games on like a external hard drive and you'll have those games forever.
Um I don't know.
"We first met the duo, both of Dominican descent, before former President Trump survived an assassination attempt and picked JD Vance as his running mate."
"And Chris, I have to ask you what you make of this so-called audit that is happening in Arizona right now, this quest for bamboo ballots and so on as somebody who has called elections every four years."
"Trump lately started leading once more, even when Biden was still running before his catastrophe of a debate performance."
"Like I, I appreciate the fact that in the UK, you have elections that like only last a short amount of time."
Whether they consider this combative political season normal depends on who you ask.
"But Shapiro, I think whoever she chooses to be a good, uh, good person to go alongside her."
That'll be a big hit.
"That's the same guy, the one she's talking to with people going around with blue pens on the physical ballots."
 Rasmussen has Trump beating Harris by three points in Pennsylvania.
I hate to say this because I say it all the time.
It's like it's ridiculous like you're not getting anything You're not going anywhere.
And the Tesla CEO immediately took a pot shot at current U.S. President Joe Biden.
I don't think that's over skating it once everybody recognized two or three seconds in these might be gunshots.
A demographic that could be pivotal in November.
So what this is possibly saying is we're seeing Kamala Harris polls getting more skewed up.
And I think it's because people see that she's offering a positive vision for the country and rejecting the chaos and division of Donald Trump.
"Pennsylvania is worth as much as North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada combined I believe."
Has it started?
"And from what I hear, there was weird, weird coincidences."
"When everyone knows it's ridiculous, it's plus seven Dem sample, but it's like a weighted in a plus."
She looks like the most beautiful actress ever to live.
"And again, that's the best compliment we could get."
This requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges their struggles while promoting a forward-looking agenda that addresses economic and social issues in a meaningful way.
"I think folks saw the way Donald Trump did that job, which is why we kicked him out of office after four years."
"I mean, he's never received over 50 percent, so it's not a majority of the country, but about 48 percent of the country is prepared to vote for Donald Trump and those messages."
"Also, there's a $550 Maga Bling clutch, and one with his name on it, very classy."
He's a Trump voter.
We reached out to both campaigns and they both gave us different statements about their approach to the Latino vote.
That is fascinating.
"I'm sorry, I can't do that."
She's a strong candidate.
I'll put a new one in.
But I've had a great partnership with the Biden-Harris administration that's allowed me to do so much of this work.
"And there are also high-paying jobs, too."
This is a crucial state in Pennsylvania for the November election.
"Amish f conservative, their quali everything to them."
"Welcome to the Morning Agenda, WITF's daily news podcast, where the only agenda is you."
Both candidates are campaigning in Pennsylvania this week.
"It's not the popular vote, it's the electoral college."
We can say that here.
And you could probably tell why it's Harris plus one.
"I told my buddy, he said, I'll never vote for Donald Trump."
It makes sense.
Are y'all ready to address white and white crime?
"But if you look at the legislature, it's the only state in the country where Democrats have one chamber and Republicans have the other."
So it shows kind of that target group in a state that is completely up for grabs.
That's where you've got to go.
I've only voted for Barack Obama.
Republicans back Trump 91 to 7 percent.
So you're there.
"Because for instance, if we're seeing a poll that showed Biden down five across the state, and we see Kamala Harris now up either tied or up a few points, or down one point and massive improvements that are off minority groups, that Kamala Harris, as we've known from 2020 and 2024, has done, makes major improvements on relative to President Biden."
I still don't know what my debate plans are.
Did I?
"And as someone who spent the week before Election Day and the week after Election Day reporting outside that convention center, that was kind of at the focus of the 2020 campaign because it took longer to count the ballots there because there was a rule in place that you couldn't open mail-in ballots until Election Day."
And that was our opening question in the debate.
"Trust me, I'm going to be as happy as anybody."
That's a very difficult conversation.
"It was the ego, by the way, on the pickleball."
Pretty important this debate tonight.
And now you're talking about Kerry Lake because Kerry Lake is going to perform a lot better than the polls indicate.
"I do and she is, and again, I'd rather be us than them."
"I mean, I don't know."
The eleventh poll was conducted between October 7 and 10 by the New York Times Siena College among 857 registered voters.
Pennsylvania has flipped for Trump.
"What's going on in this election, and this is after the conviction, Donald Trump seeing a bump in the state of Pennsylvania in a pollster that is not friendly for him, and it's not friendly for Republicans, and it makes sense."
"But Cornel West now being on the ballot, absolutely huge, huge news."
"So all these things and, you know, then you figure what are the odds that that happened, right?"
He's got people with hard hats sitting there behind him.
We're being occupied by a criminal force.
"If you don't do that, mathematically speaking, you cannot win."
"Um, so I mean, it is what it is."
"I don't know about numbers, but I would probably I'd probably say is a few thousand people here."
Arizona visited Biden in 2020 at 0.3.
What a crowd.
I was crying last night because I'm so overwhelmed and blessed to be American.
We honestly do not know where they should go.
We don't want to see women in tragic situations where they're still carrying a baby that's no longer even viable and being forced to carry that baby until natural labor occurs because women have died that way.
"And like I said, it's pollsters like Mollenburg pollsters like the Washington Post, even Marist."

"As a truck driver, my husband normally fills his truck two to three times a week with diesel."
Now starts the surge.

But it would be the worst democratic performance in the 21st century.
"I'm the father of IVF, so I want to hear this question."
Donald Trump had a four point lead there.

And that's with a Democrat pollster and PPP.
That's not what Arizona wants.
Russell has donated a staggering $15 million to Kamala Harris' campaign.
Speak to that.
I'm remembering things I read over the last couple of months or so.
The Simpsons already have predicted he was going out in 2024.
He doesn't give a rat's ass about you and your grocery bill.
"Finally, down south, we have two more likely red states."
"And if Congress passes that bill, Kamala Harris will sign it in too long."
"They take, if somebody has two or three jobs, that counts towards lowering the unemployment."
"We can have our partisan choices for candidates, but the running of elections is something that really needs to be nonpartisan."
"Are you confident about the election infrastructure in your state, about the sort of these kind of county-level canvassing boards, any kind of mischief that folks in the Trump campaign might get up to to get people to not do what is essentially their legal duty to count certified votes?"
And I think it's something to where Donald Trump is making hay out of it.
"Like I said, he could volunteer to rescue puppies and kittens and they would still try to find a way to say he did something wrong."
"But so far, it's a very boisterous crowd, very aggressive."
"So he dropped out of the race, said he's going to support Trump, and then found out he can't get off the ballot."
"Urban centers like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are democratic strongholds, but the state's rural regions and smaller towns lean heavily Republican."
Far more numbers out there to support Kamala Harris.
"And that's why, and that's one of Donald Trump's key policy positions is to lower, get rid of the regulations."
They say she was a beautiful woman.
And it's unfortunate.
"And so after all these years, we know who Donald Trump is."
So this is the place where Democrats have a big anchor with their votes.
He'd have a sizable lead in Pennsylvania.
"Well, maybe he's had more pertinent information."
"Instead of stopping the attack while it was underway, he was busy calling up senators trying to get them to delay the count."
It's been exciting.
"Put that aside for a moment for all their criticisms of Federman, which include just making fun of the guy for a medical problem that he had."
Others were examined for possible smoke inhalation.
A lot of people look for it.
"You have unstable blades wobbling around as you shave, which causes the irritation."
"For each candidate, they will be simple triumphs."
"On Monday, she's doing three stops, one in Chester County, Pennsylvania, that was moderated by my Bullard colleague Sarah Longwell."
"All right, now a poll this week by a bipartisan group found that Harris's lead over Trump is 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent."
I think we're going to talk about one of those issues in a minute.
"Because think about it, Kamala Harris is currently running on the things that she's gonna do if she gets elected and she's in the White House."
"He's in a very, very good position."
Lin's donation reflects his confidence in Harris' ability to bring about meaningful financial reform.
And these companies on their prices and keep pointing out when they're jacking up their prices on food and household items and forcing people to pay higher prices just because they can get away with it because they can unless you have price gouging legislation passed.
The reason they did that was because that's the purest form of propaganda.
This is really a big line for Republicans right now.
Let's start with you How do you grade the speech?
It's below 64% Democrat and it's almost 26% Republican.
"You know Kamala Harris said just the other day in an interview that if she could do it all over again, what would she change?"
"Sources close to the campaign say it was Walz's leadership experience, his rapport with Harris and his communication skills that earned him the spot."
Hey.
So stick around.
So what in the campaign math makes you think that this is the best strategy right now to spend time in Trump country?
He was like basically vegetable.
"I've been saying that since the kindergarten, during the middle of our convention, that there wasn't this great surge in enthusiasm."
"Missed it entirely in Philadelphia, Detroit, and other key cities where black turnout in general was lower than it had been for President Obama and black men specifically."
What is happening?
Delaware is right next door to Pennsylvania.
"I do think things are looking very good in Michigan, and and now our memorial is great."
And it's like Kamala Harris's entire record just doesn't doesn't matter.
Go do your job.
Everything is aligning right now.
I want to ask you about kind of the new tactic of Kamala Harris as well.
And no tax on Social Security benefits for our seniors.
You got all these opinions.
"Harris, as far as we know, again, they've gone silent on all of these plans with EVs."
This is an absolute travesty.
"Joining me now is Stacey Abrams, voting rights activist and former Democratic leader of the Georgia House, who I know is watching that rally as well."
"They've got it within a point in the past, like five elections."
"You're seeing it in every single swing state, Arizona, Nevada, the Sunbelt, the Rust Belt."
Hopefully they go back to normal.
She needs to be running multiple points ahead.
So the average error in a presidential race nationally is 4 percentage points.
"Biden's approval rating, of course, has nosedived since then."
She never said a word about it in 2024.
And we're thrilled about the expansion of operations in Arizona.
This is a Harris point one Harris point five.
59% said employment would be lower.
And that's we have to respect that.
"And yet Sherrod Brown in their own internal polling seems to be pulling ahead of their Republican candidate, Bernie Moreno."
"Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will take their bus tour through central Pennsylvania this week, making multiple stops across the state."
You don't align with the political party at all during registration.
So hopefully things remain calm.
Trump wants no part of that because he sees the mainstream.
"However, we have the strongest economy in the world."
"But we try to keep things on issue, but yeah, I mean, economy and abortion number two by a hair, a whisker."
"Good to see you, my friend."
"If he happens to be a black person, the conversation we are having now, or conversation of him getting shot will have changed and there will be more focus on the conversation of the fact that the person will shot at him is a black person, which is absolutely true because we know how these things work."
"The last election with Joe Biden and President Donald Trump, Black women voted 90 percent for Joe Biden."
Never touches the human hand.
And I know you were talking to a pollster there or talking about the poll.
I know a lot of wives that would not say that.
"We don't know if those referrals will ultimately result in federal prosecutions, but that's what the attorneys general are asking for in those states."
We know that certain counties always vote blue so we can estimate how many people will be voting in that election and pretty much do the math across the whole state to calculate who the winner is going to be.
"We will then finish the likely states, which will have 7 to 15 point margins of victory."
Cause you guys know the way it works and you vote in the primary.
But they're both okay.
It's one of the most important messages of the entire campaign.
"I'll bring the Philly cheesesteaks next time, Kenneth."
"And so you'll see a significant drop off of the people in power, in this case, the Democrats and a significant increase in the people out of power."
"We know Arizona is a Trump lean and we know Nevada now has gone to 50 after Harris was the favorite when you look at the bedding and everything like that and you look at this, it hasn't even been put in."
"If anything controversy can be good for sports or just look at the viewership ratings for the Olympics, which became a culture war flashpoint during the opening ceremony."
"But energy industry workers have chimed, chimed in on Fox Business Live coverage."
"So we got significant majority don't approve of Snippy, and yet a significant majority do approve of Lormoger Shapiro."
Latino voters especially.
I'm not defending.
Just huge.
Can you point to those specific differences on those key issues?
"They had Biden up by seven, eight, 13, eight points."
The border is an issue.
I mean that meant lots of people.
Don't vote for somebody who does not respect you.
Kamala says things that we don't like.
"And with a full field, it's, you know, Harris plus one."
"Some of that, I think, is from the old idea that, well, a woman wouldn't be tough enough to stand up to world leaders like Putin and she and Kim."
"And if what he meant is taking responsibility, well then yeah, he should take responsibility for the fact that one in three women in America lives in a Trump abortion ban, same."
It's all good.
"And I cannot also ignore the fact that Tim Walz being added onto the ticket has done phenomenally, found a phenomenal thanks for Kamala Harris's campaign."
There is the problem that we have.
Like she didn't feel heard at all.
But I am reviewing my plans this weekend for the debate and I'm really looking forward to it because Donald Trump is not doing any prep whatsoever.
And I think ultimately that is going to be what people will remember about him.
"That's why I said, I don't care what political party you're from, this MAGA thing is different."
"And so you saw earlier up here, it's not just the Latinos, Latinx community that they're struggling with, maybe because they keep calling them Latinx."
It's it's offensive.
"They are a left-leaning pollster, and they found the race at best tied for Harris."
"So Trump is still walking free despite what you would think is overwhelming evidence of his guilt, including the fact that he fomented a violent insurrection to overturn an election that resulted last week in seditious conspiracy charges against some of the key militia figures involved."
I'm a PC master racer.
"Sir, yes, sir."
You tell them everything.
"Number one, they're grossly incompetent."
"Akayla, thank you again."
He was able to emerge defiantly and continue on in the campaign.
Trump finished one point ahead of Harris in this poll.
So they're all Harris Walls supporters.
Even Joe Biden spoke to Time at a similar length before dropping out of the race.
Morning Consult is ridiculous and all over the place.
"There was a recent judicial decision with regards to the certification of the election there, which I find hilarious."
"I'm gonna tell you something, if Steve Bannon and I had organized that, we would have won."
How do you think it resonated with folks?
"You're just mad whenever you lose, even though Mark Zuckerberg admitted in a letter to Jim Jordan that, yeah, I mean, I mean that letter is earth shattering."
"And all signs are kind of pointing to Pennsylvania being the key here, right?"
There's a man.
"Now, former President Trump has been critical of these policies in the past."
"Well, in our estimates, Harris is getting the same percent of support among black voters that Joe Biden got in 2020."
"And in this period, Hillary Clinton was up like 10 points, eight points, a ridiculous amount in the polling in Pennsylvania."
That's going to make sure every child of God gets a shot.
"Okay, I'm sorry."
"Still, he is definitely going to prevail."
My son and I were having frequent and unexplained headaches and my daughter had very high lead levels in her blood work.
And then Bloomberg morning counter poll Trump is also up by two.
There you go Listen before I let you go.
You covered the Philadelphia suburbs.
"Camara Bartolotta, a state senator who represents Washington County, Pennsylvania, which includes the town of Charleroi, became concerned about the lies being told about the immigrant community."
"Well, I think what some people forget is there was a bipartisan bill that was ready to be voted on, and Trump sort of killed it."
Let's talk with the guys to do this job every single day.
Election experts raise fresh alarms.
"That's the big news of this episode, how the media is turning on Kamala Harris for the first time in the last couple of days."
"Northeastern Pennsylvania, Harris's prospects are dicier."
There's actually still a bit of undecidedness among leading Republicans.
"Yeah, no, this is madness."
"Good morning, Earl."
So I don't know if there might be some kind of weird missed vote that we can kind of run into.
"In Arizona, Trump winning by 30 plus points."
Particularly in the Miami-Dade area.
Republicans talk about challenging in Illinois.
"And in the past election, Arizonans voted for President Biden and to replace both incumbent senators for the first time in decades."
"Man, it's a lot of work."
President Trump is himself.
"Caitlin Huey Burns, thank you so much."
"By that means she was really the only reporter, as far as we know, who was able to get herself inside the room."
"I don't know what the equivalent would be in Australia, but if you picked a traditional sort of liberal seat and then have labor spend a lot of time there, that's what Kamala Harris is doing in Georgia."
"And that takes into account the past four years of Biden's record, which she's basically tied to with the hip."
"It is true that they're tied in the state right now, but that means that Donald Trump is actually winning because he typically underperforms in public opinion polls and does better on election day."
"And former President Trump, you're right."
"Usually Virginia has been moving right, but Harris simply scores six points today."
"So we're here with Jack, live at Butler PA."
They gathered a group of Latinos to talk about those issues.
So why are Gen Z voters so important this year?
It is nonstop.
We've got the Trump iconic design.
"If you don't know who they are outside of their state, sure, he could potentially help Harris win Pennsylvania."
Like the vetting process of her is happening in just a matter of hours.
"But just to be clear, did you have any conversations with him about that or did you consult in any way kind of as this process was playing out?"
"So first of all, can you believe, I mean, this makes perfect sense."
"Once of a court case, I've now confirmed that the dating of a mail-in ballot envelope when election officials can already confirm it was sent and receive it then the legal voting window provides no purpose election administration, the Department of State said in the release."
" Speaking of Donald Trump, take a look at this moment from yesterday at a grocery store in Pennsylvania."
There is no way.
We are fighting for peace and prosperity for the American people.
Thompson's contribution is a testament to his confidence in Harris' ability to lead the nation to economic prosperity.
We're going to make it better than ever.
Are you planning on voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz?
He's pointing out her flip flop and even warning during the last debate that fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one if she's elected.
But that's so short sighted and they're not looking at the long term and what will come because with Kamala Harris presidency will come these EV mandates and it will be a long term demise of the auto industry.
I like the idea of of of walls saying it's not political to be for political for public education.
"Please comment, like, subscribe, and tell people about the channel."
Then they want to support family farmers and quote help ensure future generations of American farmers can thrive by helping beginning farmers get more access to credit and connecting them with all sorts of training and technical assistance.
Thank you very much

That would be my stance is I'm against it.
"Some people will try to take a look at early voting numbers, but that can really go awry."
"And the challenge, though, is that it's really hard to have a plan when, as President Biden has said, with 50 senators, with 50 Democratic senators, every single one of them is a president."

"So she's preparing prior to that as opposed to reacting, right?"
"Donald Trump left office with net loss of 3 million jobs, with a 6.3% unemployment rate, with an economic contraction of 3.4%."
But the other story is crossover voters.
"Rallies three months before an election don't win campaigns, but how dramatically has the presidential race been reshaped here in Arizona since President Joe Biden ended his campaign just three weeks ago."
How did that happen?
We want to be tough on immigration.
"He's he's technically not dropped out He's suspended his campaign in swing states is gonna stay on the ballot in blue and red states So that's gonna give her a boost so Cornell not being on these ballots is absolutely huge These margins are gonna be really small like in the state of Michigan, for example, you know, the margin was 0.23% so We can actually take a look here over at the you know polls right now in Pennsylvania So in the polls in Pennsylvania right now Harris is up by 1.8 Which is solid, but I do believe if she wishes to wish to win the state of Pennsylvania She's gonna have to perform better than this."
It's a presidential year.
They've got the cash.
"And this 13 DNC again, we just saw one from his 13 DNC and we heard the audio, but look at this year, hell to the chef."

You can cherry pick a few words or lines out of a two-hour event.
"First up, Donald Trump zigzagged between economic remarks and personal insults at a rally in critical Pennsylvania."
And we've never had anything like it.
But if you add all the Biden and Haley voters up together and you compare it to the Trump vote Donald Trump would technically win the state by 21 points based off of Trump and not Trump and that's giving all the Haley voters to Biden which is not entirely probably the way that it's going to go in November and you can extrapolate from this is the main point.
We'll see how that turns out.

I'm not too worried about the people around this table.
"What do you say to those Republicans who simply say, listen?"

"And now Harris is leading Trump here by five points when every other poll except for one has the race at three, at two points or under, aside from USA Today, which had it at three points or under and a 4.4 percent margin of error."
"Now, some people, because I'm having conversations around the country with folks as I go campaigning, and I'll hear some people say, you know, well, I remember the economy when those first two years with Trump, they were pretty good."
So a complete disconnect between what they're saying publicly and what's actually happening behind the scenes.

It's not as if there is a movement within people who are actively involved in the party to do anything but be the party of Trump right now.
"And the politicians who are good at this and Governor Josh Shapiro is one of them and his predecessor was, too."

And they kicked me out of the polling center.
"I mean, to that point, we absolutely should talk about the record."
"We just saw him at a Moms for Liberty event, where he went on long-winded tangents that were not entirely coherent, far from factual."
That's pretty much the election.
"I will tell you this Arizona story, like I said, I did not expect to be seeing it, to be covering it again tonight after we covered it last night."

" Hello, public opinion aficionados, and welcome to RAS Muscle Report, the independent pollster who is the arch nemesis of MSNBC."
The liberal bastion.

I know that I would be getting nervous if I were a Democrat right now simply looking at the polling.

Harris plus four.
"You know, they're exhausted with all of his complaints about January 6."
"On health care, Harris has been a vocal advocate for expanding access to affordable and quality coverage."
They kind of give you a gauge on what certain subsets of the population are thinking.
"But in the end, immigration, inflation, reproductive health care and the fate of American democracy, those are the issues that show up again, again, again at the top four of lists of voters in our surveys and everyone else's major."
They are driving both chaos at the same time where they are selling order.
Would anybody else like to?
The state's expected to be so close that the slightest change from last time could really make a difference.
The voter registration numbers look good.

"For Trump, freedom is getting away with stuff."
"As such, they are now considered firmly Republican-leaning, and while we don't yet have a poll between Trump and Harris and Iowa, the latest survey in Ohio has Trump up 10 points over Harris 52% to 42% among 600 likely voters."
We need more stuff like this.
"And that is just a bad phrasing, right?"
I think there's gonna be a big turnout every place.
"Before we move on to the polls, subscribe to the channel for free right now and like the video."
Trump said Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother.
Early voting is underway in a dozen states.
"It's really, I think, insulting people in an election like this when so much is on the line."
They go well.
I'm here to support my mother She's a huge Trump fan and I just thought I should be there to support her.
"I don't know where she gets this because for four years, Donald Trump was the president of the United States."
"If this keeps up, I'm not saying that's for sure going to happen."
"The stakes are incredibly high, and the outcome will have a profound impact on the future of the country, influencing policies and the direction of the nation."
That's a seven point swing and 44% of likely voters had a favorable view of opinion of Donald Trump while 53% have an unfavorable opinion.

That's the way it goes.
"Of course not Pennsylvania can absolutely go to Harris, but these numbers are so bad for Democrats that it makes you really wonder how likely is it that Harris could actually win Pennsylvania because it's not just one metric."
This video is from hours before the rally that I'm showing you.
"I think she exposed the former president for being kind of nonsensical and unhinged and sort of baited him into doing what he normally does, which is speaking in conspiracy theory tones."
And it's only going to get worse because the parties are so divided ideologically.
"Another poll shows this, 53 percent of Americans in this poll say Trump would do a better job with the economy compared to just 44 percent for Harris."
"And people filed out of that auditorium, or that space, wherever that was."

"This from Suffolk, a B rated pollster, likely voter 914."
"It's because people, because of how bad inflation is, they're telling on their themselves, their own arguments are counterproductive."
Let me put it this way.
"Trump's rally aimed to energize conservative, white working-class voters in a key battleground state, emphasizing his disdain for the Biden administration's handling of inflation and fracking."
"So whether it's that practical stuff or whether it's his work to undermine democracy, I think Perry is really vulnerable."

I understand that he's a sore loser.
"107,000."
The suburbs of Ohio have also been a key battleground in recent elections.
"It's 80,555 votes in the state of Pennsylvania."
"And that's why you're seeing the Republicans who are actually involved in the election coming out and saying, no, none of this is true."
We have a lot of topics we want to get to.
"It really I think further diminished At least print political journalism and we were writing about what was going on on TV all the time but that really that rose was really the beginning of the change and With the internet came the explosion of media sites that everybody could start to really Good silo themselves with sites that perhaps spoke to their own political preconceptions and so the old Gatekeepers which was New York Times Washington Post maybe Wall Street Journal somewhat the LA Times ABC NBC CBS those were the main gatekeepers Well, their impact started to really diminish and that fragmentation has accelerated ever since to where we are today What what Kamala Harris has done this week was a perfect example of what I'm talking about that the mainstream outlets They all want interviews whether you know, which basically it's like, you know, we're the professional journalists We know the most about issues."
Take a look.
You think they would practice for this stuff.
"We need a stern president, somebody that's healthy, somebody that can speak for the people."
"Well, you heard Nancy talk about this very effectively a few moments ago."
Really.
That's it.

"And if you're coming down on the side of, let's call them what they are, coup attempts, insurrections, I don't know how we begin to have a civil conversation until we get past that point."
"Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris leads Trump across nationwide polls."
She beat Donald Trump in the debate and she's had some good polling numbers off that.
It's a wrap for our country.
"Here in Arizona, the estimated 15,000 people at Harris's Rockis Glendale rally took part in what's believed to be Arizona's largest rally for a Democratic candidate."

Half the place left.
"One from her Twitter account in 2016 reads, quote, don't we get it?"
"You get the sense that both campaigns need every demographic, and they're trying to get every vote they can."
"Jen Fifield, reporter for the Arizona Republic, doing some intrepid work today in a really strange environment, operating with really strange constraints, but reporting out something that was of huge importance about what you viewed today, despite the narrow lens you were given to look through."

The good news is he didn't endorse David McCormick.
We talk about a lot of stuff.
Southern Pennsylvania.
I don't think it's fair that there's so much expectation put on her and very little put on Donald Trump when it comes to debate.
I go to Erie all the time.
"And, you know, it's a state that's very, very prosperous, very successful."
"Both campaigns are looking to reach former president Trump after spending the weekend doubling down with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and suggesting he would use the military against his foes tonight, turning to the economy as well."
Trump is taking Pennsylvania.
Your pathway to the presidency is not multiple pathways.
"The poll surveyed 950 likely voters, a solid sample size for gauging public opinion, and it found that President Trump and Vice President Harris are in a dead heat, each receiving 50 percent of the Vote.Michigan status as a swing state is no surprise."
"And by the way, tomorrow, big day, tell us about what, what the people you talk, but you're a farm."
They didn't have full access for voter signature acuity and documentation and accuracy.
"So the question is, what's going on?"
Former President Trump appeared in two televised town halls.
He's a longtime former member of the Army National Guard.
"The coalitions are not as fixed as it seems, right?"
Certainly that's what the Biden campaign hopes will do or at least drive voters to do exactly what you just described.
That's on private land.
"If it's worth saying, I think most of us can agree on is that these McDonald's fries are good."
"Because at the end of the day, they need her for their own political benefits."
Now let's continue.

There have been some recent positive indicators for good movement here on the economy.
"Even though her last words were, I don't want this!"
"And I think at this point she can only go upwards by being herself, being moderate and being strong."
These are slim margins in the battleground states.
This will be the second time vote.
Your governor has character.
He also defeated Georgia 0.24.
"In my race, I think Kamala Harris is about close to that."
"Like, insider polling, which did drop a couple days ago, but they found Trump plus two."
And is the Harris campaign doing that?
"No, thank you for the service."
And how is Vice President Harris responding?
So that's the number one path.
"For this reason, the candidate with the most votes in Pennsylvania on election night will take an important step towards the presidency."
"And basically how it works is that if Biden doesn't win Pennsylvania, the chances of him and Trump going to a 269-269 electoral college tie is exponentially higher."
But just be fair for the most part.
"But Kamala Harris, as generally her campaign has been operating, is actually operating in a proactive manner as opposed to a reactive manner."
"One thing is certain, this race is far from over."
Sometimes you'll have days where Democrats do a little bit better.

"Nyle Scanage, White House columnist at The Hill, among a number of other titles at our sister publication."
And I'm seeing it this morning as well with Vice President Harris unveiling new policy proposals that are also directly targeted at helping black men.

"See you, Brian."
"The replacement, it's paper, but it's paper on steroids."
So I'm looking forward to November.
"Jeff Gunter was stronger, but he didn't really have much of a chance."

He is completely out of step with the values and views of Pennsylvanians.
"Anthony, this isn't the first poll in recent weeks to show that the two candidates are neck and neck in Pennsylvania, which is considered perhaps the most coveted battleground in this year's election."
Pennsylvanians don't value extremism.
But all the other kind of progressive support both in state and nationally is behind Jamie McLeod Skinner who very well may knock Schrader out.

And that was the final one before the election ended up being 1.2 percentage points.
"And of course, you're at the checkout line there."
Their trial is set to begin in January.
"I mean, the guy gets so high off cocaine, he smokes Parmesan cheese, but still, it doesn't matter."
And Kamala Harris has said many times over that she wanted to ban fracking and transition energy workers.
I think that's perfect.
"So in Texas, currently, they have a piece of legislation that wouldn't do anything."
The protests were mostly peaceful.
"It all starts all over again so four more years of that and with that I think we're good to wrap things up for this edition of Let Me Finish so for Catherine Swartz, Audrey Falberg and myself."
We're still choosing establishment candidates.
And you're already seeing Donald Trump obviously talk about this as a campaign issue.
"Shapiro added an additional indication of the ideological split that exists between the two parties when he compared this accomplishment to Trump's Project 2025, which has the purpose of eliminating the Department of Education."
"This broader impact could help secure more favorable voting conditions in key states, potentially benefiting Trump's campaign across multiple fronts."

"And Secretary Clinton, I think she focused too much time in Philadelphia and just Pittsburgh."
Let's just be real clear.
Voter turnout will be crucial in Pennsylvania.
All other listed candidates are showing single digit probabilities.
Say what you want about Biden.
I don't think it matters where the foreign purchaser would be.

What matters is these good paying blue collar jobs have been going away.
"It can be misleading, especially in a state like Pennsylvania because well, there's a bunch of ancestral Democrats in the Commonwealth, especially in the western half of the state."
"Look that way, three point two."
"And so final note here, these battleground state polls continue to build on this very, very long standing story since the moment that she was announced as the contender for president of the United States is that this momentum is growing."
"So that's um, That's the thing is It's a bit concerning for Kamala Harris that you have Bob Casey running those ads You see the polling you see no connection with Catholics that Biden had a lot of connection with He was dubbed as the third senator And I'm not saying they should have stuck with Biden Biden didn't have much of a chance after the debate But you do see a general concern for the common Harris campaign I've even heard Mark Halpern say that of all the seven swing states It's her sixth hardest to win and who knows if that's true But I've heard concerns about it and you can even look at Paulie market, which Trump is that 57% now Why is that why and obviously there's still a good portion of things common will win the state of Pennsylvania But I think it's because of all I've outlined Trump is surged recently in Pennsylvania and I think it's because she's a scarily bad fit and I wouldn't panic But it is not a good sign."
"The need for stronger immigration reforms, some of the economic concerns that he has on trade and inflation and he was very critical obviously of Kamala Harris's policies and what he believes she would bring to the country if she's elected president."
They're about having sex.
You might be voting for Harris.
If you haven't seen the picture I don't think I can post that on TikTok without it getting taken down but it's a money shot let me tell you not the shot shot but the photo shot.
Is that is that the correct way to describe it?

National security people.
"Indeed, when Arizona Republic reporter Jen Fifield emerged from her weird volunteer shift this evening, she had this to report before dashing to meet her print deadline."
They stop and they jostle with him on the street.
And every single data driven forecast out there gives Trump or Harris a better than 90% chance of winning them.
 This is Inside the Right.
"And the fact that they continue and you don't hear they're going out on strike, they're going to this day don't do that."
Now these guys are not going to die.
There is a very big difference between Donald Trump and how I will be president of the United States.
 So this election season 12 News is talking to groups of voters who could make a big difference in what's expected to be a very close race.
I think his passions really came out.
Kamala Harris is going around the country bragging.
"If I was McDonald's, I'd go for it."
Thanks so much for your analysis there.
"If if Donald Trump does not win the election, do you think he's going to admit that he lost?"
"But here's a question to ponder, can Harris's newfound momentum in the suburbs of Pennsylvania and among younger voters carry her past Trump's formidable base?"
"Kamala Harris has shown to not only bolster excitement amongst the Democratic coalition, she's also shown to expand that base and its reach, particularly with Gen Z, a lot of younger diverse voters were seeing the attacks on women's reproductive rights that have fallen flat for the right and they consistently continue to do so."
"If you permit me just for a second, I'm going to tell my crew, Hey guys, we're going to go, we're going to go up back up because I want to show you exactly what it looks like from a higher vantage point here."

Did you put the tape over Mike Pence's name because you believe he should have refused to certify the election results?
It's North.
I don't think she understands Pennsylvania.
"Republicans, as we get closer to Election Day, they're actually requesting even more ballots."
"Rosemary, unbelievable."
How's it looking now?
And today was day one.
"With the election just weeks away, is there enough time for the Harris campaign to salvage their chances in Pennsylvania?"
"Now, if that's the way the country's feeling, well, the numbers really haven't caught up yet."
And now this.
It was Biden's narrowest margin of victory that year in terms of total numbers of votes.
They said they want to secure the border.
Now just because you are registered as a Republican means nothing.
Do we want an administration that is based on that type of non-integrity?
"And while you guys are up here, I also want to introduce the a great guy and a very big man in the world of law enforcement, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police Patrick Yost, representing 400000 law enforcement, largest in the country by far law enforcement officers."

"And she'll be doing that in an appearance with Charlamagne the God, the radio host for the breakfast breakfast club talking about all of those things."
"There's mechanics, there's restaurants, there's bars, there's truck drivers."
"I was a straight reporter No opinion and I had to kind of you know, I was trained to sort of remove myself in that sense and be dispassionate But I got to the point after 16 years where I felt I knew enough about politics I knew enough about how these people You know strategized Where I really wanted to have more of my own voice because I always liked writing with style So that's why I kind of I moved to commentary because I felt at that point That I had earned enough I had earned enough experience to be able to sort of say what I thought was really was really going on And you know and that's obviously a little bit tricky for some readers because then you get people who are really get angry with your point of view And but I was you know, I was fine with that and I still am And so I've been writing commentary ever since and it obviously it is partisan in the sense that you know, I think you know One side is more correct than the other side But as I try to emphasize I really really believe this that I don't see this as Democratic Democrat versus Republican I see this as facts and truth versus untruths and lies and to me that is you know that to me is the dividing line and if it's partisan to say that factual reality Should be the priority and if it's partisan to say that lies Wrong, then I guess that makes me a partisan In 1988 you wrote the making of an image for the inquirer about the GOP's pioneering TV attack ads How has the role of political journalism changed during your lifetime along this evolving media landscape?"
Keep it tight.
And she wasn't stopping there.
The appearance was more than just a parade.
And it's just one poll.
"You know, the weird thing."
Wouldn't you want to do that?
"He, of course, grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania."
It doesn't matter what happens in Michigan.
"She would answer it, but then she would quickly pivot and almost bait Donald Trump into speaking about another issue."
"And then from American Pulse Research and polling, we have Trump with a slight lead on Harris on those two polls."
"When President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Kamala Harris stepped in, democratic enthusiasm went up."
"Anthony, take us deeper into this poll and illuminate for us why these two might be so close."
"As you all know, the problem with the softball interviews, you still got to be able to hit a softball."
And I appreciate you all coming out the day before homecoming.
 Good evening from New York.
"Republicans in Pennsylvania are dramatically overstayed or understated, I should say."
I can.
"But with Trump hitting plus two every single week in a row for a month, it doesn't look like the next month is going to be exciting."
I will always stand with the incredible men and women of Border Patrol.
So let's see where they're at.
"With politics aside, fracking has been positive, I would say, all around."
Donald Trump calling Kamala Harris not a smart woman.
So the Republican electorate advantage in Arizona in 2020 was around four points and Trump barely lost the state by less than a point.
"And now, and then Joe Biden, and my campaign manager in 16 was the manager for Pennsylvania for Joe Biden."
"If you recall, that's the state that put Joe Biden over the top in 2020."
That's your easiest pathway to winning.
I'm gonna afford a house one day I want us Democrats focus a lot about on abortion specifically what they call women's health Is that an important issue to you guys?
This is me forever and ever.
So he has to drag her down.
He's a liability.
And this is a sample?
"I don't know if she's claiming that her Twitter account was hacked, but it's on her official Twitter account."
So we're just a couple of weeks out from the Democratic National Convention.
Okay.
The most recent example is hurricane relief.
Do you guys think this was the right move for Trump?
"You know, those are people that have led extraordinary lives and have done extraordinary things for our country."
"Pennsylvania is home to more than a million Latinos and as far as those that are registered to vote, that number is in the six figures."
"All the people that are trying to kill him, you know, just to show him that you can't stop this movement."
So for the purpose of the presidential election what we're concerned with are the counties okay like this.
"So this is why the vice president Kamala Harris just says, let Trump's talk, speaking, do the arguments for them."
But they do it with the Supreme Court justices.
Make no mistake.
So I think Kamala Harris needs to deliver that message to the American people and deliver that message to young voters.
You got into a car accident.
"And if after you've gone through that and the folks who are unconvinced say, yeah, I don't know, I still like him, then I think you have to then say, yeah, but what about character?"
"When small financial rewards were added, that jumped to 28 percent, and the participants kept up their changed behavior around phone use even after the game ended."
"Thank you, Abe."
He's their leader.
I don't like how he talks about women and that's the only reason why probably I would not vote for him.
So glad that we could get you on.
"Sorry, July 2021, not July 20th, massive gains for Kamala Harris and overall approval."
"I'm convinced that we are gonna win the White House, the Senate, and the House, and we're gonna have a very aggressive agenda to get the economy going again, to help everyone."
Joining us now for more is NBC News legal analyst Danny Sivallos.
I do not take any responsibility at all.
"Republican Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a longtime Trump supporter, testifying Tuesday to the House January 6 Committee."
"But overall, it's pretty stagnant as to how that vote is actually moving."
Donald Trump is going to gain significantly out of the gate.
It should.
"A good morning to you, it is Wednesday, September 25th, and this is being recorded at 5.18 a.m."
It's incredible Scott how quickly that crowd emptied out when we were talking just moments ago.
It's a new time.
"So whatever you can do it, I'm gonna really that I could push anything is to get Governor Walsh."
You click on the MSNBC app.
I'll get your reaction on the other side.
Thanks for tuning into our video.
That is our responsibility.
We saw it in the focus groups afterwards.
Every single one of them shows a shift towards Trump.
"And he's, as you heard there from my answer, that was his reaction when Roe was overturned, saying it would made him very, very happy."
"So Arizona, I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard?"
81 days out.
"OK, my family fled a communist regime."
"And when Trump says that the other survey data shows more crime, he's not saying that it's relative to 2020."
"In 2019, I believe, at a town hall, you said you were asked, would you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on your first day in office?"
He's ranting and rambling until people get bored and leave his rallies.
You call what happened in Arizona overnight a crippling low for the claims that the former president has made.
We're a failing nation.
"According to a poll conducted between October 3 and 7, 2024, by Marist College, which surveyed 1,327 likely voters, Trump holds a commanding lead over Harris, with 52 percent of the vote compared to Harris's 46 percent, giving Trump a six-point advantage."
Let me press you on that a little bit because I hear what you're saying.
"Nathaniel, thanks for joining us."
"With its diverse electorate, Pennsylvania remains a microcosm of the broader national political landscape."
"I think the more he can stick to those issues, I think the better off that he is going to be as he goes forward."
It was very much the same place where it was between Trump and Biden.
So he has essentially decided to ignore the advice of his campaign staff and go on this massive bender at both his Pennsylvania rally and also online.
It means that Donald Trump needs to win one of three States in order to become president.
"The sixth poll was conducted between September 12th and 16 by Quinnipiac University among 1,331 likely voters."
 There are people increasingly writing to me and they are mad at me.
"So I don't know if that just kind of shakes out, and that's something we see every four years, or what exactly."
You want to see more about this?
"Here's is literally flipping burgers, literally flipping burgers."
But they should be revoked.
"He wants you to believe that if you let him round up whoever he wants and ship him out, all your problems will be solved."
"And it included traffickers, women."
You were asking me to do something against my oath and I will not break my oath.
"I think that one, she's had a great team to campaign on her behalf."
"OK, you told me something in the break, Amy."
Time Magazine doesn't have a picture of her.
"Now, if you challenge Trump or J.D."
Her argument?
"He has a connection there and he was gonna be beaten there badly because after the debate his campaign was just collapsing but You know, obviously Harris is better than 2024 Biden is she as good as 2020 Biden?"
FBI agents on the ground and snipers on adjacent roofs.
"Alright, so let's take a look at this particular map."
"Remember January 6th, police officers were killed."
Nearly 5 million Americans have already cast their ballots in this election.
It's been such an unexpected change.
It's not true.
The fifth poll was conducted between September 16th and 22 by Susquehanna Polling and Research among 700 likely voters.
It's easier to go live.
They're ambivalent.
"But we'll have to see what happens on the Nevada front, on the Michigan front."
"Alright, so according to reports, top Democratic officials in Pennsylvania are concerned that Kamala Harris is losing ground in the state of Pennsylvania."
"2017 Republicans are plus one, a seven point swing from 2020 to 2024."
"Now, later in the day today, the former American president Barack Obama is expected to rally for the Democrat presidential nominee."
I can't be poor.
And she even played those comments on a big screen in the arena.
"I mean, you know, you're seeing events that, you know, moderate Republicans, Republicans for Harris, Republicans for a guy."
"Joining us now White House reporter for Bloomberg, Akayla Gardner."
You'd be counting the ballots cast on election day and you'd simply push a button in each of the counties to get the other results from the mail in ballots.
"They've had their best days are behind them I've heard I've heard it described as a sugar high Right the Democrats and D's are on a sugar high Okay, so when's it wear off?"
And it would make sense.
"Thank you, Caitlin."
So that's a big deal.
This is the lone swing state voting for Trump in both of the past two elections located up in North Carolina.
And make sure you go to join NN dot com to find News Nation on your television provider.
"I can't wait to see what else you come out with, whether it's news, music or skateboarding."
Try to lay low and avoid attention.
The irony being of course AIPAC has funded and is supporting more than 100 Republicans who voted to not certify the election.
I don't think it's indicative necessarily of his actions in terms of Fanny.
Keung law.
I can't believe they say it all the time.
And so they're working hard to figure out what to do about that.
"... Well, today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which means it's a day full of Republican politicians who support voter suppression efforts and have spent months fanning a crazed right-wing panic over so-called critical race theory, deceptively quoting Dr. King out of context like the new governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin, who signed an executive order banning the teaching of critical race theory on his first day in office and then went on Fox News and quoted Dr. King."
Voter fraud never happens.
This reflects the strong support Trump has built among voters who prioritize border security and tougher immigration policies.
It's not.
I know.
That's real.
"Now, the audit is saying that the Maricopa County allowed people to vote who shouldn't have been allowed to vote."
"Unfortunately, that was under his administration."
"More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been caught at the border and then released into the United States."
And so I think it's going to be incredibly close.
"Single-handedly, Donald Trump single-handedly changed the Republican Party from what it was."
Well that remains to be seen as you know Nora but certainly a very spirited conversation among these voters as they watch tonight's debate but clearly not all of their answers were not all of their questions were answered tonight so that is why I know that they should hear more.
What was it outside of Nevada in 2016?
And I just think the reality is that we have seen a movement towards Vice President Harris among these kind of former disaffected Republican types.
"Harris, in her bid to win over white voters, has worked tirelessly to reshape her image and bridge the gap on key issues, particularly fracking."
"Oh, oh my gosh."
I want one.
It the likelihood is.
"Some of them are not even applying for aid they're eligible for because they believe that, well, there's no point because I'm not going to get help."
"The third poll was conducted between September 16 and 19th by Redfield and Wilton Strategies among 1,286 likely voters."
I gave him lunch.
Some of that money actually is a point in China.
And and so he is extremely concrete in terms of and she by making this choice.
That's a point two margin.
"Yes, he did."
All candidates were included in this poll.
"And the Harris campaign really clipped that moment, pushed it out on social media."
"Now, a lot of people might think that it has because they look at an electoral map and they say, oh, this area has become a lot more red in these other counties."
"I was kind of hoping that we would address more about our broken immigration system since we really haven't had substantial immigration reforms since the 1980s and even further back to 1960s and a lot of those decisions made in the 1960s and 1980s have caused this immigration problem that we currently have right now and I was kind of hoping that both of them would talk about immigration and how they would fix immigration but while Trump attempted to say that there is a problem with immigration and that those that have come here legally should be deported, she really deflected on immigration and didn't take responsibility or bind responsibility for letting people in illegally."
Just what is the scene like when you see the former president there?
Cross your fingers.
Go subscribe to the Clay Travis Enbuck section show network today.
"And Glenn, I've watched Glenn for a long time."
These states are supposedly the most competitive on the map.
"Agree to disagree, shake hands, and just be nice either way."
"So if Harris is winning Pennsylvania, there's a good chance of the bare minimum she's up in Michigan, where at that point, yeah, she just needs one more state."
"Former President Donald Trump is also fighting to hold support in western Pennsylvania, where energy is a key industry."
"Called on election night, no consideration in these battleground states, Trump was in it to win it."
"And even, you know, you expect to see it in the rural and suburban areas."
Even Hawaii has entered the mix for some reason and I'm not saying Trump can't dabble in some of these states from time to time.
Pennsylvania is not a sure bet for Democrats.
"In the second poll, conducted by SoCal Strategies on August 23rd, with 800 registered voters, Harris received 47% of the vote, while Trump also received 47%."
"That's right Casey's leading the effort to stop corporate greedflation and price gouging Casey booked Biden to protect fracking And he's sided with Trump to end NAFTA and put tariffs on China to stop them from cheating So in this house, we agree."
So let's dive into this Trump endorsed Dr. Oz in the Senate race.
"If you're a Republican, don't get too anxious yet because Republicans are expected to not vote early."
Do I think that Donald Trump can run the table on all six of these states?
I've had people criticize Donald Trump.
They think it's okay so long as their side wins.
Real quick.
"Oh, when I go through hell, I'd have a week of hell if I ever tried to do that."
"But we're going to start with CBS News political correspondent Caitlin Huey Burns in Butler, Pennsylvania."
"And in this poll, Quinnipiac had Biden at 54, Trump at 41, a plus 13 margin."
"Now, I am not saying it's a foregone conclusion Trump's gonna win Pennsylvania."
"Well, look, I think that the message to them is like, is Donald Trump even talking about anything you care about?"
He suffered a stroke just days before the primary.
"God, I know maybe a little bit hard for you to hear me because you're in the middle of that crowd."
We got two weeks to go.
Vance has been on TV constantly and he does a lot of press conferences as well.
" Joining me now to talk more on the ground there is Congressman Mike Kelly, a Republican there in Butler, Pennsylvania, also your hometown."
He does all the stuff.
"I like the message that she's for the people, which is the middle class, which I am middle class and the laws about women's rights."
"As you know, one strategist in Nevada joked to me, hey, it's not us that are delayed in counting ballots."
And not her.
And what I'm trying to do is use a platform that I have and urging the vice president to chart a new course on what's happening.
We win the whole.
"Look, this is still super close."
Lose four or five pounds.
"Once the lawsuits were mostly taken care of, Senate President Karen Fann put out another subpoena for these ballots and for the machinery and for everything else and for voter records."
"OK, there should be a two percentage point."
"I mean, it's crazy."
"That's the Democrats' calculus, but there's risk in that."
He pretended to be Scranton Joe.
Do you have a job that takes you outside of the state?
"Yeah, Lindsay, we know that he was arrested on the perimeter of the rally."
Used investigators from the Arizona attorney general's office to go sniff around and do the best to build up a report showing that Donald Trump actually won.
"During a rally in Flint, Harris highlighted her plans for what she called an opportunity economy and vowed to put middle-class working families first."
What kind of country we live in?
"So it's not like Quinnipiac is really the strongest pollster, especially in the Rust Belt."
What's it gonna be like in two or three years?
What's the mood there and what have you heard?
"But just down the road in Lidditz, a divided town shows changing minds won't be easy."
"Much of that, though, obviously targeted or is really being heard."
They barely lost the Senate race.
I had to sit on the side of the table.
I think that's actually the standard long term Justice Department position.
I think the House and the Senate are in play.
"Kamala Harris, till the time that she became the contender, was not seen as a vice president who performed so superbly well."
"But, you know, they're not trying to right now expand the party."
Both she and Donald Trump are so so focused on that state.
Betters are also putting their money on Harris flipping Trump on real clear.
"There's one big survey out Sunday, it's suggested Harris got no notable convention polling bounce, which I don't think is a complete surprise because, you know, once she shifted to the top of the ticket, there was this ground swell of enthusiasm, which, you know, one could say that would have been what happened after perhaps the DNC, instead she got it before."
That's how I want America to be.
Are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable?
Thanks to you.
No matter how many lawsuits or court cases when something is proven.
"Well, I think mathematically it's possible, but it's unlikely."
"I noticed this especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down, is a sign of strength."
And so you've got sheriff's officers that are positioned all around the building.
And that's when you start hearing about zombie voters.
And this is what all the political forecasts do is they'll have a model.

I don't think it's a cheap stunt.
And as President Kamala will never stop working to limit out-of-pocket costs and protect your care.
"And of course you don't hear them mention inflation at all, but this just goes to show you how much these people manipulate things."
Did God protect any of them?
"We're going to get in this more deeply ahead, but this is a good chance to set the table on this."
There have been many conversations when we first started with the Biden administration leading into with Harris Harris campaign individuals.
We want to remove this system that you have that is allowing you to process mail ballots so quickly.
"Only 76,000 votes."
"Dave McCormick, perhaps, appeals more to suburban voters."
Every one of those three examples of important rights we have to protect.
He knows about it.
"Kaitlyn, you've been paying attention to the former president's rhetoric on immigration."
It's so nuts.
" What is up YouTube is coffee back with another update and yes, it's another update about Trump What a crazy scene we got saw go down today in Pennsylvania And I was saying in another video not just what happened today how it felt so surreal and just like what the fuck You know everything from how it went down to his reaction just everything And then you take that along with other stuff that we've been seeing in the news as a latest just like man What in the world is going on in these crazy times?"
"Despite the fact that no evidence of widespread fraud has come to light in the 11 months since the election by anyone, anywhere, Republicans have only ratcheted up their ridiculous claims."
I'm Sean Mooney.
"And here you have the right-winger saying, well, you're just not right-wing, you're not Trump enough."

"I think we're going to all have to go back and say, that was a good job."
"You know, when you win, you don't really necessarily have to do it a second time."
These are Democrats from 30 years ago that in recent years have been trending Republican white working class blue collar voters.
"There are 50 states in the US but because most of them always vote for the same party, in reality there are just a handful where both candidates stand a chance of winning."
"And one of them, and this is where the vice president is going on her way right now, is Luzerne County."
"I said, why do you do that?"
"Joe Biden only won Wisconsin by less than a point, won Michigan by less than three points, and won Pennsylvania by a point."
I don't exactly understand these people's logic when it comes down to these primaries like we explained Pennsylvania very well.
"So you know, this is something that could be like a plus 9,000 margin."
So I don't know what she's going off on about.
Of course I am.
I'll come back to that.
"At this point, this is the worst position a Democrat has been in in the last eight years."
We're going to be spending a lot more time in Pennsylvania.
It really is.
"So we can no longer assumeâ€”I think during the first administration, they said, you know, take him seriously, but not literally."
"I love that if there's a young artist out there, an undecided voter who is an artist out there, what would you say to them in terms of who they should vote for if they're kind of like on the fence?"
"All private sector, big law, Yale Law School, all of these different things that J.D."
You're telling me that not a single person at The New York Times or Quinnipiac looked at this poll instead of themselves.
So it has made it ground zero For these two candidates and it's like they say that no matter who loses Pennsylvania that candidate has much less of a chance of prevailing nationally Wow In 2016 you wrote that quote Trump's dissing of democracy will live in infamy and that he was a clear and present Danger to our Democratic values What specifically did you observe about Trump eight years ago that led you to make his claim far before January 6th?
"Yes, because the economy is so, if we had a great economy, why would people have to get second and third jobs?"
"And Perry, it used to be that the opposing party would see the spotlight during the others' convention."

People went to jail for smoking weed.
"Another one of these, another one of these court, these legal challenges here, about 3600 names that there that the Republican Party is alleging these are people who moved out of state and should not have been able to vote."
What do you guys think about the situation?
We're standing strong.
"I mean, a very diverse county with Latino voters, Asian voters in Gwinnett."
"So if you are talking to friends and family and neighbors, and it's hard to have political conversations right now."

"I feel like it was hard for me, but I was brave enough to be without my mom."
She never called.
Two people ended up fainting.
People are ready to win and are ready to help deliver this ticket.
My favorite is the Trump iconic black mug.
We talked for over an hour and I came away very impressed.
So that's like a 10 point swing.
I think there's a lot of talk on the right about the left being very woke and you know I think it's definitely true for some people but a lot of us are just kind of trying to prioritize human rights and trying to make sure that we have respect for others and I think that a lot of what you see that seems very extreme on the left is not representative of all of us.
I said it's going to be a closed state regardless of what happens.
"You've got the tweets in all caps, the ranting and the raving about crazy conspiracy theories."
"Were you surprised that in a speech billed as being about the U.S. economy, Trump did veer off into so many other topics, even spending a lot of time talking about his former opponent, President Biden?"
They want an improved surrogate operation.
"Drew, thanks as always for joining us."
We are officially in the midterm election year.
I'm not that.
Where are we in 10 million as of a few weeks ago?
We won it twice.
And they're clearly outliers.
What do you want?
"What is your sort of feeling in terms of your family members or your friends and what's kind of going on also general comments on Like, you know the diaspora stuff."
It really didn't manifest.
I'm literally the only one.
We've still got the vice presidential debate.
I use the Heather colors.
Let's pause here for a second.
She's an acolyte of Donald Trump.
"There's no live audience, no opening statements, and candidates' mics will be muted when it's not their turn to speak."
"Asma, let's switch gears here."
"For Trump, Pennsylvania holds personal significance."
And some of them may be discouraged from getting the help they need.
"But if so, if that's the case, it's even worse because those are typically far more accurate than individual district polling."
It was a strategic move to energize voters in a state known for its political significance.
They were never going to win Florida.
And I'll tell you why that is because he's not being honest with himself every day.
They're going to help get him across the goal line.
And economic uncertainty.
"I'm happy because I think it's working out in our favor And I think Kamala is you know, she's not the most intelligent person."
Kamala Harris now has a 10 point advantage over Donald Trump in the swing state betting odds a week ago.
"That was the George W. Bush era, the Obama era, and then a little bit of the Trump era."
"The results from this poll suggest that Harris's campaign may be resonating well with voters, particularly among those prioritizing issues such as health care, labor rights, and economic equity."
"To quote the former president, during the conversation, he told me the election was rigged and that I won Arizona, unquote."
"And, uh, good luck to you."
Trump has also been ahead virtually all during the election season.
The influential Cook Political Report now rates Arizona a toss up in the presidential race.
"Now, a lot of these Republicans don't mind his economic policies, maybe not as protectionist view on trade, but they like low taxes."
"They appear to move someone or something out of the way and now this crowd, this rally crowd, is departing."
Is it close?
As to who I would vote for in this election I Strongly felt Kamala was more optimistic more respectful I thought she had plans that she Tried to describe in the minutes worth of time that she had I mean they really were limited with their time so I Don't know I just felt more strongly for her as opposed to her opponent I want to talk about some of the moments the debate because As we told you guys before the debate each of these individuals had a dial and if they turn the dial to the right Then they felt positive about what they were hearing in that moment if they turned it to the left They felt less so they felt negative about what they were hearing we could track that throughout the debate We're gonna show you a couple of moments where you saw the biggest movement Towards positive direction for both of those candidates You will see the lines at the bottom of the screen and you will see that movement as the sound we play you plays out We're gonna start with this Because they're radical the Democrats are radical in that and her vice presidential pick Which I think was a horrible pick by the way for our country because he is really out of it But her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine.
Harris did one today with a local Pennsylvania anchor.
"Here if you want even more detail, here's the whole website version of the wanted poster."
"And frankly, the fact that she has so strong support from the union movement, from folks in labor, tells you about her values, tells you about who she is as a candidate and why labor is going to be showing up for her in Pennsylvania come November."
What are your top issues?
What would a Harris point is?
"And it's unfortunate again, because it didn't have to happen because Donald Trump is in office."
"Now, one of the things that Harris campaign is learning is that in 2016, this was a complete blind spot for Hillary Clinton's campaign."
"The Phil's listen, they, they've had a, a little bit of a rough patch in the second half, but they get hot."
"Unlike the previous poll, this poll was conducted only between Trump and Harris."
Tammy Baldwin is also not up by 12 either.
But here's the deal.
It is good to be back in Arizona.
"Multiple sources close to the campaign tell NBC News that Harris's running mate will make their debut at a rally in Philadelphia tomorrow, and that the announcement most likely will come in a text that's sent to high-ranking Democrats, which is the same way they did it when President Biden picked Harris."
And a pandemic.
"And three, we've got Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's going to ride this till the cows come home."
That means there are a lot of American families who are not getting the things that they need.
So I know like personally we're not thrilled about the environmental impact of it but we know that the money is important to people.
It's too big to rig.
"And so as sort of a rebuttal to this town hall that former President Donald Trump is holding about a mile away from here at Univision with Latino voters, the Harris campaign held a press conference here to sort of stress their points and their message to Latinos."
And you can see a lot of these comments are just rough.
He's definitely gonna win big there again.
"So he's really going to have to drive home this issue, particularly on the economy, especially in the blue wall, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin."
There are some like CBS News that have not yet called or projected a winner there in that state.
Or however long.
So I think they're underestimating his support by probably two to 3% in this situation.
I'm obviously the whole lockdowns and everything like that.
"Now, tell us the moment because we see it on video there and I'm for people that weren't in the grocery store store."
But look at Harris voters.
"This is a massive, massive crowd."
"And McCormick ran one of the largest hedge funds in the world, investing in places like China and a lot of Saudi Arabia and all the rest of it."
That's all he's not talking about what his plans are.
But there's more to the story.
"But nevertheless, I will say that last night was a decent night for Trump, but down ballot Republicans, you know a lot of crossover voting and you see the establishment propping up certain candidates that are weaker."
"Harris must present a compelling economic vision that not only appeals to urban voters, but also resonates deeply with rural constituents who may be experiencing significant economic distress."
One who's a seasoned prosecutor who's going to make her case and one who is a felon.
He's got the core states that he held in 2020 plus North Carolina so far in his column.
You heard some of his opponents during the last few months say the wall wasn't finished.
"You know Western, Pennsylvania I'd love to hear what you think should be focused on I Think that's a very stark choice, and I think all of those things are embedded in that you know if you really if democracy is Important to you of course you know you know vice president Harris is going to be who you choice if you're talking about reproductive freedom for women of course obviously you're going to you're going to choose the vice president and if you're concerned about is somebody going to try to have an insurrection and and and Claim about you know rigged elections and things so definitely you're going to vote for for Harrison things But but that's why I can't understand why I personally would vote for that But I know a lot of people that are in an absolutely going to vote for Donald Trump and spend any time all across in small County, Pennsylvania You see a lot of support and there's a lot of energy there for Trump And I want people to understand that it's it's true And it's there and if we don't take it very seriously Then we do it our own peril on that the same message that I would have had Back the secretary Clinton, and I would like to remind the secretary Clinton She beat Trump in all three debates I was actually in the audience of that first debate and he absolutely Wooked him, but that really wasn't determinative in that race sadly Yeah, and so I want everybody to do on this I do believe that Harris is going to win and Trump is going to have a strong performance, too But I do not think it's going to change the underlying dynamic that I've already been discussing That it's since 2016 a senator John Federman."
Peace
"But the one place where you had somewhat okay turnout, I guess you would say, it's about where half the district was."
"But you've got to listen now when she explains to you why, as Erie goes, so goes the country."

"The third poll was conducted between September 26, 29 by the Trafalgar group among 1,090 likely voters."

"So the first is I met a woman when I was campaigning a few weeks back and she's a retiree and her husband is about to be a retiree, but he's still got a couple of years left in his working life."
"As a matter of fact, very little of the polling numbers."
Let me know what you think in the comments below.
"Neither is Walls, who's made it his signature issue as governor."
"But I really think there is going to be that quiet, sleeper, suburban woman vote."
So it just shows that these are different strategies.
We want our voters closed.
That's gonna happen.
"Trump's crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania yesterday or the day before yesterday, rather, was legitimately massive."
There are people who are sowing doubts in the political and the democratic process in this country.
"And I guess I don't think we'll know the answer until election night, really."
And it's a good feeling.
So keep that in mind.
And we were in constant communication with the National Archives to make sure that those weren't accepted.
"Now, Kelly Ward was reelected as the state party chair this weekend, narrowly, but the folks she beat were also pretty hardcore Donald Trump supporters."
"And by the way, that wasn't even the most surprising thing that came out of old Gasolini today."
He's at 49% to 45% for Harris among independents.

I just don't approve of her views on Israel.
"And basically the government, the prosecutors are shopping."
And I think that's the most damning part of J.D.
"That energy is something that's worth a little bit at the end here, and that's why, as I said before, I'd much rather be us than them."
But the same amount of time that we heard Vice President Harris talk.
It's crazy that that's an acceptable standard.
And so I think Democrats were pretty optimistic at that point.
They passed a free school meals program.
Everybody knows she's a Marxist equitable treatment Means we all end up at the same place The most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values do not change
The other president?

"We'll cover her flip-flop, why voters aren't buying it, and why this lie in particular is extremely important for voters in states like Pennsylvania and others."
I'm unclear what Oz really believes because he keeps changing his mind on a number of these issues.
"And we do see that from when she joined the race, she has improved significantly on the economy."
"And so Trump is performing not only better like with mail in votes than than than ever before, but he's also doing extraordinarily well with pro-life pro-gun Democrats, working class union Democrats."
And I think it's obviously just a larger problem with the way the media just expects the worst from him.
"And when you take a look at the numbers from the New York Times and Quinnipiac University and Franklin and Marshall, they all provide an individual lens that help us understand this race from multiple perspectives, from multiple different pollsters."
"Maine and New Hampshire, plus the 2nd congressional district in Maine and Nebraska."

Abortion is actually on the ballot right here.
Another factor to consider is the enthusiasm gap.

That hurts the industry.
"Millie, I lost respect for Millie."
"The COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted disparities in healthcare access, particularly in rural areas and among communities of color, which could play a role in how voters approach the upcoming election."

And this is a neck and neck race.
I didn't realize this.
Got to earn every vote.

"I'm sorry, there is some controversy over whether that's true."
What do you say to that kind of voter?
You know you can agree to gristigry both sides.
"Yeah, they don't and here's the reason they don't want Let's say you're a Democrat."
"Well, watch this."
But this is not what the polls the polls are saying right now.
"We just expanded things that were already in place with early voting, with curbside voting, secure ballot drop boxes to make it easier for so people didn't have to choose between their freedom to vote and their health and safety."

"A lot of times with voters, the emotional appeal tends to be a little more persuasive because that's where humans... we have emotions and we appeal to it."
But the thing about these places is they're also the kinds of voters where Donald Trump would hope to cut into some of those margins.
"For now, Shapiro says he's focused on electing Harris and serving as Pennsylvania's governor."
Same thing with voter registration.
No one knows.

"On the other hand, Oz lost."
"Ace again, the party most likely to lie."

We are going to win the whole ball game.
"You're supposed to have only red pens when you are around ballots, since ballot scanners can read black and blue ink."
"So but the real poll is going to be in three weeks, right?"
Most radical left person ever to run for office.
"I think there was a lot of good reporting around, you know, I think in like 2014 for salute."
It doesn't make them evil people.
It's for a lot of different people across the country.
"Chris Deluzio, we want to thank you."
There's a moment that a lot of people are talking about this morning where the former president just stood on stage for 30 minutes awkwardly while a greatest hits of his favorite songs played.

Cenk had a trip plan to Europe.
"We know, but I'm objective and it wouldn't be fair for me to cover the Pennsylvania polls without shedding some light on some Wisconsin news that might not be so good except, you know, we got to understand where this is coming from because you have a poll in Wisconsin."
So that's got him doubling down on... Trump?
And the good news is that you have a candidate.
"Kamala Harris is winning Wisconsin and Michigan, but by less than one point."
"The Secretary of State later clarified when it says canceled on that website, it doesn't mean your vote was canceled."

Stay tuned for more updates.
So like when they call- He's on the defense now.
The reason why they're chanting that is because Fox News called Arizona for Biden yesterday.
Pennsylvania has a very important influence in determining the next president of the United States.
"I mean, he touches on sexism, apathy."
"And moreover, that's not what any Republican or Democrat has done before President Trump."
It doesn't matter what Trump did.
"Today, we will analyze the latest polls in Pennsylvania."
This is Trump's hood.
"On the one hand, he said that Trump's populist appeal from 2016 has significantly decreased, while on the other hand, he credited Harris's success to her ability to resonate with a diverse variety of individuals, including moderate Republicans and independents."
And that's why these numbers are actually good news for us.
Clinton was up by six.

"They inquired about it, and it's at that point that the Trump campaign realized it had been hacked, or at least says it believes it had been hacked."
He's actually looking to potentially implement more.
What are some of his biggest policy accomplishments and where does he fall on some of the key voter issues?
"And now, eight years after he was elected, after all the arguments against Obamacare have been proven to be wrong, and even folks who don't like me sure like that insurance, when he was asked about it, he said, well, I have a concept of a plan for how I might replace it."
"And you know, no Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948."
"He's you know, retweeted things that were relatively pro-BLM and McCormick has done the same thing."

You just.
"In addition, he stressed the closeness of the race as well as the critical role that voter turnout will have in the outcome of the election."
There's a meaningful enthusiasm out there for her.

He expressed his disapproval of this decision.
Ms Harris announced a plan to give black men more economic opportunities and described some of her opponents' behaviour as increasingly unhinged.

The speech that I'm showing you took place on Friday evening.
It makes no sense.
Something really wild is going on there.
Harris 51 in Pennsylvania to Trump's 45.
And this is just a just a simple question.
"Um, and it was like updated in real time."
"I think they say, oh, it was only at 48 years."
I'm sure Biden was also there.
How do you then expand that messaging in order to attract more of those independent voters?
"Clearly, the rhetoric one of the candidates has is pretty ugly and cruel."
"You're warning us to sit it out and make sure we see where this ultimately lands, which which is, of course, I think a fair point as well, as we're following everyone's following quite closely."
David.
"Listen, nobody deserves to lose their life at all right now."
Will this early voting surge be enough for Harris to secure a win in Pennsylvania?
He was a veteran.
"The time Governor then I'll ask you, Charlie."
Let's listen in.
But Trump is not backing down.
Your thoughts on where the polling is at this stage of the election at this time?
But how does that impact the race?
I'm Jose Angel from Telemundo.
"So it's very, very important."
I don't know whether bosses would like that.
She says the conversations back home among her Philly suburban mom friends are crystal clear.
That is the laugh of a crazy person.
"No, but I would say it's clear as day that Trump is a favorite."
It has been nonstop attacks in that Senate race.
"They have absolute responsibilities, and their intention is to sow chaos, to put failure points in the system."
"Well, then the correlate corollary to that is then Trump is behind in other areas as well."
Did he pay his bills?
Kamala Harris is ready to do the job.
"It is very similar to the rest of the country, demographically, socioeconomically, and in its diversity."
So their average error was actually the lowest.
It was a neck and neck election.
"Yeah, so first of all thanks for having me, Joe."
That's why Pennsylvania is so crucial.
"My friends, it's good to be in the great state of Arizona."
"Yes, I am."
Our new ABC News Ipsos poll tonight showing the race in a dead heat nationally.
She says she wouldn't change anything.
"And by the way, I will give you one guess."
"Absolutely, of course."
We got a new Washington Post poll out this morning.
So what has changed?
"Now, for those that don't know, back in 2020, the state of Pennsylvania, at least the electorate, was roughly 27 percent Catholic and Trump won Catholics in Pennsylvania by around 11 points."
"But this is really, really huge that he's not going to be on the ballot in Pennsylvania, of course, because that would eat into the numbers for Kamala Harris."
He is stuck there.
"Now today in Arizona central reporter who volunteered to help the audit to gain access tweeted, quote, I noticed the counters had blue pens supposed to only have red when you're around ballots, since ballots can read black and blue ink."
"I said, up to that time, the circus, I called it the circus, had been brewing with lots of demonstrations, both at the counting center, at the Capitol, and other places."
They are undermining us as parents.
We'll keep it good.
So do you agree with that?
We have been talking for weeks about what Republican voters took away and what they thought of the damning evidence and the allegations laid out by those closest to Donald Trump through these public hearings from the January 6th select committee.
We don't know the answer to that question.
What do you think is happening in Wisconsin with Catholic voters if if Notre Dame shifted this Republican in just four years?
There's no guarantee of that anyways.
We should feel bad for him.
"That's kind of always the case, though, isn't it?"
It's such an important place and we relate and we are up in the polls fairly nicely.
" Meanwhile, Pennsylvania bakery is dipping into politics and voters are eating it right up."
"Yet every other pollster like Rasmussen, insider advantage, Trafalgar, Hill, Emerson, Emerson has the race type."
"But as you can see, Gotti's in the middle of kind of quite a crowd there."
"So the fact that somebody said even recently, like I guess Kamala changed her opinion about fracking."
Somewhere between two to three percent is where it's going to end up.
The candidates are gonna wanna be everywhere in Pennsylvania and Pennsylvanians are gonna wanna judge them and then go to the polls.
We'll throw them out the window.
"The boy's father has also spoken out, really asking Trump to stop."
"You're not going to anger and see supercharged turnout based on that issue alone, or you're not going to bleed a lot of independence on that issue alone as things stand today."
Come on Brian Trump Trump and finally Lindsay Still probably not voting don't you don't like either of them?
They should be at 65% of the total.
I'll tell y'all that look at all these people here.
It was incredible.
"Okay, that's true, but it's a bit misleading for a couple of reasons."
He was talking about her Time magazine cover.
"Now I'm on in Wilkes-Barrin, Scranton, Bedford and Philly in Pittsburgh."
So that is drifting away the traditional vote of both parties.
"Danielle Miller reporting for us live in Phoenix, Arizona as election 2020 continues to roll on there as President Trump supporters continuing to wait for more results in Arizona to see if they can indeed flip it back to read there and really change up the race there and the vote count electoral count that we are seeing right here at 264 to 214 right now in favor of Joe Biden."
"You buy a tank top or t-shirt, you can get a coffee mug, 20% off."
There was an instance where Kamala Harris showed up at a restaurant that was full of supporters and it turned out that they had cleared out the restaurant and bust in a bunch of supporters.
"Well, you know, the book on Kamala Harris was that she was a do-nothing vice president, that the White House itself didn't trust her, and that she was harsh."
"I mean, and epically so."
So you won't defend the re talk about that.
One of those she's considering.
They'll take a brilliant judge and they'll go after them.
"See 58-3, 56-7."
Right now I don't see much with Senator Casey.
One reason they are hopeful is that is how they've surpassed the GOP in the issue of enthusiasm.
We tend to have a lot of problems with Republicans on labor rights and how they don't really support workers.
Is Kamala's sudden tolerance for fracking believable or is it yet another line of bullshit she goes through just to win votes?
"You know, I'm heartbroken about it."
And I think they're the and it should be very easily handled by if necessary by national God or if really necessary by the military because they can't let that happen.
"This makes for an especially tense election atmosphere, as both parties are pulling out all the stops to mobilize their voter bases."
"Hell, they had Biden plus 13 just a month before the election."
Voter turnout will also be crucial in Pennsylvania.
"But before we do that, please be sure to like the video, subscribe to the channel, share with someone who's into politics, and let's get into the data here."
" Overview of polling data in key states, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada.as the political landscape heats up in the lead up to the upcoming elections, polling data from critical battleground states provides insight into voter preferences and potential outcomes."
"Traveling with him recently, Laura Loomer, a conspiracy theorist who last year insisted 9-11 was an inside job."
"But as we've learned throughout the entirety of the Trump era, it's very possible to be both dumb and dangerous at the same time."
"Nevada has trended nearly 5 points to the right since 2012, when Barack Obama carried it by 7 points over Mitt Romney."
Nineteen electoral votes in Pennsylvania.
So this was great in my humble opinion.
"Having these people, you know, basically start the conversation with Democrats like Kamala Harris will give a permission structure for a lot of these Republican voters out there to know that it is okay to like kind of like as a gateway to, it is okay to vote for Democrats and the policies that Democrats are espoused are not going to lead to the end of the world."
And he did not say yes.
Polls are showing a dead heat between Harris and Trump nationally.
"Literally in Arizona's election handbook, it warns about this specifically."
It's tough for him as popular or as unpopular as he is to get past that bar.
"And the poll that we see out of Rasmussen, the polls that we see nationally, they all confirm it."
And this is almost a point here that would go for Trump.
"So I think when we're looking at the aggregates, we do have to be able to look at the exact polls and look at these numbers and see what's going on in terms of what are they saying and what the margins are."
"And by the time we reached the election, she became someone with a positive approval rating."
"But when they asked me to have an official hearing, we establish it by protocols, public notice, et cetera."

"This is going to be a big debate to watch, because this is, you know, Florida."
"Hey Joe, give me the October surprise of all October surprise."
"Yeah, Republicans with new voters gained two thousand more new voters than Democrats did in the month of July."
We've got great designs.
These are poll workers.
So check this out.
They took it away.
It is neck and neck in Michigan.
"Well, listen, I think that the headline that I read about the rally in Pennsylvania yesterday was the big question and it's the one that Kamala Harris has not been able or willing to answer."
"Even if they released a Biden plus three poll, they wouldn't exactly, you know, bat an eye at it or they would be like, haha, this is proof."
I haven't had one in a long time.
And I refused.
 I'm being told at times that these are like right wing values.
And they still elected him you know in charge of this little area of the GOP.
Trump's record is a disaster.
Dig deeper.
How much to align with Biden versus how much to differentiate herself from him?
"Five point nine point average error, nearly six point average error off."
I'm not happy one way or the other it doesn't really affect me But I believe that they made the right decision and kicking it down in states Last thing I wanted to hit on if Kamala were to be elected.
But she wants just factual information.
"If a Harris-Shapiro campaign were to win in November, Shapiro would be the first Jewish vice president."
"Got, she's looking at the custom blings."
That is not compassionate to the American children that I have a responsibility to.
"For Philadelphia's young Republicans, they've also been knocking on doors, registering voters and hosting debate watch parties."
And that's where I'm at.
Donald Trump's campaign also shared aerial footage from Butler showing thousands of attendees.
"That was Governor Katie Hobbs, Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs who wasn't there for the Democratic nominee for president."

"And and so I don't think he takes it because it takes away his opportunity to not only finish out his first term and go into his second term, but also to prove himself to the people of the state."
What do you ask Vice President Harris?
Here's a picture of the guy shared by the Arizona House Democrats.
Harris leads this poll by one point.

This is not 2012 anymore.
They had Biden winning the state by 6.3% this day in history.
"When oil, when the price of energy goes up by 30%, 35%, 40%, that means a lot of our citizens who are choosing not to go on a vacation or choosing not to do something that they would otherwise do again because of bad leadership."

"You're in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state."
Thanks so much for watching.
But do you care more about the election now?

Trump is done.

I felt like it was her most genuine and passionate That I saw her pretty much throughout it I Didn't necessarily agree with what she was saying but my favorable reactions were because it was nice to see the passion and Believability that she stands behind and then have something to gauge More of what she says on since she hasn't spoken a lot solidly about a lot of issues And I think what's been interesting again following how you guys were tracking the debate which is a fascinating experience and I should know We nobody in this room has been listening to the postgame coverage.
"Understanding this context is critical for any candidate aiming to connect with voters across the spectrum, particularly in regions that have experienced economic hardships."
"Despite this, Harris has reasons to celebrate, as new polls show her leading Donald Trump in several swing states, suggesting a potential new electoral path through the Sun Belt states."

I guess.
"First of all, obviously everything is very expensive, and I want to be able to at least buy a house in the future and have a future and have family and everything, and just with Donald Trump and then obviously all the immigration and everything."
I want to play that sound and get your reaction.
What's another one to watch?
"Down in Florida, another electoral giant here with 30 electoral votes, it was one of just five states where Trump managed to improve on his 2016 margin, as he carried it by 3.4% in 2020."
We're seeing that that's exactly what happened in Pennsylvania.
Huh.

No offense to them.
And the article kind of hints that this might not just be a Philly thing.
"The seventh poll was conducted between September 12th and 16 by the Washington Post among 1,003 likely voters."

"Well, I mean, that's what people were saying."
"Obviously, as we remember going back into the last debate, it was President Biden who had that worry on his mind."
I know I don't think it was since 2016 that Republicans haven't won here in Pennsylvania a key swing state What do they have to do differently this time around to win?
"I'm no expert, but check me on all those and let me know if I'm right or wrong."
"Our job is to make sure we are constantly just providing the truth to voters to be a For Secretary Schmidt, getting out the message can mean late nights answering questions about the electoral process in granular detail."

Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote and Donald Trump 46%.
"I mean, that's what all these have been up to this point."
Donald Trump is winning Pennsylvania.
And I looked up the next day.
"Pennsylvania, with its 19 electoral college votes, is seen as pivotal, with both campaigns targeting different voter demographics."
That's always going to happen.
"Really appreciate your down the middle approach, calling balls and strikes on both sides."
"And then Donald Trump's like, all right, let's play the song."
"He won in 2016, narrowly lost in 2020."
"And yet when Donald Trump lies or cheats or bullies or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls service members like John McCain losers because they died in battle or were captured, when he calls fellow citizens Burman or the enemy within, people make excuses for it."

"The issues that resonate with Pennsylvanians, such as the economy, healthcare, and education, are often reflective of the concerns of Americans across the country."
Half century.

"But apparently there's yet another option being pursued as an ongoing matter by the cops at the National Archives, by the investigators at the National Archives, involving one of the two sets of forged documents sent in to the National Archives by Arizona Republicans pretending to be electors when in fact they were not."

"We tie this all together, right?"
So it says court stops Pennsylvania counties from throwing out mail-in votes over incorrect envelope dates.
So what we know we know she was like grew up in Alabama.

He won every county in Michigan.
I think we need to have higher standards for our candidates.
Jeff Harris is expected to hold two rallies in the state today.
And that's why they're going to vote for him.
Josh Shapiro is very talented.
All these different answers that may have been Biden voters from 2020 that are now coming back home with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket.
Same thing with Georgia because you have Trump versus Biden.
"Fortunately, federal investigators are now looking into it."
"And there were significant numbers of people in both Wisconsin and Michigan, who are both important battleground states that did choose to vote sort of uncommitted."
Looking at.
"I know if you, if you listened, David Plouffe did an interview with my old colleague at the circus, John Heilman, and he says that their data shows basically 4% of the electorate is undecided."
"I know Eric Messersmith and his buddy, Brian Johnson, we put that video on the channel and they were citing the polling numbers."
"So Kamala Harris is countering with okay, you're gonna send these people away Well, I'm gonna put them in my tent I'm gonna open up my tent and give them room and it'll be an interesting strategy in terms of seeing if it ends up working Out I do think this time around I think there will be like I'm not saying it's gonna be an extreme amount It's gonna be small but there may be some moderate Republican vote that ends up voting for Kamala Harris I think in 2016 is really non-existent in 2020."
They're off by three points.
"You're gonna hear a lot about Pennsylvania between now and Election Day, especially Allentown, located in Lehigh County, home of the Liberty Bell Museum, and if you're hungry, scrapple and cheese steaks."
You don't hear that every day.
And not.
I'm not a black voter though.
"As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm Dark MAGA."
Pennsylvania really is kind of the ball game.
That's them auditing the vote.
"Thank you, Patrick."
Trump low prices.
"Thank you, Pittsburgh."
"His honesty, his bravery."
Welcome to all of you.
"Maybe they're persuadable Whereas most of the people who read mainstream Print media in particular, you know, they they already know politics really well They've made up their minds a long time ago So that she's decided to waste of time to to go to them because you've got all these other outlets And lastly, what advice you have for students ahead of this upcoming election?"
"Well, thanks for having me."
And now Kamala Harris is losing on the nuclear politics average by just 0.2% nationwide.
Why aren't there eight genders?
"And listen, if there's one thing that I've learned since being governor is that leadership has consequences, that it matters who's in charge, and it impacts every single family, every single business in the state when you have the right person in the White House and the wrong person in the White House."
"That was in 2022, winning by an eye-catching 14 points."
But Harris is directly tethered to those policies.
11 members of the far right anti-government extremist group the Oath Keepers have been charged with seditious conspiracy.
That's a friend of mine.
"That's what we normally do during the monologue, yeah."
He actually said it might be less than that because some people can't sink a two-foot putt like Biden.
"And the fact of the matter is 157,000 Republicans on the primary election, even after Nikki Haley had withdrawn, voted for her."
"Two, three, four."
"They hold up a mirror to everything happening in society, all those demographic changes, the economic anxieties, what we hope for, what we're afraid of."
He's confused.
Everybody in that building's life was threatened.
So a lot to get to just two weeks to go.
Do you think that somebody planned it?
I'm just saying so if you're on the highways Chuck is here.
"If she gets 43 percent or higher in the Northeast part of the state, game over."
Pennsylvania's cannot trust Kamala Harris or Bob Casey on the most critical industry for their future.
The election could come down to the wire.

"She believes that by strengthening the economy, she can win over undecided voters who are concerned about their financial future."
"That's pretty much all the Democrats when they're in control of states, they try and make the voting laws extremely lax."
That's love.
You have one out of Emerson.
None of it affected him.
"We have a history of a number of things, including redlining."
Harris' remarks concur with the White House's months-long opposition to the company's planned sale to Nippon Steel of Japan.
"And although she is currently the Vice President of the United States of America, but as we know, the Vice President's role is not to overshadow the President."
And yet that may not be enough.
We lost a great person.
He also is a Republican official decrying the conspiracies around the 2020 election result.
"In Pennsylvania, Trump winning by 30 plus points."
Meanwhile Mr. Trump is campaigning in Arizona.
So getting anything done related to election reform has certainly been a challenge.
They're sucking up to their base to try to give them the things that they want.
I see the same thing in Georgia.
"I have to say, I'm looking at these cookies."
There is no mountain we cannot climb.
For all agents.
"Although less of an outlier, Muhlenberg College not only had a long time between its polls but also switched sample types from registered to likely voters which may account for the change that they saw."
What's your reaction to that in Donald Trump's statements in general saying that the Medal of Freedom is better than the Medal of Honor?
"It's wild to me that we are talking about, I actually asked my staff to check this fact about the fact that they're going to have snipers and three layers of fencing and FBI agents because it's incredible to me that we're saying that these words are coming out of my mouth."
"They're off by three points, which is very possible, considering you have garbage pollsters like Bloomberg finding Harris plus five."
"But nice seeing you, everybody."
"Well, but he lost in an election."
"And of course, they're going to get demonized by the election mafia because they don't fit the narrative."
"The diversity of this state is a major factor, making it the focal point of election campaigns."
You saw Senator Bernie Sanders saying that he was for Tim Walz of Minnesota.
"Only once in the past four presidential elections, Donald Trump's victory in 2016, did fewer than 90 percent of Pennsylvania's black voters support the Democratic nominee."
Is anyone there?
"I'm also announcing that as part of our additional tax cuts, we will end all taxes on overtime."
So there has been some good data.
And not just any votes.
And it was interesting to see because Centre County has been a tightly contested race the last two presidential elections.
Will you support that?
But I think what you're finding is the coalition that was built by Joe Biden to defeat Donald Trump four years ago is not tightly knit together.
Did you genuinely think that attaching a message in cursive meant it was somehow secure?
"And that actually ties into another major concern the article raises, which is outreach to voters of color."
"So even then, he doesn't even need a state like Nevada, Arizona."
"That's far fewer than the 10,000 plus vote margin by which President Joe Biden narrowly beat Donald Trump in the state."
Somebody has a lead.
"And so again, this was a poll that was conducted around the time that the selection process was happening."
"For Democrats, maintaining their coalition of urban voters and winning back suburban voters who swung Republican in 2016 is essential."
"And it looks like again, a 50-50 some game."
I'll do it here.
"But let's take you to the aforementioned Bucks County and welcome back to News Nation correspondent, Caitlin Becker, who's been going around talking to voters there."
Joining us now is New York pollster and founder of John Zogby Strategies.
"Here, play this clip."
We need to see her with voters because it is just energy fuel.
"Yeah, and what are some of the big issues for voters in Pennsylvania right now?"
"Chereeka, it's a great question."
Bring them in now.
I'm actually really hoping my college starts to offer bachelor degrees so I can graduate without debt.
"I was at the Golden Gate Bridge today and I was taking the stroll, talking to average Americans, the American voters."
And you also have from Democrats a legitimate concern that anything they don't get done this year and relatively early this year is going to get completely overtaken by election year politics.
"Also checking in with another previous pollster, previously the NYTCN College likely voter polling in early August had Harris improving substantially over Biden with a race standing at 46-50 in her favor."
Every poll in the RCP average has shifted at least three points towards Trump.
"But it's a historical moment that matters in rallying people, boosting morale and telling people you need to get out, you need to vote."
"And if you look at, let's just look at Michigan, for example."
"And there's some very important races coming up, basically, at this point, next year in 2022."
"I can understand, you know, oh, maybe it's a tight race in Pennsylvania and then Trump's tied in the popular vote."
In fact one woman I visited with told me that when her backyard floods she can hear sewage flowing underneath her floorboards and as a result too many communities across the south we've seen a rise in infections like hookworm which are basically people nodding tiny parasites that burrow into the skin and cause fever and nausea and abdominal pain so this is a serious issue it is a serious issue with serious health implications not to mention just basic points about what we need to do to address inequities.
"It's like Trump plus two in Wisconsin, Trump plus three in Pennsylvania, which I'm not saying it's a guarantee."
"And then on election night, you'd be counting the ballots as they're coming in."
Mostly they deal in women.
There's 13 million people in the state.
She just basically repeated everything that Biden has said in the past.
Harris has less than a single percentage point lead there.
We're a great nation.
I know we need him.
But what is this?
You cranked him out in 2009?
And did he comment at all about potentially who Harris's vice president would be given that he was in Pennsylvania?
"Kalshi bettors say it will go below $45,000 by the end of August."
"We understand that, but based off of the polls and based off of these numbers, it looks like they're just throwing random things up."
Critical state.
Ryan made waves and headlines on July 2nd.
I just heard one.
"And if he's running, I will."
"Tax Network USA, a nationwide tax firm, has helped taxpayers save more than $1 billion in tax debt."
"This being the result in Wisconsin actually is not really all that bad, all things considered."
"At that point, for Harris, she just has to win Wisconsin and Michigan, which if she is in fact winning Pennsylvania, there's a good chance of that happening because the three states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, they vote together."
You really do got to hope for what's best.
And Donald Trump knew the dangers and standing up was to send a message to the world.
We'll say 86 percent in Pennsylvania.
I partied.
That would make sense.
"But look at this, Tammy, Democrats in panic nationally."
"I think she won that comfortably, but it didn't seem to be reflected in some of the focus groups that came out after."
Let's see.
"Representative Summer Lee, Representative Chris Deluzio, I want to thank you."
Thanks for tuning in and stay informed as we continue to cover this historic election.
We're going to bring you together around the Steelers game.
"If he's really winning Pennsylvania by two to three points, which, by the way, he's up in Arizona, Georgia, but we'll just say he doesn't win either of those states."
Great breakdown.
She was the one reporter in there.
They came here to support him because they know what will happen if Trump does not become president.
"But if you watch 60 Minutes, that's how all of their interviews are."
It's the two of the states that Biden turned around.
"Having said that, I think people remember that prior to the pandemic, we had the best economy in my adult lifetime and very recently we had a really rough patch."
Just like a lot of these pollsters from the mainstream media.
"And if you could give advice to anybody who's thinking about taking their son to insurrection at the Capitol, what would it be?"
I do hope we'll talk again.
This is post-conviction.
"We welcomed Governor Waltz, the area a little while ago."
I should just say that what we should really be focusing on here are the averages.
"So yes, expect a lot of time spent here over the next 50 days."
 Anybody who's about beating down other people is a coward!
"I'm not exactly sure how he stacks up as a candidate now, compared to then he was much stronger in 2020 than he was in 2016."
I know she's been talking to folks to and from on the flights.
Trump is at 52 percent.
Donald Trump spoke at a town hall event in Oaks where he promised to increase oil drilling to drive down energy costs.
"But again, my point is there is asymmetry in how objective and how much journalistic integrity these two places have."
"I'm Claude McDaniel, and tonight, we bring you breaking news from the campaign trail."
Democrats saying this is just former President Trump speaking on the topic of the hour.
I think she's doing what she needs to do.
We are going to record for one of the best elections for a super-clap.
This is a man who does not tolerate profanity or inappropriate language of any kind.
I got to show you this.
"We don't know 18 year old Jamel Garcia, a student at the Brothers Barber shop, says he'll vote for the first time."
People want an inspirational reason to come out to the ballot come November.
Not just one of them.
I'm not going to bore you with the details of what that means and how we get it.
Ruben.
So this is a real weakness from Trump.
No one should lose their vote over a simple human error.
"In Tampa, they had 100 mile gusts of wind."
That is a great blessing and a good thing.
That's his idea of freedom.
"I mean, they give us some data points, some early indicators."
"So we can see here with these poll numbers here in Pennsylvania, you know, it says who's ahead in Pennsylvania and you have this 1.2 margin."
I would say that who Donald Trump character is does not align with the type of person that I want to be as a disciple of Jesus Christ.
"Today, she held a rally in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a little bit north of Philadelphia, where she highlighted Republicans now supporting her and also sat down for an interview with Fox News."
"And then another replied, ""'We don't have any khakis."
"I try and think about the job I have to do right before me, and that is to be the best governor I can be and politically to focus on helping Kamala Harris and Tim Valls be elected president and vice president."
"With respect to the other economic policies, I think folks in Pennsylvania are really just beginning to get to know what some of those policies are."
"I think generally, the polls are going to be relatively accurate, but when they're this close, I mean, one percentage point can completely change the outcome."
How are you supposed to win Pennsylvania?
"This meeting was the same day, I believe, that the governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, certified Biden as the winner of the presidential election in Arizona."
"South Carolina knows how to pick presidents and a lot of these states that are thrust into the middle of it, whether in a primary or now here in Pennsylvania in a general election, I think voters are discerning and they're thoughtful about the decisions that they make."
"Trump won in two polls, but Harris gained a slight edge in four polls."
She's talked to people from Pennsylvania.
We want safety and security for our country.
"And it's a charge now leveled against 11 members of the far-right Oathkeepers group, including the group's leader, for their alleged roles in the insurrection."
Like what?
"So I find it very interesting that the Biden campaign, they're launching this six figure ad by, you know, where they highlight Trump essentially slamming Haley over and over again."
Dronald Drumpf and all the sort of stuff that you saw in 2016.
"And even the Trump team is convinced that if she picked Josh Shapiro, that would take Pennsylvania off the table."
It is the Lehigh Valley or Northeastern Pennsylvania.
"We're not know we're not crazy about Harris as the vice president Well, she wasn't impressive."
"Obviously, as you know, the race in Pennsylvania raised her thin."
I think that we're in a better place than we were in 2020.
"Now the other interesting point with that 3.4 million number is that a lot of people have said wow this this race is really narrowed if you look at it you know Vice President a former Vice President Joe Biden had a really widely and it's now narrowed to about 68,000 votes but in this state you only need one tenth of one percent to have a recount so it's very very narrow so with 3.4 million votes that calculates out if I'm doing my math correctly to about 3400 votes would have to be between the two candidates before a recount would have what would happen here so that's what people are watching if that narrows even further but the one thing about Maricopa County that's also changed is that well this has been a reliably Republican area the demographics here have changed so you've had a lot of younger people move in from more liberal states like California they came out to vote you had more suburban women show up at the polls who voted for former Vice President Joe Biden and then you had the Latino population which has increased here tremendously just between 2018 and 2020 a hundred thousand Latinos had reached voting age so it's been a big shift in that demographic and many people think that the majority of the votes will go to former President former Vice President Joe Biden but we'll have to see so there's enough there's enough there to keep an eye out and people are anxious to get the results in so hopefully we'll have those by the end of the day today"
So that's crazy.
And that is something that is viable.
And I will always have the fact of America's steel workers.
Or criminal referral rather to the U.S. Attorney General William Barr.
"And you look at everything that's happened over the last 20 years in this country, war in Afghanistan, war in Iraq."
"If you do, make sure to like this video and subscribe to Global News Network for more content like this."
Also rejected the idea saying it's not sensical and it would have to be part of other solutions.
The Democrats were less organized here.
But his fans loved it.
It's just crazy.
"In my opinion, I think the Trump campaign, they should talk more about this."
"They didn't require new leases, number one."
We're going to actually look at voter registration numbers and previous election results numbers and show how likely it is for the Democrats to win in Pennsylvania.
"It'll probably be Harris plus two or plus three if that, and when the Rasmussen poll gets put in, you're going to see Trump probably have like a one to a 1.2 point lead in Pennsylvania as he expands his lead."
"Because look, when you are running against somebody who should be a historically unpopular opponent, you do have to use that against him."
"You know, we oftentimes hear pundits or even campaigns talking about suburban women."
This is the same man who said he was going to eliminate abortion and pack the Supreme Court to steal a woman's right to choose.
Right now we just saw a shift change between some of the governor's detail as we are working to find out when the governor will return here at home.
Ongoing work.

"You're questioning his stamina, his mental acuity."
"Look, there's been good economic data recently, right?"
The Harris team is now saying that they want the microphones on all of the time because they think it makes Donald Trump look bad.
They did everything they could.
"Again, picket someone as a VP."
"Starwalt's observations highlight the importance of understanding the concerns of rural voters, many of whom may feel disconnected from the Democratic Party's mainstream narratives."
"He worked construction, worked as a meat packer, anything to help his family."
I wonder if the Trump campaign has responded to the vice president's use of his own words at her rallies to rally voters to her cause.
"Walz and Harris head to Michigan and Wisconsin and I'm told that it is in the Midwest where Walz is from, that the campaign believes he can be the most helpful, especially since the Republican vice presidential nominee is from the Midwest as well."
"Republicans gained 22,000 voters Democrats gained not even 10,000."
How is the Harris campaign kind of working to close the gap on some of these key issues?
We got to make sure that he can get as many votes as possible out of the state of Pennsylvania.
We ate her.
"This story was published before the rally that I played the clip from earlier took place, so if Bartolotta did get to meet with Trump before he gave that speech, she must not have been very convincing."
Because of his statements and his conduct.
"Like I heard David McCormick over the weekend saying that Democrats, they're they're coming for your stakes."
Some are just built different.
My name is Kimberly Clark-Baskin and I am the City Clerk for the City Council of the City of Pittsburgh and I am also a proud resident of the Homewood community.
Whatever happened to killing spies?
"And even if you want to compare like the polls today to the polls back then in a lot of these 2022 races, they were, you know, more accurate than the final aggregates were."
"But so it says a Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, posted on social media that the ruling was quote, a victory for Pennsylvania's fundamental right to vote."
It's nerve-wracking.
You know that.
"We could do that with Kamala Harris after a 20-minute event, because she does word salads, and she couldn't hold court like that without a teleprompter."
"I've never been more optimistic, and I mean it sincerely."
"So we just released Coming Home, which is a song about how our cities are falling apart."
"For example, she's also unveiling policies that providing a million loans for black entrepreneurs, national health initiative that is intended to focus on diseases that particularly impact black people."
He's now senior advisor at a group called Our Republican Legacy.
They got a lie in it.
"What I would say about the economy is it affects me personally, but it also affects every age group and every demographic of people in this country."
So let's talk about the economy.
He let me down.
"And now they're arguing that, that Donald Trump, I guess kept everything closed and had the unemployment."
"Many people in Washington, DC, and concerned election observers around the country, Republican and Democrat, think that the only way that you can combat the kind of laws that we're seeing in Arizona and Texas and Georgia would be to reform the filibuster and pass the For the People Act."
That's the best compliment that we can get.
"He won't tell us who's going out to knock on doors to ask people, hey, did you really vote on whether they've been vetted, who's going to be asked what they're going to be asked."
"And I have been flooded with texts from people saying, oh, wait a minute."

"And the population of those counties are so big that even if, say, a Republican doesn't carry a Bucks County, if he does considerably better than a Republican typically does, that can be enough to win the state, too."
"You've got Democrats, business leaders, military leaders, former Republicans were able to fill rooms even if Kamala Harris is not there in Pennsylvania to let people know what is at stake and why they should rally around Kamala Harris."
We are doing a special for a limited time.
That would be the equivalent.
"That right, it's like, yeah."
So I think you'd see a second Trump term without as much chaos and without as much groping for what America first policy really means.
"Scott, what you're describing is horrific."
She's my jackpot.
There will be more connection to the Board of Supervisors.
"Oh, listen, I'm telling you, Pennsylvania, and I want to be clear for people who are listening, it is never been more favorable for Republicans."
"But if he's up by two to three points as of now, which by the way, this should be Harris's best polling right now, especially in August."
They were I I shouldn't even say that they just vanished.
That's the sad reality.
So you heard so you heard his words.
"Is it just about canvassing, knocking on people's doors and saying, hey, are you registered to vote?"
It certainly went down to 99 and I started freaking out already.
"Harris voters, more likely than Trump voters to say that the U.S. stock market is higher now."
It's a dedication to all the ideals of what America stands for.
"He is in Wilkes-Barre today and then York, Pennsylvania on Monday at the start of the DNC in Chicago."
She's only tough on guys like me because they want to go after their political opponents.
Be sure to watch through to the end to see the huge amount the last person on the list donated.
Who do you think won by show of hands former president Trump?

So much has happened.
And he was laying down on a roof that wasn't even that far from the venue.
"It's the same like climate change, gun control, reproductive rights."
"But when Trump says, I'm going to come back to the place where I took a bullet, nearly died, that is a powerful statement."
Pennsylvania isn't just any state.
This might be a what the hell?

The historic coalition might prove to be a powerful voting and mobilization bloc.
"They're in the eastern third of the state, the Delaware River Valley."
"And by the way, I'm sorry, gentlemen."

You could find me mostly on Instagram at tatju77.
Now leading Trump 53% to 43%.
"And while in Pittsburgh, President Biden, he made a speech at the United Steelworkers headquarters, this on the heels of the announced acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan-based Nippon Steel."

The variation in polling data across different areas reflects the state's diverse political landscape.
"This election cycle, you know, when I was waiting to give my speech at the DNC, they had us in like whatever the green room or the back room or whatever you want to call it."
So maybe we'll make a Maha skateboard.
Go see pig.
This legal victory comes at a time when election integrity is a hotly debated topic.
But here's the thing to remember.
That the whole election could be decided here.
Rusty Bowers became a national figure because he testified about the pressure campaign that Trump allies placed on him to overturn the election.
The early vote metrics for black women are up 250% from 2022.
Based shit.

The administration is a new generation.
I was in Butler on the day of the assassination attempt.
"If that really does happen, it's Harris not going to win Pennsylvania."
"Quinnipiac University had her up three points, a reduction of one point, but still largely in line with the average there in favor of Kamala Harris."

"It just feels very positive, which is I mean just obviously completely the opposite of Trump's campaign, just in general."
"And I think it's a really, you know, whether it's Kamala Harris putting pressure on big tech companies to censor her fellow citizens, whether it's calling people racist for daring to believe that we ought to have an, we ought to actually have border security in the United States of America."
It's a clear drop off with Democrats Democrats are voting by mail a lot less at least requesting their ballots at a far slower pace than 2020.
Honestly because Donald Trump told me to.
He couldn't answer that question.
And even then you look at some of these places really comes down to can Trump reverse some of the home region effect of Biden?
Trump most likely will be able to win both of these states by 10 percentage points or more.
He's likely set to gain some.
Do you travel as a country?
"Counties such as Erie and Luzerne have demonstrated a tendency to flip between supporting Democratic and Republican candidates, driven largely by local economic conditions, cultural identity, and the overarching sentiment of their constituents."
"And I got, well, I got you here."
"I mean, first of all, wasn't Trump supposed to be reinstated by August or something?"
We look forward to hearing more with you at five.

"And it's interesting, Akayla, in our NBC News poll, voters were asked, what is the one issue you feel so strongly about that you will vote for or against a candidate solely on that issue?"
Still a little bit favorable to Republicans generally speaking.
"Listen Getting out we would have been out faster than that, but we wouldn't have lost the soldiers We wouldn't have left many Americans behind and we wouldn't have left we wouldn't have left 85 billion dollars worth of brand-new beautiful military equipment behind and just to finish They blew it The agreement said you have to do this this this this this and they didn't do it They didn't do it."
"Vice President Kamala Harris rallying a room full of around 7,000 supporters."

I'm going to bring that back entirely.
And that's what he's doing here.
"But again, so far, we've tried to just keep a low profile because we don't want to antagonize the situation."
"In our Commonwealth, Kamala Harris just seems to keep doing exactly what she's doing, which is showing up in communities that are oftentimes ignored and left behind forgotten areas that you know, in the past had maybe been flyover areas for national candidates."
"Yeah, it shows a shift on it from our last poll in September."
"Well, that's her right."
Do we know if this accusation is correct?
Secret service can do it.
"Today, we spoke with voters who are mostly in favor of a Harris-Shapiro ticket, while others just want the governor to finish out leading the Commonwealth."
"And we've also seen Donald Trump be indicted on various federal crimes, not limited to sexually assaulting, being found liable for sexually assaulting E. Jean Carroll in a New York City dressing room in 1994."
That's the problem.
They're both in good shape.
Who submitted that to him?
I don't love election season.
This would be a disaster for manufacturing in Pennsylvania.
This development comes amid growing criticism of both Governor Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris for their limited engagement with the press since Harris's presidential campaign launched in July.
But what's his name?
Their streets are unsafe.
"I mean, whoever that is talking, you already know it's just somebody that didn't like Trump already."
"Like Dolores Cole, we met her at that Republican event."
Do you see the problem?
That just made my heart swell.
"The point is, I was just picturing it, The point is, if you elect Kamala and Tim, they will not be focused on their problems, they will be focused on yours."
It's only one metric.
It's clear that Pennsylvania is a key state for both candidates and they are pulling out all the stops.
I'm Nicole Breli live at our News Nation headquarters in Chicago.
"Yes, they are perfecto perfecto."
"Now, of course, different things that can mean different things to different people, but Gallego at 60, reasonable, and Lake at almost 60 as extreme."
So it's not just ancestral Democrats.
Her campaign is based upon lies about President Trump.
"There's four big fella suburbs, your home territory."
The Trump mugshot design.
"Their support, driven by a range of interests from health care and education to economic equity and environmental protection, reflects the diverse coalition Harris has built as she seeks the presidency."
So extremely close.
"Secretary of State Hobbs, we heard testimony from Arizona's Republican House speaker, Rusty Bowers."
I think we need him in Pennsylvania.
"I think if you're in public service and you don't have purpose in the work you do, if you can't affect change directly, you know, we live by three letters in my administration, GSD, get stuff done."
"Secretary Benson, um, tragically your state, um, also flirting with the idea of audits."
So and they always under sample Trump too.
He's voted for a series of things that have made our Commonwealth much worse.
"So I guess my question is, how much weight should we really give these early polls?"
Just go to OANN.com to easily sign up for OAN Live and stay informed.
Off by 12.
They didn't provide different mechanisms.
But I digress now what's this year?
"If it wasn't for that, it would be Biden plus four, plus five, plus six, or some crazy number like that."
That is tough.
"You know, we all know that across the board tariffs are a tax on everybody."
But you could see coefficient is here.
"He said, well, we have heard by an official high-up in the Republican legislature that there is a legal theory or a legal ability in Arizona that you can remove the, the electors of President Biden and replace them."
"The Trump hat, but here's the full video, uh, and the full context."
"They were a united front, committed to fighting for the working class and ensuring a better future."
The vice president and her new running mate lavishing praise on one another last night as support porters screamed in favor of the pick.
"So that shows people if you're going to get to a cotchow conniption, that would be quite a development."
"You know, the media was very busy for 20 years looking for jihadists under every bed."
"You know, people will say, well, there isn't enough to overturn this particular election."
"I mean, it was pretty amazing for me at the roll call just to look around state by state and see all colors and creeds and backgrounds."
"And as you could see from the Dominion voting machines lawsuit, the sort of patience some people have for this kind of behavior is worn really thin."
"So for Trump right now, and then obviously you look at all the betting and everything like that and in the Atlas Intel poll, and now we're really talking about the popular vote being a potential Trump victory as well to the point where I might have to predict a Trump popular vote victory."
And they're targeting Republican voting districts.
"We need these, we need to come out and wreck our numbers."
Now here in 2024 we saw Trump make gains against Biden in the crosstabs among voters of color before the president dropped out.
The gap has narrowed.
"Not only there too, but on the national level."
I'm going to break you of this habit.
Democrats just seem to be running in place.
They were saying he he's he's a retard.
"Sure that one came in first, but a few days later, when a second set of fake elector documents came in from Arizona and from a bunch of other states, why wasn't a federal investigation launched into those as well?"
"And obviously your taxes and the HOA fees, if you're talking about a condo, those have gone through the roof as well because it's so hard to get insurance for these condo associations as well."
I'll tell you what.
"But in Michigan, it is the EV mandate, the electric vehicle mandate that is a job destroyer for auto workers."
"It's why I've continued to stand up for the process that we oversaw in 2020, which was free and fair, and the results we certified are accurate, and why I'm going to continue to fight to ensure access for every eligible Arizona voter."
I'm not sure that Harris has that kind of instincts or experience to know where that is.
"Because the Democrats were scared of COVID, didn't want to go to the polls."
But Shapiro on the ticket could still lock things up for those 19 electoral college votes here in Pennsylvania because he's extremely well like sixty one percent approval rating.
"You know, just a few hours ago on Thursday, the Biden Harris administration announced another round of student loan forgiveness, bringing the total amount of student loan cancellation to more than $175 billion."
Because we think about Gwinnett.
Many of them don't want to vote Trump for whatever the reason may be.
She's lightning in a bottle.
"Would everyone else, even the Washington Post or even Franklin and Marshall, they're finding the race, you know, within the margin of error."
"Because they can't pull up and the Amish love mail in voting because you know, a lot of them don't want to go stand in line and the polls and some of them don't mind."
He is an outstanding U.S.
I just felt her Passion response and that she would carry it out and that resonated with you in the moment.
"But one Berks County College professor says, forget all of that."
"But more than that, actually, if this got into the wrong hands, it would provide information on sensitive law enforcement activities, law enforcement personnel that could put these operations at risk."
"Next, Donald Trump talks about the federal criminal cases where he's a criminal defendant."
They do this crap every single year.
"And if it is about the issues, then Republicans can win."
I fought to protect this country and keep it from socialism and Trump's values align with my values in that regard.
We're going with that.
"And of course, Quinnipiac is Quinnipiac."
That's so important.
"Again, I put this in a video, went out last night."
"Quinnipiac, The New York Times, Suffolk, Franklin and Marshall."
"White non college student, I think white non college student will increase to point three."
A lot of people don't like to wear masks.
"But it's a very, very important state."
He's down by two weeks down by one.
No word on any training they may or may not have received to handle all of the actual ballots cast in the presidential election.
And there are one hundred and thirty two thousand votes down as of today.
"But Dr. Oz has been that guy in Trump's circle, extended circle for a while."
And this poll sheds light on the complexities of this key voting bloc.
"Cause you know, you need rules, you know, ungrateful black women been propping you up and do just do what we tell you."
"And then another thing the campus is doing that's pissing me off is she's trying to, she's trying to be everything to everybody."
There are a lot of issues with this election that took place.
"50 staffers and sorry, no, we're working hard to go a bunch of people here not looking good."
No Trump presence or endorsement.
"Now, does this mean Trump's going to win Pennsylvania by 10 points?"
Trafalgar is to the left of Quinnipiac of all polls.
Do you think they're going to vote for Kamala Harris?
But it comes as Trump is facing controversy over connections to conspiracy theories.
"Even Trump Republicans, as Laura mentioned, are responding quickly."
"And I think that's also why Kelly Ward, who's the current chairwoman of the Arizona Republican party, I think she said it best last week at the rally as she introduced Donald Trump."
But Harris has not performed.
Donald Trump does what he says.
I want to just get your reaction to something that Donald Trump says a lot about Jewish Americans.
I know Governor Shapiro has been on the road.
"So now, once you see that, I think it's clear, like secretly right now, Kamala Harris is screaming after her fifth glass of Chardonnay into a pillow right now, screaming at the top of her lungs."
But the thing is I Think as we all know here it You know the polling aggregate does slightly favor Trump in Trump has unique point of strength here Cuz let's go to something like the 2000 election and you can see Gore was up for right 2004 Kerry was up two and a half 2008 Obama won by over 10 2012 by 5 so Trump's connection to the state with his economic policies Really is what drove him to victory a very narrow one against Hillary Clinton and even a loss that was still the most narrow in This century against Biden back in 2020.
"And then this part, which somewhat relates to it, right?"
And it's pretty funny to be on a bus that's wrapped in Republican voters against Trump.
"It may all come down to the electoral college, which rockets Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro to the top of the list."
"But you still find a lot of people who may not be viewing these ads and these promotions saying, what are her policies?"
I'm hopeful.
"And I you know, it just I saw the Joe Biden that I wish America had seen that night, unfortunately."
"Yeah, and the economy is something that has been the top issue throughout this campaign There's a lot of frustration still from a lot of voters about inflation Even though some of those numbers have come down more recently."
And the products are a joke and they don't actually produce anything.
Do we have any entrepreneurs in the house?
"A lot of fun here, everybody."
We have some sick people.
Pretty consistent if you ask me.
We do not need a president who's willing to make problems worse to make his politics better.
"And while a four point lead in Pennsylvania was absolutely phenomenal news for the Democratic Party, it had to be substantiated and pretty much reaffirmed by some consistency in data points."
"I'm excited that he is on Team Humanity, you know?"
"Her entire plan is to go full net zero beyond what Joe Biden has done for vice presidential candidate, Walls has done some 40 climate bills in Minnesota."
So we landed.
But it's also about what happened down at his golf course on September 15th.
Is that does I mean he's for sugar to win?
Let me show you this.
"When you hear Trump talk about the enemy from within, what do you hear?"
And Harris unveiled a new policy aimed at helping black men.
"A new poll in Pennsylvania, a new poll of 600 potential voters in Pennsylvania conducted by Susquehanna polling and research places Harris ahead by four percentage points in the state."
She's given hardly any interviews thus far.
"And I really think the naming of governor, Shapiro, could damage those chances."
And then the defense spending through the roof.
" Alright, so looks like we got some absolutely huge news coming out of the state of Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris."
"So I hope Elon Trump, RFK Jr. is going to be the dream team to make us healthy again, man."
"It got really bad around the time of the Afghanistan withdrawal, but even before then, she started to see a dip in approval, and she was unfavored pretty much nationwide."
"We need to come out in record numbers, but Nikki Lew is not getting them."
"As you could see what you see in the speeches of the leaders who are trading barbs at each other, making personal attacks, calling each other dangerous, the enemy within, calling them rabid, Donald Trump calling Kamala Harris rabid leftist, using that kind of language, threatening to deploy national guard, which is an empty threat though, because he's not the United States president."
And I know that we know this is true.
All I'm saying is this.
"Oh, okay."
" Join us now, Mike Allen, co-founder of Axios."
"If you look at those censures that you just mentioned, you know, over the past several years, the Arizona Republican Party has gone on record censuring just about everybody who has won a statewide election."
We want to turn now to Vice President Kamala Harris.
Because say what you want about Donald Trump.
We got boonies HQ.
"They have a long legacy of, you know, half of the state is gigantic, as more in common with the industrial Midwest than it does with the East Coast."
"No, it's okay."
"In case you thought this was going to go away, it's not."
"And because of this realignment that we're seeing by education in this country, and who the low propensity voters are, you know, they're doing a 180."
It doesn't make any sense.
"That just makes it much more difficult, I think, for the president to shine a light on the stronger elements of the economy, which do exist."
"His contribution is aimed at ensuring that Harris has the resources to implement her economic policies, which Lin believes will create a more equitable economy."
It's still around.
It's sure that the Democrats are behind.
"Yeah, she will lose ground."
And that is resonating with voters.
We are mostly Puerto Rican and Dominican.
The indictment from the Justice Department is full of both dangerous and also incredibly stupid details.
So I decided to go back and reread the clause.
Amisha Kamala Harris will follow Trump to North Carolina on Friday.
"Now, I do want to discuss the current state of the race in Pennsylvania because it is obvious it's a must win state for Trump."
"So, you know, it's a little bit."
And then all day today we've been crossing Pennsylvania and it's been a track.
"Looking back, I regret that vote."
"Larry, thanks so much for being here."
Reproductive rights or LGBTQ rights are kind of equally important.
"You know, we're seeing it, of course, in Arizona when they're, where they're announcing their big results today."
The election campaign in Pennsylvania is intense.
What he is doing in the halls of Congress again.
"And again, whether you like Joe Biden or not, and I think clearly Republicans are better on oil, but this administration has pumped more oil than any administration in the history of this country."
They're into the cooking world.
"However, in the 2020 US presidential election, Joe Biden won the electoral votes in Pennsylvania with 1.17 percent more votes than Trump."
"Yes, thank you."
Now I'm not going to sit here and say McDonald's is the best food you can eat now.
"I've got to tell you, it was a little word."
That does not fly with that voter at all.
"It's quite the divide, 50 to 34 percent."
"That's no longer the case, right?"
"But of course, the popular vote doesn't mean everything."
Let's talk about all of this and how pivotable it all is.
This would be a 3-point overperformance for Harris compared to Biden's winning margin in 2020.
"Some of you know that when I was growing up, I didn't have a father in the house."
"So I had a group of people, six people from across the political spectrum, voters, three of whom I'd spoken to before."
"Listen, at all."
" When you watch this clip, I want you to ask yourself, can you ever imagine Donald Trump acting this way towards voters?"
That didn't happen.
"TAMARA KEITH, The Cook Political Report, USAID, USAID, USAID."
"Nothing wrong with that, right?"
He's literally running for president.
We don't know because the as the audit it demonstrates very clearly Mr. Raskin.
"You don't have you know people that You don't need you don't need the buses you don't need to pay people to come to see Trump you don't need that You know, I mean you don't need none of that You literally have people that really comes to support Trump and listen what he has to say That's what you have you literally have that All these people That's lit red hats I Love it That's you need you need you need that kind of support this just goes to show you like real support though This is real support."
"He said, quote, it's clear the people hired by Arizona Senate leadership to supposedly bring integrity to our elections are instead just bringing incompetence."
"It's ironic because Obama definitely hates Biden and now Biden, I think definitely hates Kamala."
You could just breathe on him.
"They put in data from the liberal counties and you know, Maricopa is in its 172 K to 141 K. It is early."
You got a couple.
"He can actually bring over some independent Republican votes in the Commonwealth, which I think she would have a much harder time doing on her own."
"You have Erie, you have Pittsburgh, you have Harrisburg, you have you have you have Philadelphia, you have Scranton."
"Cracking 50, cracking 50, cracking 50 for multiple reasons."
"I mean, in recent elections, we have seen people turn out and vote with abortion on their minds, and that has very much benefited Democrats."
They like to sprinkles.
"Here, it's going to go down a little bit."
And Republicans are looking to win this district.
"So many veterans are upset about that, including here in Pennsylvania."
The only time Kamala Harris said frack was when she saw her poll numbers in Pennsylvania.
Philadelphia-based Democratic political consultant Mustafa Rashid says the governor will serve as a national surrogate for the Harris-Waltz ticket.
Why are they the way they are?
"It's a state, you know, four years ago, you and I spoke a number of times in that period in the run-up to the election, after the election, serving as attorney general for the state of Pennsylvania."
So what do you guys think?
We know that she's going to be obviously traveling today.
I go to community college.
"For 2,500 people to be watching our channel at once, concurrently, and then 50,000 total."
What on earth would possess you to vote for Trump again?
That that's what they found.
"And actually, it's a little bit more likely than the polls are leading on to."
Where's then the raw data?
"If they get in, your state is screwed."
"Drew, what are you guys noticing in Georgia right now?"
"If you look at the battleground states, Pennsylvania offers the most electoral votes out of all of them."
I would think it's a very big venue.
I guess you could argue that's a possibility.
"Like, this is so dumb, right?"
I wish there were more diverse candidates.
"I know you wanna talk about policy, and I respect that, but the reason that Donald Trump is not up 10 points is because of comments like that one, where people do have concerns about his fitness, his acuity, and his stability."
Everyone remembers what they are.
"So yeah, let me go ahead and just tune into that for a little bit, your heart, you know what I'm saying?"
You have the other party leadership.
"And I think had a very positive, just both personal experience and vibe as far as like getting people in that state excited, you know, to to vote for Kamala Harris, including a bunch of former Republicans, and there's a strong Senate candidate in that state that like very much appeals to these Nikki Haley, bulwark type voters and Alyssa Slotkin, who's like a strong national security Democrat."
"As he says this in Western Pennsylvania, you're going to be able to feel united as opposed to constantly feeling divided."
He claims that he built the entire military.
"And he's had some success with that, such that the Harris team is now worried."
So let me offer some sort of data to back that up.
Then he was supposed to return on March 4th and the like.
" Alright everyone, we have to talk about some political polling right now."
That's so good.
"Thank you so much, Jodie."
You don't look like a crime guy.
We've got a few more weeks to go.
"This isn't the first time Musk's inventions have found their way into the conflict, with Starlink also being used by both sides."
Absolutely unbelievable to me.
"You know, there's 100 Republicans now that have left and they're in Harris' camp."
"Just like Juicy Smee talking about, uh, these two quite retinics, it's Maga country in Chicago, in the polar vortex for real."
"What comes to places like Johnstown, which isn't often visited by presidential candidates in previous elections, is because this is where America got left behind, where people, when they offshored the steel industry and other manufacturing industries and even during the Biden administration, right, those inflation numbers, those jobs numbers, it's not even across the country."
So we're going to meet him and talk to him about why he you know supports Donald Trump and what he thinks about today's politics.
"The minute the polls open tomorrow, you'll be there."
"Before becoming Secretary of State, he spent a decade on Philadelphia's Board of Elections, where he investigated hundreds of claims of voter fraud and changed his mind."
"So I still think the election can be decided, you know, at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. Eastern time, which is when it was decided against Hillary."
And it's hard to know.
"Look, we're in March."
Getting shot almost shot at twice.
"""'He also has a Fulton County mugshot, ""'his own sneaker line and three baby mamas."
"Barack Obama's native state, Illinois, comes next."
"What do you think of Russell Wilson, by the way?"
"70, 75% of people support this."
I still think there's going to be a polling error one way or the other and also there are late deciders which is a small number of the vote but it wouldn't shock me if as tight as everything is down the middle if one candidate ends up sweeping every single state because that's what can happen with three or four percent.
And what do you make of what we've been hearing from the former president?
And 140 police officers were injured that day.
He endorsed us.
"There was a lot of controversy because Cornell West attempt to get on the ballot was actually being aided by Republican lawyers who were trying to make sure he could get on and so What the interviews of a couple of the electors said was they're like, hey when it was just Biden I was down with Cornell, but ever since Kamala was chosen."
And her approach has been to not just talk about them but to let people see it for themselves.
"He held a town hall meeting where he just, let me explain, because I've done a lot of town hall meetings."
"Yeah, it does feel like if they can't even get their strategy right in Philly, what hope do they have for the rest of Pennsylvania?"
"And you know, this whole talk about project 2025 and they're just trying to attach that to Trump and they're saying that that has nothing to do with Trump."
"And she's such an authentic, nice, warm person."
And they do this.
"In 2016, Sabatini wrote in a Republican Senator, Trump narrowly won Pennsylvania."
"On immigration, why do you support Kamala Harris?"
We're Americans together.
"Huge number, actually 21.9%, almost 22%."
And we see that in Georgia.
So they're coming in.
Bar earrings are all the rage.
This is a tragedy.
And Democrats strategists dismiss it away.
Yay!
We have to hold those that are responsible for the 2020 presidential election scam.
Is this a racial thing that I'm unaware of?
"Yet again, a tie emerges in a third Beacon research poll with both candidates tied at 49%."
"She has a four-point lead in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania."
We'll get to that in a moment.
They've been called fickle because they're not a reliable age group to actually show up to the polls.
They want him dead.
I'm invincible.
"First up, let's talk about Kamala Harris."
Here's the good news.
Mount him to your wall.
"I think it could impact the discourse, but so far the discourse has not really impacted the general election quite a bit, although I will say that if Hunter does not get jail time, it's going to be really hard to justify putting Trump in jail and seeing it significantly hurt him because that's just going to be the two-tier justice system on full display, unlike anything we've ever seen."
They want to win.
Lots of fun stuff.
She's from California.
Do you feel do you feel happy right now?
And this is a stunning performance for Donald Trump who in no other election cycle ever even got close to 49 percent.
"This is a specter that I think, you know, Mao's China, Stalin would have envied to have the ability to impose this clean economy through the massive organs of the state in which they're able to do it."
"Then throughout the speech, Donald Trump was praising his lawyer or spokesperson, Alina Habba."
There is truly a heartbeat.
"They love using law fair to get their agenda done, but that's CNN burning on Kamala Harris."
"And if you look at the polling that I'm seeing the the bounce that Kamala Harris got leading up to the convention, that's already starting to diminish as people begin to wonder why she is not being more specific about public policy positions or she has continued to be wishy washy fracking being the most vivid example."
"And to your point, Haley has not made it seem that she wants her supporters to vote for Biden, although she also hasn't endorsed Trump."
You see it in the range of how AOC talks about this issue to how John Federman talks about it and everything in between.
"Now here in 2024, Democrats enter this cycle with far less momentum than 4 years ago."
"But look though, I mean, Kamala or Biden is the same thing."
That is also for all minorities.
"When you get the Presidential Medal of Freedom, it's usually for other things like you've achieved great success in sports or you've achieved great success someplace else."
"No, because I feel that for the last eight plus years that the country has really changed in such a way that is not good."
And so that's why I think I have a responsibility to speak up and use a platform I have to hopefully push for a change and course on what has been unfolding across the Middle East for as long as I've been alive.
Incredibly strong and incredibly fragile.
"Now to be fair, it was expected that we're going to see less mail-in votes for obvious reasons, but Democrats have two major problems here."
But Pennsylvania Kamala Harris.
And so they're getting nervous.
But what's driving the early voting surge in Pennsylvania?
"In the fourth poll, also conducted by Fabrizio Ward, on the exact same dates with a different 400 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 47%."
"And you see it show up at these neighborhood offices that Kamala Harris has put in place where they're showing up not just to take a shift, but also showing up and saying, hey, listen, I'm not a registered Democrat, but I still want to be part of this campaign."
"Traditionally, Erie and Northampton County have been voting for the winner since I want to believe since I don't I want to think."
"And that, in my opinion, is probably going to come from polly markets."
"The electoral landscape of Pennsylvania is of paramount importance for any presidential candidate, particularly for Kamala Harris, as it has historically served as a bellwether state that can decisively influence the overall outcome of elections."
"So far, there's only 76 K votes."
"And then they talk about the Vice President nominee, J.D."
"I mean, this is, I'm going to have to go in and make an updated map at this point because of this, you know, it's going to take a few more polls to be able to say definitively what the trend is here."
And I really don't know what to do.
It's one of the reasons I'm here to support him and let everyone know we won't be intimidated.
"Clean energy is the little that's the key word that they use to say that it's going to be electric, clean energy."
Let's get them some French fries.
"And, you know, I think the world of Bryce, he's also got another pretty good LSU guy in there."
He understood that some values transcend party.
"And the anecdotal feeling, and the data, really, is they're looking at like who's showing up to vote early there, you know, and when you're going to doors of people that Dave identified as being maybe iffy, you know, kind of the feedback that they're getting on those doors."
These Republicans want their old state back.
That's what we're going to get.
I'm sometimes frustrated with politics.
Ed O'Keefe found that few voters are undecided when it comes to the hot-button issue of immigration.
Where the election is too close to call.
Just like the economy when it's run by Donald J. fucking Trump.
"The official said nearly 2,000 North Carolinians signed up to volunteer during Tuesday night's debate."
"Things are changing in the traditional states as well as much as they remain the same, though, you know, states like New York, states like New Jersey, states like Maine, states like Washington, states like Washington, D.C., states like Delaware, states like California primarily remain blue, states like Florida, states like Texas."
These are Democrats saying this.
I think everybody knows it.
Although it is true that he did get Laxalt's victory in 2014 wrong.
"Some of those folks will end up voting third party, but some of those folks will also end up voting for Harris or Trump in the end."
We are not governed by the laws of linear TV.
"But again, that's not too much to worry for the Republican Party."
"Yes, a Civil War link in the description, archived of course."
The fourth poll was conducted between September 18 and 20th by RMG Research among 783 likely voters.
"I think she's it's gonna be a hopefully not a tie, but I think it's gonna be close race."
It should be a wake-up call.
You want to take a look at Westmoreland County.
"Remember, the last time around 80 percent of the black men vote, the black male vote went to Joe Biden."
But Nikki Liu is not getting them.
"I think the most disconcerting part when you hear the most aggressive, darkest themes from Donald Trump is that you also have to consider that it reflects the support of a large portion of this country."
That's for sure.
"There's no common sense We need a change of leadership simple simple Voters know man and right now Trump is skyrocketing in Millions and millions of people say Trump won the debate on the side of voters say Trump won the debate We believe Trump wanted to debate and I wish that uh, they would he he want to took so much of their bait as It was a three verse one But he still came out on top man Which is the economy before the debate Donald Trump 53 after the debate 55 Kamala Harris before 37 after after 35 so virtually no movement on that and if anything, I know it's margin of error But it went down a little bit Again cuz she couldn't answer she couldn't answer she dodged She dodged the questions What did you expect after dodging the equal the questions, what did you expect?"
"Instead, the organizers of this has said that you needed to sign up essentially to be a participant in it in order to in order to be able to witness what was happening."

I bet he's so unbearably smug right now deserves to be.
"He was saying that he wasn't necessarily going to accept the results of the campaign I mean, he's never been shy about saying exactly What he intends to do and what he how he intends to respond So in one of the debates that fall with Hillary Clinton there was the question was asked You know, are you going to abide by the results of the election if you lose and he said well not necessarily stay tuned We'll have we'll see what happens each tonight."
It's something that there's been a lot of interviews in the media here with undecided voters and they all sort of have different issues that that they're concerned about or going back and forth between the candidates on.

"This week, the Trump campaign and the RNC forced Waltz administration in Minnesota to inactivate over a thousand voters on the rolls who could be non-citizens or ineligible to vote."
