"All the trailers that you see parked upon the northern border that block anybody's site onto the grounds, all brought here by the people who own them parked there to keep it more safe and secure, not just for the president, but for everybody attending."
Senator Casey.
Please stay safe and thank you for doing this work for us tonight.
"I feel like it was hard for me, but I was brave enough to be without my mom."
So good luck to all those involved.
"Yeah, that's malignant narcissism right there."
And former Republican mid-state congressman Charlie Dent says having Shapiro on the ticket could make the difference in the Commonwealth.
A sample size large enough.
You're not going to leave.
You got it.
So Harris absolutely can take the state too.
And right now what they did was they flooded the country with people who they think they can bribe into voting for their candidates.
The electorate at large has become very polarized to the point where the number of states that are actually winnable for either candidate like they're both at play has dwindled.
"Come and thumbs up this video, subscribe to the channel, hit the bell notification, hit all notifications so you have my videos in your possession each and every time I go live, I do upload."
"They gained roughly 5,000 on net this week, which is huge."
"You know, I'm still the same person I was before I put that information out."
"And on that, I mean, there's a lot of speculation that the minute she actually has to do that and debate Trump, that's when it's quite possible."
"You know, it's great to be out here in the atmosphere."
Particularly in the Miami-Dade area.
"And he did not disavow her, did not condemn her comments."
"Obviously, it depends on the race that we're talking about, but that's kind of why pollsters miss so badly in Michigan, in Wisconsin."
"Either way, my YouTube channel is officially the place to be."
And I will let you know exactly why the reason is that Kamala Harris is going to ultimately win the state of Pennsylvania.
"Now, Trump is pointing to FBI statistics and saying they're not the best one."
And wonderfully honest.
Spread the word.
So the Kennedy campaign has been a disaster from the very beginning.
I think that's pretty fair to say different lies.
It's not even like he's talking like a Republican.
And it's true.
It doesn't matter what happens in Michigan.
You have to win everything.
I need you.
This is nice.
"He's in Pennsylvania campaigning for us, not me, for us."
"If the trend holds and Harris secures Pennsylvania along with Michigan and Wisconsin, she is all but guaranteed to win the presidency."
"Now, does this mean that he's going to do four to five points better in Pennsylvania?"
It's obvious.
Governor Mike DeWine saying he trusts city officials.
You can just use your finger and it responds to touch and you can transmit it to a secure central processing server.
They're all trying to come back to that question of who's fighting for you and providing voters with an answer that Democrats and Republicans are doing just that.
The stage is now set for the first face-off and meeting between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
You can't really get rid of the farmer.
They actually have a good reputation as far as being church-going and being hard-working.
"So I do think all that social media attention does help, absolutely."
"But I think at the end of the day, whatever the polls say on election day is gonna be your biggest guide."
There was one Harris waltz.
"Well, guys, everyone's excited going into the weekend because you got this solar eclipse happening on Monday."
"They maybe haven't seen a campaign like this because of covid, because of the things that's happening."
"And because Donald Trump feels like making stuff up, you've got hard work and public servants who cannot do their jobs."
These Republicans want their old state back.
But I would say there's sort of an overperformance function.
"But yes, competition is expected to get intense."
The second gentleman's head.
"And that's the best way to actually make your case to the American people is if they disagree with you, have a conversation with them."
This is another reminder of how hopelessly biased 60 Minutes is and how correct President Trump was to decline their invitation to be subjected to their fake news hackery.
And it's kind of illustrative as to his thoughts on the abortion issue in general.
"Even Aniskoff, with all her experience, she can't work miracles."
"But now not only is he not doing any harm, he's doing a lot of good for the Kamala Harris campaign."
"Each state presents unique challenges and opportunities for both candidates, with narrow margins indicating that every vote will be critical.As the campaigns continue to unfold, it will be essential for both Harris and Trump to adapt their strategies based on voter feedback and changing dynamics in these key battlegrounds."
"Oh, my God, dude."
We appreciate it.
"Kamala Harris, again, Kamala Harris is up to now when Hillary Clinton was really up four point five."
"In fact, I think it's an unconstitutional law, and it's a distraction from all the other stuff he's done that implicates his father."
And we're just getting started.
"I think nuclear politics, as we've seen, based on social media, based on who runs it, is that they do very much have partisan beliefs."
"First up, Donald Trump zigzagged between economic remarks and personal insults at a rally in critical Pennsylvania."
"Yeah, we're watching the results roll in for the GOP nomination for governor."
So we'll have to see what happens on that front.
"Of the vote that the Democrats will get in the election, 44% of that will come from Philadelphia and the suburban counties around Philadelphia."
"I mean, I studied logic in high school and thought I was good at it, but I guess, like you, I'm rusty."
"Yeah, no, this is nice."
Let me tell you that Donald Trump is doing rallies nonstop around the country.
Kamala Harris back one of the strongest border protection bills that this country has seen in decades.
"But it's a historical moment that matters in rallying people, boosting morale and telling people you need to get out, you need to vote."
It's something that there's been a lot of interviews in the media here with undecided voters and they all sort of have different issues that that they're concerned about or going back and forth between the candidates on.
You just say Hannibal Lecter.
"You sidestep that crap, but you want us to go hard to paint and support this sister, as you call her, even though her family has a history of being slave owners themselves in Jamaica, right?"
"She went to a county you've probably never heard of, Beaver County, in the southwestern corner of our state."
"And while it may not be the margin the Democrats were hoping for with Shapiro, its 19 electoral votes will still end up in the Kamala Harris column."
I have.
So that's why we're talking to you tonight.
"Yeah, John, that's the way to phrase it to the American people."
"Again, there's no actual evidence this happened."
I'm just saying that's what the private polling is showing.
"Trump, hands down."
And what could happen and this is something to always remember with primaries.
And independent voters are also lagging.
And the article kind of hints that this might not just be a Philly thing.
Don't try to sanitize it and color it up for them.
"So he won by half the amount You know in Pennsylvania's he didn't Wisconsin or vice versa, right?"
"And they are very worried that that is going to translate into low voter turnout, which is why you see this huge effort tonight and in the days ahead on this particular group."
You have to come out if you want these policies that will help you and your children in the future.
So I'll be voting no for that reason.
"So you know, this is something that could be like a plus 9,000 margin."
"They tell you what people are willing to share, not necessarily what they're really thinking or how they'll actually vote when it's just them in that ballot."
"Look, we'll see."
"Are we to now read that the big money in America, the super PACs are all backing Kamala Harris?"
That's why We are supporting him.
"Another question, Joe D. What are your thoughts on the Biden hair strategy was to deplete the strategic petroleum reserve to help reduce the cost of gas starting prior to the midterms?"
"Tonight, Vice President Kamala Harris made her pitch to voters in the Southeast Valley."
"The former president was, you may see this better than me from the footage, removed by a Secret Service detail that seemed to pounce immediately."
"What that is saying is that this is a population that needs to hear more, and she's responding to that need by answering the call and putting out an agenda and saying, here I am, ask me questions, I'm ready to serve you."
"I'm just shocked at the possibility that a lying, bigoted demagogue couldn't be persuaded to change by facts and an appeal to his humanity."
I cannot stress to you how close this election is y'all.
The sun would be beaming down.
It kind of just depends on what people feel or what their own political audits say.
And that's basically where we are.
You think she's heard this advice?
"I think he just needs to get out, talk about what his record is and talk about the vision he has for America."
And I think that was a decision that showed good judgment.
"There's what Trump says, and then there's easily observable reality."
I don't think they've walked it back.
"Luzerne is Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania."
"And because Pennsylvania is a smaller version of America, you know, that's in terms of the urban and rural and suburban."
"It's just a slow-moving coup now, and they're trying to pull it off without too many people noticing, which is why we have to pass urgently needed voting and election reforms and hold the people who stage the insurrection responsible."
What does that do to the education of American children when their teachers aren't teaching them but they're focused on kids who don't have the legal right to be here?
"Well, obviously there are quite a few developments here in Georgia."
"And if so, why is it that way?"
So black men who make them know their money is safe.
 We begin with the race for the White House where former President Barack Obama hit the campaign trail for Kamala Harris in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania on Thursday.
It didn't need confirmation or affirmation by the Cyber Ninjas.
"And so I think many Pennsylvanians are aware of the impact it is not just in America, but throughout the world."
Is she Indian or is she black?
So naturally Trump isn't wasting any time.
Trump flipped it.
So who is that?
"He doesn't hold the administration, so he has no power to deploy national guard or the US military, but giving out such threats."
And Harris rose to the top of the ticket.
I would be shocked if the ultimate winner of the election wasn't the person who won Pennsylvania.
"Yo, when I tell you this is crazy, so there was an attempt on Trump's life at the rally in Pennsylvania, right?"
Ah hell yeah.
"Well, why are you losing to a convicted felon in what you try to claim as your home state or one of your home states?"
How come you're leading in the polls and you can't?
And as independents?
I'm curious because I don't see how it's a high-quality poll far from it.
"And in the White House, she will have an outstanding partner in Governor Tim Walz."
You can see this is the updated count.
"But the point is, is that that wasn't as much third party vote in Pennsylvania as there was back in 2016."
Just saying.
"Zach, the Harris campaign is unveiling a new agenda aimed at attracting black male voters."
But she got credit for being this Reagan speechwriter.
A man had character.
"And he gained margin here because of the amount of vote increase that Biden had in Philadelphia County, even though it did shift Republican by 3 percentage points."
"Let's take a look then at the latest polls in each of these competitive states, going region by region, starting with the Southwest duo of Nevada and Arizona."
Many of them don't want to vote Trump for whatever the reason may be.
What the hell have you been doing the whole time?
Pennsylvania put President Joe Biden over the top in 2020 and is expected to play a big role in this year's election.
"Recent polls show Harris leading Trump in key states like Arizona and North Carolina, although she trails slightly in Nevada and Georgia."
They see Donald Trump brag about Vladimir Putin.
"So, this area is when you want to get Allegheny County if you're Harris and you want to lose by less in those pro-Trump surrounding counties."
That's un-American.
"No, but I would say it's clear as day that Trump is a favorite."
You don't get two chances with anybody named Lady Ruby.
"Diane Blake â€“ $500,000 Diane Blake, a billionaire philanthropist from Philadelphia, is known for her commitment to social justice and educational reform."
I know the polls didn't have him up by like three to four and I'm not even saying he's going to win the state by this margin.
They will get him to the hospital.
There's a Trump Trump.
"One thing was that it was more to the point of, was there sufficient evidence or action that we could justify the recalling of the electors?"
Be happy.
"Why does it seem like Democrats don't get credit or why does it seem like Republicans have been able to co-op this idea of family values when in fact, like your agenda with education, it's Democrats, it's people like you who are actually protecting the foundations of our family and protecting the future of this country by helping kids where they need it most, which is education, which is making sure they're fed."
They're trying to make it the other way.
Bob Casey is an honorable man.
And he's already done the first two.
It makes you a patriot.
"I mean, you know, you're seeing events that, you know, moderate Republicans, Republicans for Harris, Republicans for a guy."
USA Today and Suffolk had Harris up three.

The waves would be crashing into my face.
State parties didn't give us enough support.
So I want to I want to go north of Allegheny.
"No, I will never buy a home, but I am middle class."
"But for the most part, this is, as you said, you know, as the AP reported, fewer than 200 cases involving this sort of chicanery."
And they come up with all sorts of nonsense with I'm a threat.
"And that, you know, a name like mine of the last and what is as American as any other in the city like Dearborn is the greatest American city because we are so diverse and beautiful."
"But at the same time, as has always been true, we should expect a degree of polling error."
I think he could actually be a unique actor to break through the nonsense and the silos that we have carved out on this issue politically.
I don't think it's worn off yet.
"He has argued also in terms of policy, of course, in terms of mass deportation."
"I mean, you ask, even with these softball interviews, they'll say, well, what is your specific plan to lower the price of groceries and housing in Kamala Harris and say, well, I grew up in a middle class family."
"And so kind of how that all plays out, obviously, I don't know yet."
And he just needed one of them at that point as well.
"Recent polling data suggests that Trump is currently favored in several key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Georgia."
"The visits that Harris made to regions such as Beaver County, which are often given less attention by national campaigns, were particularly acknowledged by him."
They were I I shouldn't even say that they just vanished.
"You have a shirt here and it's Trump, and then you've put duct tape over another name."
"It trended red, not necessarily shift, but trended red in 2020 and Republicans have flipped statewide offices."

"My fellow Americans, make America great again, and all that that represents, and it has only just begun."
It reinforces the public polling.
"These poor, all these poor local weather people, haven't they been through enough?"
And you have to talk to those voters and connect with them and talk about how we're going to make their lives better.
So great.
I think I'm gonna cancel my trip.
"That's where they played at Well, you said the coyotes are not thought that was the mullet So you know I've been doing this for a long time Yeah I mean we've been doing the show together for less than a year, but you know we've been in radio forever Okay doing talking about politics every once in a while you and I have been asked a question over the last 48 hours That we've never been asked before never never never I've been sitting in this chair for 26 years this month I've never been asked this question You want to take a guess what the question is Bruce has never been asked this question Um it's it's about I have no clue I can't imagine about Harris It's about her rally So go ahead Bruce."

"Now, I talk about the I call them ping pong counties a lot, like Erie County up in the Northwest."
She needs to be running multiple points ahead.
That's all that matters.
Don't forget to vote.
"If you're a Republican, there would have to be a crazy deviation that we haven't seen in over two decades for it to signal a Harris victory because if she wins the popular vote by a point, she's not winning the electoral college even with the recent shifts we're going to that we've seen in New York and possibly Illinois and California and Florida and all of those states are getting more conservative."
It was a Friday.
"That is, if I have the geography correct in Bucks County, which that's where you grow up, Robert."

" Join us now, Mike Allen, co-founder of Axios."
We don't have to say it.
"A concrete room turned Democratic dungeon filled with yard signs, briefing packets for volunteers, and campaign literature."
And it's an area that I think is up for grabs right now.
"Well, look, she is holding an event in Bucks County, Pennsylvania."
What are people in Pennsylvania saying now?
Do you think Democrats can hide the real Kamala Harris from America for 100 days?
"And it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by a national guard or if really necessary, by the military."
Can I have a little?
But GOP voters have turned in more ballots than any other voters.

"And now I've been predicting whether it was Joe Biden or where now that it is the vice president Harris, I knew that was gonna be close."

Kind of think the wedge between Ohio and West Virginia in that area.
Not not over Israel but mostly just over the same thing that hit Nina Turner over which is that she's not a good enough Democrat.
"And at that point, I think Harris the favorite, because if you lose a single state of your Trump, not just, you know, oh, he could afford to lose Wisconsin, but still win somewhere else."
You do not either.
And I will see you guys in the next one.
"If your coworkers acted like that, they wouldn't be your coworkers for very long."
A little tiny shift in Philadelphia in terms of raw vote percentages and turnout is more than enough to flip the state.

"Having these people, you know, basically start the conversation with Democrats like Kamala Harris will give a permission structure for a lot of these Republican voters out there to know that it is okay to like kind of like as a gateway to, it is okay to vote for Democrats and the policies that Democrats are espoused are not going to lead to the end of the world."
"At the start of the request cycle, it was 64% Democrat and only 25% Republican."
Who can believe it?
"He's done such an unbelievable job for North Carolina, for Georgia, for Alabama, for Florida, for Tennessee."
About how the president's reacting to this in terms of does he believe it's appropriate does he agree with what Governor Shapiro is saying about how this needs to be investigated.
Donald Trump's most efficient path to 270 electoral college votes would be to win the Sun Belt swing states of North Carolina and Georgia and flip Pennsylvania.

It was gross.
And these are the counties that Biden won in 2020 that helped him flip the state back from Trump.
Is that an important issue?
 Donald Trump just got great news out of the key swing state of Pennsylvania.
Now just because you are registered as a Republican means nothing.
"But nuclear politics, I'm only using as a point of reference because their website is really strong in comparison to some others, and also tells us a lot about where Biden was and where Harris is now, just as a point of reference, as a point of comparison, but I will say, I do not believe Kamala Harris is up by one point, sorry, Donald Trump is up by 1.8% in Pennsylvania right now, because what we have seen is a massive, massive reduction in terms of support from the past for Trump compared to when he was running against Biden."
"And I never am deleting people's ish unless they say something absolutely just so foul and flucked up Sometimes you got to go into the editor and um, you know The system will put certain stuff where it needs to be approved And like I said, typically I approve everything unless it's just something so foul and flucked up But um his comments just gone nothing in the editor But he says it's clear what happened."

"The other person who's a named plaintiff in this case, he is a Fox News commentator."
She's up 0.6% of the five way.

And they said that Biden has blood on his hands.
"So the audit, to an extent, has already served the goals of the people who are behind it, was to create the questions that never should have existed to begin with."
I don't care anything about just feelings.
And then the situation escalated.

People just don't feel it.

"She's got to acknowledge that and obviously that's gonna be a big part of this debate, the issue of economy, but the issue of cost of living and she has taken that on as it relates to her policy agenda or focus and that's the compelling future."
"I don't know, but you're in Pennsylvania, but you're actually running in Ohio."
"Between now and election day, the narrative is going to be that she's loser on top of the strikes on top of now, the federal emergency management efforts in North Carolina."
He will take away that $35 cap on insulin.
This can only happen.
"It was great, I'm not lying."
And I think losing Pennsylvania in that way would be kind of a blow to their narrative of wanting to triumph over that assassination attempt.
And we probably have to move on pretty soon but just to run through a couple of the others that the Democratic primary Senate has become a sleeper.
"Crooks, Thomas Matthew Crooks, Matthew Thomas Crooks, and this guy, Ryan Wesley Ruth or Ralph."
I'm telling you.
President Biden has tariffs in place.
We are not governed by the laws of linear TV.
"And, you know, she has I've never seen a candidate have such a treasure trove of information that pushes back on everything and anything that they're trying to portray portray that she is today."
So you're there.
"I just know he's dropping a new book, Bulletproof."
"But so it says a Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, posted on social media that the ruling was quote, a victory for Pennsylvania's fundamental right to vote."
Love that dude.
"And so, OK, we've talked about the cultural aspect of things, but let's talk money for a second, because you're a top member of the Harris campaign's finance team."
Which is exactly why we need Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States of America.
So this is the type of scene that we're seeing.
I'm not poor.
Look at this right here.
It sounds like their argument is not exactly that these people moved out of state and cast their ballots while out of state.
You would just need Nevada.
Stierwald's insights regarding the importance of Erie County and Northampton County highlight how local issues can significantly influence voter sentiment.
"But he says even though he hid classified documents that he stole, asserted every invalid, improper privilege that exists."
I can guarantee you that Kerry Lake's not losing the state by six or seven.
And here's why.
Either of these states could play a pivotal role in putting him over the top and making him that presumptive winner.
Violence.
"You see Arizona's got 11, Nevada's got six, Minnesota's got 10, 10, right?"
"Greitens didn't drop out, but Parnell did."
"At this point, it almost doesn't matter."
"And yet he went to the floor of the House of Representatives to say, wait, my election counts."
The only reason he didn't get a lot more done is because they gave him grief every minute of every day.
"They say, you know what?"
Are you planning on voting for Donald Trump and JD Vance?
"And look, I mean, we can make light of it."
And this is the World Bank of the suburban voters and the middle class households.
"Oh, Donald Trump."
What happened there was they had a law in Pennsylvania where they couldn't count the mail in an absentee votes until election day.
That's what they're trying to make.
We're getting the wall street journal guy.
"But we do know this, a look at the real clear politics averages for the Pennsylvania presidential vote."
He has to continue to do that because people cannot allow Harris to run as a disconnected figure.
"He's back in the heartland, Trump is."
"Joe Biden may not be on the ticket, but his presence looms large over the 2024 election, casting a significant shadow and influence."
"It's all there publicly, but Donald Trump's gonna, Donald Trump, meaning he's just gonna go out there and lie."
"It straight up calls out the Harris campaign for being, quote, poorly run in Pennsylvania."
So yeah Kamala is angry at the Pennsylvania state and local officials.
"The middle class constitutes no, wait, wait, wait."
"Well, I don't think the rambling is the problem."
This is walls in Pennsylvania.
"Yeah, good morning, Emery here in Tucson yesterday Trump unveiled a new policy It's part of his overreaching tax policy that he's been kind of dribbling out along the campaign trail and the newest policy is no tax Overtime take a listen to what he had to say yesterday about that in Tucson I'm also announcing that as part of our additional tax cuts We will end all Taxes on overtime that gives people more of an incentive to work It gives the companies a lot it's a lot easier to get the people Now it's important to note though that any changes to tax policy require an act of Congress You can't unilaterally change it with a stroke of the pen You must work with Congress to get anything changed there But unveiling this policy also goes along with Trump's no tax on tips policy that he unveiled in Las Vegas earlier in the summer And also the policy of no tax on Social Security benefits So Trump has been hammering these points home and talking about them very often on the campaign trail because his tax cuts expire in 2025 So at the center of this entire campaign with all the policies going on immigration abortion It might all come down to tax policy Emery That's what's been really fascinating from the campaign trail is that's what they've been focusing on and unveiling these new tax policies Yeah, it is interesting and just a sort of reminder if you're gonna reduce Income then you got to find another place to find that revenue if you're if you're not gonna be taxing overtime You're not gonna be taxing tips and you know well for both campaigns We still have to hear sort of the full scope of what their plan is for the economy just days ago Trump was calling for additional debates against Harris now."
Secret service comes rushing in.
This is according to a Washington Post poll that just came out.
And the economy is very important in Pennsylvania.
"If you're a Republican, you should be 10,000 times angry at him."
So here we are.
"We're going to get number one, your utility."
And by the way I don't think anybody should be in prison for marijuana or jail for marijuana.
You don't have to vote for this administration again.
You're here!
I'd rather try the case than be the defendant.
"But look, we get out there and we got to make sure that if this election is as tight as it could be, that we're the ones who are on the winning side and not them."
It's been such an unexpected change.
And you're thinking about sitting down and I'm speaking to men directly.
"In 2016, in 2020, Biden carried the county by about 1500 votes."
What are you watching?
So you go back a long time.
So we're going to meet him and talk to him about why he you know supports Donald Trump and what he thinks about today's politics.
"Then they went for Biden, but narrowly in 2020 in a lot of places."
"She, you know, Biden won it by two point eight."
So he is everywhere.
But there were some names in there you would be surprised at frankly because I had my little spats.
What role does Pennsylvania play in Kamala Harris' presidential campaign?
"They keep democracy here, especially after January 6th at their insurrection."
And do you think that may have hurt his chances in any way?
"And when you, when you have the regulation that is hamstringing us from being able to do that, it's really going to hurt all of us."
"And then when Hillary Clinton came in, she went all the way down to 37 with Joe Biden at about 40% of the votes in 2020."
"They are actually, look, they're doing it as we speak."
" Major political primaries slated for Tuesday, testing former President Trump's endorsement power in Arizona, Michigan, Kansas, Missouri and Washington state."
"So I'm not sure if there's going to be any updated numbers this morning, but hopefully they will continue to be dumped in so we can see exactly which way the state's going to be going here."
"This meeting was the same day, I believe, that the governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, certified Biden as the winner of the presidential election in Arizona."
"Now, I will say, county polling is either very accurate or very inaccurate."
There are multiple videos on the internet.
"Drew, what are you guys noticing in Georgia right now?"
I'm Enjoy your day and thanks for coming.
I don't want anything for this.
"Correct Major, this is actually going to be the vice president's 10th visit to Pennsylvania since becoming the presidential nominee."
"While inside, Al Schmidt oversaw the counting of a record 375,000 mail-in ballots, most of them from Democratic voters."
And we actually got a Harris plus three last night after two nights in a row of Trump plus three.
Those blue pens the counters have could potentially be used to mark the ballots.
"And I said, that's totally new to me."
"Well, again, my organization is Early Vote Action."
"So if you're a Republican, you want Trump to about age, but he's still talking about age because he can't get off his old talking points."
But it seems a little inappropriate to me but that's Kamala Harris.
"Lest you think that I am taking Congressman Gosar out of context here and just cherry picking the one part where he seems a little lost in his own haze, I'm telling you, trust me, it's all like this from him."
You see lawyers for Harris.
Maybe it's somehow overstates Trump.
"Harrisburg, Pennsylvania today, reporting to you live."
"It's a state that, you know, Scott Walker had been governor of for a number of years."
90% of that stuff is straight up garbage.
Like her changing her position on fracking.
We can spend a little more time.
Harris declined repeated request for an interview for this story.
"So it's one thing to show up, but it's another thing to actually listen and understand the needs of that community."
Jess finished up with JD Vance who was in Pittsburgh just now in the city.
So this is really big stuff and it's good.
"And in our state, even though there has been no evidence of any wrongdoing, all of the audits done, all of the sample hand counts done, all of the lawsuits done have turned up absolutely no evidence of a problem."
"Again, we've never been more secure than we are now, but unfortunately, we've kind of got to secure ourselves against ourselves."
I mean if you're gonna do it do it right and yes that is patriotism at its best.
It didn't but there is an EV plant today building batteries there.
It's going to be huge.
"And by the way, if you were a betting person, Jenna Ellis would have been the ideal person to come forward early because she's already done so in other cases."
I fought to protect this country and keep it from socialism and Trump's values align with my values in that regard.
You know that.
"It's just being juicy, bro, really."
She did it on crowd size.
And then this is interesting.
This is a man who does not tolerate profanity or inappropriate language of any kind.
But Rodriguez says the Montgomery County native could be more outspoken for pro-immigrant policies.
"So the first one that a lot of people talk about is Western Pennsylvania, particularly the greater Pittsburgh area."
One thing you notice when you get here is just the enhanced security.
Do you h that may be seeing this?
So you kind of have to do both things.
"It comes with a 20-year prison sentence, if convicted."
What do you put that down to?
Not to mention those are some of those intimidating calls you can imagine ever getting.
I'm going to replace it.
"Oops, here's the report."
Both of them are living and they're going to be fine.
"You know, it's emotionally draining, right?"
"I said, no, thank you."
It's never about turning Somerset red.
It was a packed weekend for Donald Trump.
Same thing.
"If she was able to select Pennsylvania's governor as surrender mate, Josh Shapiro, but there was a little bit of a problem because the Democrats have an issue with anti-Semitism in the party."
So I wouldn't run away from that.
Say what you want about Biden.
I want everybody to take a deep breath.
"And I mean, the surprise on your face, it was it was a shock, but it was also it looked like enjoyment as well."
"This is what we talked about a lot on Friday, right?"
"Now it's been it's been two attempted assassinations, one where a bullet actually actually hit him."
And the immortal words of Dr. Martin Luther King ring in our ears that we must judge one another by the content of our character and not the color of our skin.
This is really the first time in a while he's been meaningfully leaning in Pennsylvania.
Let's walk down this line.
But even now they're even closer.
"We would have won, it would have been armed."
"Oh, Kamala Harris, absolutely."
"That 80,000 number, I want everybody to write that on the chalkboard in your brain."
And one result of all this intentional doubt?
So extremely close.
"You know, so, so why would people be getting second and third jobs?"
India Abroad.
I know I'm doing my level best to speak to every Latino voter.
"Picking a guy who, look, served this country as a football coach, as a teacher, really has been delivering in Minnesota for his people there."
"And as I see here, look at this man."
"Biden's administration said from the lectern, the White House press secretary, that he would not, not use executive privilege to shield Donald Trump with the release of information or evidence relating to the January 6th insurrection."
He's a hot mess.
Got it.
I don't trust the guy.
"He could lose Georgia hypothetically and still win, but North Carolina, it does seem as if he's probably not going to lose it."
"My mother worked hard, raised me and my sister, and by the time I was in high school, she was able to afford our first time."
"It is Tuesday, August 6th, and this is being recorded at 5.26 a.m."
"Because if you don't have the right team, the right strategy, it doesn't matter how much money you have."
You could see Erie County went for Biden by around one with the 2020 demography and Northampton County went blue by around 0.7%.
"It's OK, as long as our side wins."
"And I don't know who's building this is, but if they had air conditioning, do you see any air conditioning?"
"No, I just said Joe left the first day of the DNC and then the Obama showed up the next day."
"Keep in mind, he's been active in politics now in that area."
"So I think not only can she build on the coalition that Biden put together last time, but I think she's in a really strong position to really focus on the issues that matter a lot in the burbs."
"Haitian voodoo might be real, but you know what else is real?"
I agree with you.
Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body.
"Five point five average error, five point five partisan bias in favor of the Republicans."
So Tim Walz comes from a very interesting path.
Is it possible that she takes it maybe in reverse?
One of the reasons why we fixed more roads and bridges than ever before is because of our partnership with the Biden-Harris administration.
"Rather than merely pursuing partisan agendas, he underlined that the problem of protecting democratic values would be the primary focus of the election that would take place in 2024."
"Since then, obviously, there's been the vice presidential debate."
" Turning now to the midterms with less than 70 days to go, all eyes are on Pennsylvania."
They are a serious threat in two ways.
I've only voted for Barack Obama.
But Pennsylvania could be a critical state and the willingness of a massive number of people to show up has to count for something.
This source points out a bunch of other polls showing similar trends.
Let's read it really quick.
You're gonna have leaders who try to help and then there you have a guy who will just lie about it to score political points and this has consequences.
Tim cast music.
I'm very excited for 2028.
But Trump has not endorsed anyone in that Senate race.
" Now with three weeks to go until the US presidential election, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have held rival campaign events in the battleground state of Pennsylvania."
And they're taking in from the Trump campaign and how that's being received by the voters you're talking to.
Just unposed the video here because of the guidelines for this video.
Would you be my running mate and let's get this thing on the road?
"Now, I'm not saying that's all because of new voters."
"Even if you had a family member who acted like that, you might still love them, but you tell them you've got a problem."
We want our wives and children's futures.
"Meanwhile, Trump is targeting rural and suburban areas, where his messages on law and order resonate strongly."
Poor people with low... Because you worked at Fox.
"On Wednesday, the largest crowd of the campaign showed up in Detroit, Michigan."
Support from labor unions and participation from the bottom up are both very important.
"On the other hand, Harris is focusing on expanding healthcare access, addressing climate change, and promoting social justice to energize urban voters with younger demographics, and the state's growing minority populations."
" Now we've got the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro."
"Because the extreme right wing has taken over the Republican party of Arizona, including the Republican party chair in that state, Trump loyalist Kelly Ward."
"Whether it's the industrial economy, health care access, or social issues, the concerns of voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio will be at the forefront of the national political conversation."
I didn't even know Pitts on a football team.
"They're down 300,000 voter registrations and they're down 460,000 mail-in ballot requests."
Trump's campaign instead pointing to a three paragraph letter his personal doctor released nearly a year ago and tonight saying it's Harris who should pass a test on cognitive stamina on the campaign trail.
"I said, Gina, are we going to win?"
"Hey, Sean Hannity here."
But they may have spent enough money that they will have pushed this kind of anti-union lawyer and corporate lawyer over over the finish line.
That's where all of the streams will take place.
"And one that a lot of political pros will tell you, if people are undecided, announced that they're undecided at this stage of the race, it means they probably aren't that connected to politics and aren't gonna vote."
My wife and I had returned from attending our church meetings.
Look for Battleground Live.
"Hello, everyone."
She would never have won the nomination.
"I remember after the home mortgage crisis, Kamala pushed me and my administration harder than any other Attorney General in the country, to make sure homeowners got a fair settlement."
This is a ridiculous story that will become very dangerous in the long run.
So it's a lot to keep an eye on.
Get your little butt over here.
When was the last time you would have eaten?
"Trump is doubling down on his appeal to the state's industrial workers and rural communities, emphasizing his commitments to job creation and energy independence."
They're certainly not sending him down to Georgia.
But do you find it just a little bit odd that it's every poll finding the shift every single one?
So I'm kind of on both ends right now.
And Michigan was really important to Joe Biden's victory in 2020.
Love for country is evident here along with strong divide over what that means.
I think maybe she should be partaking in lithium because Donald Trump should be forced to live on an island with all these people.
"Use it, please."
"I'm not even going to get into the cool hat you have in the jacket right now, but we are going to talk when you're back in the studio."
I'm non-binary.
"The joy that you're bringing back to the country, the enthusiasm that's out there, it would be a privilege to take this with you across the country."
"Rachel, thank you for joining us as you just heard there."
"I mean, I've won the state of Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, generally the Dakotas, the Prairie areas, they don't have a chance to hell."
Next thing he grabbed he grabbed the back of his head and falls to the ground.
"He has to win Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania."
Trump is at 52 percent.
It's what?
"So for those watching right now to help elevate this content and, and make sure that other people who might be more inclined to vote for Republicans can see this kind of stuff and, and, and have it impact them in the way that it's impacted so many people who've watched their videos before, please make sure to subscribe."
You have to be able to fill them and we seem to fill them very fast.
That's something I'm trying to do as well.
Now you have to shake a stick to find a Republican.
"On immigration, why do you support Kamala Harris?"
It's been trending more and more blue.
"One of them though is perhaps more important than the rest, both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in Pennsylvania yesterday."
Maybe next time we'll have a race between Nikki Haley and uncommitted.
Get vaccinated.
Those are some strong words.
And what the next 50 some odd days will do is allow her to get out on the campaign trail and share those priorities directly with the American people.
"You need something to give them a permission structure to know that like, even if you voted for Republicans your entire life, that it's okay."
Is she Elizabeth Taylor?
"Finish your audit, release the report and be prepared to defend it in court."
It's been four years It's been it's been how I mean nothing everything needs to come back come down to a new level like come back Pre-covid to a more affordable.
Here's a live look from the Kamala Harris rally in Las Vegas.
"You have a very, very high working class population."
"If you want to sign up for the website, it is 16 cents a day."
But it is a response to concerns that have been raised largely over an issue in Alabama that has subsequently been resolved there too.
All right Selena Wang thank you for joining us this evening.
"And thus, we will start with Kamala Harris's potential states, beginning west in Oregon."
"Both candidates, both Dave McCormick and Bob Casey, just slugging away at each other."
"Well, this was the great question when Kamala Harris was making her VP selection, who should she select?"
We're not derogatory.
Robert O'Brien is the one that I think really led the charge.
"Therefore, when Democratic candidate Kamala Harris promotes her economic agenda, she heads to Pittsburgh, the industrial heart of Pennsylvania."
"So if there's a event that you view as very threatening, say you think that the other political candidate is going to destroy your way of life."
"She embraces the successes of the Biden administration, particularly on affordable health care and economic opportunity."
"I mean, give them the opportunity, more opportunities."
Mm-hmm.
Do they have the money to put food on the table?
Donald Trump's plan is simple.
"Because she traveled with the president to the debate, as well as on September 11."
"Gosh, we're all Republicans."
So I only recently did my last video on the Keystone State a little over a week ago.
What do you think about this?
Like me personally like of what I like been through it like in life Like we we've been through it.
"Kamala Harris faces an uphill battle, but she is a formidable candidate with a compelling message that resonates with many."
So Trump is doing five to seven points better than he was doing in Pennsylvania polling four years ago.
"I mean, for a long time, a lot of political reporters and myself included, analysts and such, were saying that, you know, women running away from Trump, it's really going to help Harris."
People who are not very invested in the election will tend to follow somebody that they trust.
I don't think that's a good course for them.
There are never results on election night that are official.
"So we have something of a general consensus here hovering around zero with a few outliers to deal with, starting with the two massive swings in favor of Trump, Franklin and Marshall and Susquehanna."
Immigration has scared me.
And I know that seems very obvious.
Unusual.
"Joining me now, CNN legal analyst and Republican election lawyer, Ben Ginsberg."
" Well, hello Arizona."
"Congressman, part of the surge in Democratic enthusiasm once President Biden dropped out of this race was this idea that the race would become less a referendum on Biden, more of a referendum on Trump."
Thank you guys for watching.
The reason being is there is a bunch of ancestral Democrats in Pennsylvania.
"By winning, she means they would have stopped the certification of the election."
"As we consider it, what Joe was talking about, this notion that we're seeing changes in the way voters feel about the economy or how the economy would fare under these candidates and Harris more favorably."
"And at the same time, on some of these, we had a daughter who was gravely ill, who was upset by what was happening outside and my wife, that was a valiant person, very strong, quiet, very strong woman."
That's less than 2022.
"And in fact, I spoke with a wife whose husband, a Pennsylvania truck driver, did not vote in 2020 because he was working."
And not just Harris plus one.
"And you had this huge number of Republicans like Cindy McCain, the widow of the late Senator John McCain, all the way to former Senator Jeff Flake, you know, all of them coming out and saying, hey, I'm still a Republican."
And that's why we're getting out there and making Donald Trump the next president of the United States.
"So why she wasn't there, there were some awesome folks who were there to really, you know, stand up and say, look, we're supporting the Kamala Harris wall ticket."
"I mean, as being just a real estate investor and being somebody who's in real estate, that's going to really, it's going to cause, it could possibly cause another crash."
They've really believed that they're going to actually all show up on Election Day.
Maybe that's boosted his support a little bit in Pennsylvania by a couple points without Joe Biden on the ballot.
But that's like sinking.
"You got Romney, Liz Cheney."
"If you just want to take a look at Donald Trump's performance in a number of these counties, Donald Trump is significantly underperforming as well in Pennsylvania."
"No, at best you could argue it looks like a 50-50 race."
Is that what she does every day for a living?
"I mean, if you're on his campaign, and I know you are certainly not, I'm not making any implication of that, but what is the logic behind this going to a McDonald's?"
You think literal tapes.
And I couldn't see the methodology of Rasmussen in terms of the demographics of what they polled in the Rasmussen poll either.
Whereas the Trump campaign is really focused on increasing turnout in rural communities around the state.
He picked Al Gore.
"So I have to get y else you want to say to t are on the fence that ar on CNN and mainstream mea So when you hear he's a r know all the bad things, and you'll find out the t you so excited?"
"I know they're lowering student loan debt I'm happy about that it benefits me first My sister got her loans forgiven I was really excited about that thank you Mr. Biden But what did the Democrats have planned for us especially as black folks Besides putting somebody who's one eighth African in the office and claiming that we have a black president again Who's married to a white man a Jewish white man Which is also in the middle of this Palestine Gaza versus Israel conflict Having a Jewish person in the White House with one heartbeat from the presidency or even a spouse I don't think we should criticize it but some are going to look at it as choosing a side And I know Donald Trump has Jewish family so maybe that's a negative but Right now I just want to beat Donald Trump I don't ever want to live under that clown again And I have the fear that should he take office he will never leave office again That's my fear so I've asked I begged and I encourage you all to go pursue an open and honest process for this de facto democratic primary If no one steps up and challenges her Hey, the Democrats have made their bed."
"So Republican voters are going to be the one deciding and among Republican voters in Arizona who I talked to, Donald Trump remains a popular figure here."
They're going to help get him across the goal line.
"The thing about, even though there are some Republicans in leadership who are saying that this clearly wasn't a winning strategy, none of them are saying that they won't support Trump if he's a nominee again in 2024."
I think Oz is slightly better.
"Well two things first is we are flooded with disinformation like never before and I think it's imperative for everybody Penn students especially to To guard against being swept away by lies and stuff that is just meant to sort of pollute the atmosphere pollute the media ecosystem and You know look at the fact-checking websites for which there are three or four including factcheck.org here at Penn and PolitiFact Dot-com is another one, but that's one of the things that everybody needs to guard against to be good citizens But the second thing is that there is still time if you haven't done it to register to vote in Pennsylvania as opposed to where your parents live For example, this is just as we started this conversation."
"Kadyrov plans to deploy the Cybertruck in the Russian-Ukraine war, praising Musk as a modern genius and inviting him to visit Chechnya."
Why do you think this is?
"When Biden would go on, he used to go on say we will stop Magga."
"All of that is part of a western Pennsylvania strategy, not only to make that state more winnable, but also make your outreach more persuasive, possibly, in Wisconsin and Michigan."
"And in 2020, Joe Biden lost it by 2.3%."
"And Dan, what does that rally tell you about where Democrats and their candidates are today versus where they were just three months, three weeks and a day ago before Joe Biden stepped aside?"
It took me five days to raise two million.
You've got a good breakfast here in front of you I think some French toast and some bacon.
"So could I ask you then, then, why is Donald Trump in Georgia?"
What do you say to that?
So it's definitely hitting young families hard.
Not Nevada.
It's over for Harris.
The people aren't letting her get away with it.
I highly recommend just taking a look at the site regardless.
"She talked around it, and I want a more direct answer."
"She is now helping very much, Kevin McCarthy, who wants to be speaker, helping him try to get the votes."
PC for life.
"That's the scene in Butler County, Pennsylvania where there was to be a marathon rally of former President Trump that only got five minutes in before this incident occurred."
I am here to tell you that is not what real strength is.
So this Pennsylvania stuff is really the big stuff.
"You want to, I think it would, I think it would fundamentally, I mean, you want to talk about what would be something that would make the world burn last minute."
What do I mean by this?
"In contrast, Harris and the Democrats have advocated for a transition to renewable energy, which has been met with some resistance from voters who fear job losses in the energy sector."
They feel like that was the key part of his success here in the Keystone State in 2016 and it's something they want to be able to replicate this time.
"By the way, it was the single best decision I made as president of the United States of America."
"According to our polling, black voters overall are supporting Harris at the same rate as they did for Biden in 2020, but the likelihood of turnout lags than that of white voters."
"She has no policies and she's full of word salad If Kamala Harris were elected president, she'd be the first female president You're obviously a woman would send mean anything to you the final so-called glass ceiling."
The implications of this ruling are manifold.
There was also two other victims who were shot but have been recovering from their wounds.
Every vote counts.
Kisses.
So this is a key state for Donald Trump to win.
We ought to really think about it because that just means the government's case is getting stronger and stronger.
And that's going to do it for the Morning Agenda.
That's what it comes down to.
Some of that money actually is a point in China.
"You know, they, they, they should just have Harris winning honestly."
2020 changed our elections probably for good.
"And I'm very proud to say that two counties in particular that we've been working on, Pike and Wayne counties in Northeast Pennsylvania, they are the top two most producing Republican counties per registered Republican that have requested more mail-in ballots than the Democrats."
It makes you wonder.

"There were some medical incidents, two people for one and then another collapse were being treated."
Now this is both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris's 10th visit to Pennsylvania since Harris entered the race showing just how important this state is to both of them.
This is a really remarkable turnaround from where Biden was.
He lost the election and he shouldn't be in the White House.
"And Donald Trump does have this branding that has worked well for him of this businessman, this successful businessman persona that can run this country like a business."
Here we go.
I again have been told I don't know if it's right.
I'm so cheer-girl.
I'll bet that's it.
I've never ever ever ever ever been asked for any Politician could you get tickets to go and see them?
And I think that gets it exactly backwards.
"Yeah, they were off by three to five points in the middle of October."
"Every time since 2016, Donald Trump, or one of his political offspring, have been on the ballot."
Who know what real strength looks like?
"Yeah, they don't and here's the reason they don't want Let's say you're a Democrat."
This is a big one.
"Well, I hate to be so crass, but the interview was a train wreck."
"Good job, Grandma."
And they mean business.
We should be in good shape.
That's the way I poll.
Tells a different story.
"One of the conversations surrounding this is about how people are just like black people specifically are having the conversation of how they are happy that the person, the shooter is not a black person because we wouldn't have been able to hear the end of it if we happen to be a black person."
Biggest people in the administration.
"There are several things working against Kamala Harris We'll get right to the point The first thing that we wanna discuss is her ethnicity A man wheeled out in Aruba T'Lutha Bryan, who said she's going to win I like the positivity But her ethnicity is a problem, demographically And I'll explain myself, please Don't jump down my grill, just bear with me I say this with no malice But she is a immigrant child Not an ADOS person, not an FDA person Point one, point two She comes from a biracial Jamaican father She comes from a Brahmin Indian family Both of those aspects The woman has about 1 eighth African in her That we know of About 1 eighth So the pretense that this is a black woman in the regards of a traditional African black woman Here in America is not true And they're gonna try to sell her as a black president The same way Obama was sold as a black president, except Obama was half African Again, not a descendant of slaves like some of us But he married into the family Kamala chose to marry Doug, who is a white Jewish man So she already has this exotic background And then she adds to it a white Jewish man Now, I grew up in Pennsylvania And obviously Pennsylvania has a Jewish president, Josh Shapiro So Pennsylvania is not really all that biased against Shapiro or Jewish people in particular But in central Pennsylvania, between Philly and Pittsburgh, where I grew up It might as well be Alabama, Salute to Harrisburg, Harrisburg City as well But it might as well be Alabama, where I grew up And I grew up in what was solid blue democratic territory Looks like the music's a little bit louder, but I'm gonna bring the music down just a little bit Pardon me for a second while I do that But I grew up in that solid blue democratic territory led by Congressman Jack Mirtha Who I watched put on black men from my hometown In the late 70s, as I was a kid, and things were changing in America We started seeing brothers get executive positions in my hometown Salute to Kelly Washington, his family, Vanessa, P, all them But his family was benefited My family was benefited I can honestly say that my father got his job largely because of affirmative action Now, I know how that sounds in 2024 But when you grow up in a town like I did, you had to force white people to have at least one employee on site You had to force them They literally would not hire black people Crump from, so we're talking about Pennsylvania We ain't talking about Alabama, but I'm telling you between Pittsburgh and Philly, it might as well be So that's the environment I grew up in With this movement out of the the civil rights movement And people like my father coming back from Vietnam, they got theirs, right?"
"And unlike you Kamala, I know who my roots are."
Let's continue our coverage with CBS Philadelphia's Josh Sanders.
So they're asking for rolling back of things that the voters themselves are starting to approve of and enjoy.
"As the first female vice president, the first black vice president, and the first Asian-American vice president, she embodies the changing face of American leadership."
So there's a conflict between this big and important industry of extracting oil and natural gas from the ground and the Harris-Biden administration.
Seems like the third party candidates are going to be on the ballot in a lot of these swing states where they can kind of play spoiler.
Early voting is underway in a dozen states.
Even Elon Musk.
I think there's a lot of talk on the right about the left being very woke and you know I think it's definitely true for some people but a lot of us are just kind of trying to prioritize human rights and trying to make sure that we have respect for others and I think that a lot of what you see that seems very extreme on the left is not representative of all of us.
I should knock on wood and hope I don't have to add a third episode this morning.
"Our top story tonight involves Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has made waves with his latest remarks on Vice President Kamala Harris."
If Trump is still up by like three to four points in Pennsylvania.
It's called Trumpy Trout.
And she's resettled them into your communities to prey upon innocent American people.
So there's more to it than what he says.
"But as of now, it's only 1.3 million requests."
They have Donald Trump in the lead Atlas Intel.
"Well, effectively, there's a bunch of Democrats in deep red counties like Butler, Westmoreland, Washington, you know, the western part of the state in particular, where they've been voting Republican for like 20 years now, but they still register as Democrats."
"She's saying, look, I am looking out specifically for you."
He saved me.
"Good morning, Vlad."
That's the name of the video.
I love to see it.
"He, you know, was Trump's doctor, the TV doctor back in 2016 who gave him his physical and said that, oh he could lose a couple pounds."
They wounded themselves.
Another cadence besides male or female.
"But you need to have those conversations, though."
"In an interview today, Vice President Harris said this."
"And so there are a lot of us who realize that we can contain the multitudes, that it's country over party."
"And so it's so, so, so incredibly fascinating that we are at this point, where we come out from an election, where Donald Trump should have been raising, you know, a lot of money, the conviction helps him raise more money that he could use in battleground states, yada, yada, yada, yada, the assassination attempt, again, the RNC, JD Vance, all of these things that should in theory, should in theory have helped Donald Trump as a candidate, and then Joe Biden drops out of the race."
"The VPs visit here, leaving a lasting impact."
He's probably winning Nevada.
" Speaking of Donald Trump, take a look at this moment from yesterday at a grocery store in Pennsylvania."
And it's just one poll.
"Because at the end of the day, they need her for their own political benefits."
"You really have to hold up your margins everywhere, and that's what we're here to do."
It's beautiful.
"Look, I think he brings the fact that he has served our country in the military, the fact that he is someone who's worked his way through life from a working class family."
" This is encouraging, you know, it's rhetoric."
We still have one more lean state remaining too.
There's no denying that there's a new momentum.
So I think Kamala Harris needs to deliver that message to the American people and deliver that message to young voters.
"Come to think of it, there's a few other people I'd like to send right down to the prison down here in Florence."
Let me hear what you guys think.
You want to take a look at Erie County.
So it has made it ground zero For these two candidates and it's like they say that no matter who loses Pennsylvania that candidate has much less of a chance of prevailing nationally Wow In 2016 you wrote that quote Trump's dissing of democracy will live in infamy and that he was a clear and present Danger to our Democratic values What specifically did you observe about Trump eight years ago that led you to make his claim far before January 6th?
"But you know, it is one of those statements."
The Daily Mail came out with some reporting today based on different modeling that they had that said that Trump was ahead by almost 10 points at the electoral college.
"The Harris campaign has added an issues tab on the campaign website, but I wonder what you think about this perception from voters."
Clinton just outright lost it.
How does she ensure that she wins Pennsylvania?
"So, fellas, you stay up here, just look at this one tape and then you go back and enjoy it."
You have the crowd cheering and screaming.
"Asking black men to accept the entry of women, particularly women of color, in corridors of power Barack Obama's words managed to touch a raw nerve."
"If you're a Democratic voter, you're in a lot of the same places."
You see.
"Okay, we don't have time for that."
"They said, all gloves are off."
"Can't do that yet, even though they're trying hard to do that."
Millions and millions of people.
"Kamala Harris will be looking to do really well in not just Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and their suburbs, but also in some of the smaller cities."
This doesn't happen all the time in Amish country.
"Now, you mentioned that this poll doesn't bring a lot of clarity."
And so that also continues to reaffirm that Kamala Harris is in fact in the lead in Pennsylvania.
"Meanwhile, this weekend is a huge sports weekend with WrestleMania 40 and the Final Four."
"When you buy a razor at Henson Shaving dot com slash pacman, use the code pacman to get a two year supply of blades for free."
Also this custom cowboy hat.
And so I don't even mention his name.
"Some people think that it may be, at this moment, the most important battleground state for Vice President Harris to try to win if she wants to be president."
"I mean, I grew up like listening to hip-hop."
"Mick, it is always a pleasure."
There would be quite the symbolic nature of them winning versus Trump.
You spoke at the Democratic National Convention.
Vance would not even be a senator today and certainly not on the vice presidential ticket.
"And then they talk about the Vice President nominee, J.D."
Let's take a look at the next clip.
They gathered a group of Latinos to talk about those issues.
"Well, I think it signifies, number one, that the Harris campaign recognizes the importance of this demographic."
"But Kamala Harris as the opposition to Joe Biden, not opposition, but the alternative to Joe Biden does far better."
This is coming from someone that covers the Harris campaign for NBC News.
They don't want to be held back.
He doesn't give a rat's ass about you and your grocery bill.
This is compliments of Trump.
So we've seen this kind of thing going on with the campaign for a while.
And here's where I believe things are going on.
It's a state that's definitely in play.
How is Harris getting ready for this?
Make sure to add the blades to your cart.
They should have been able to get it done.
"Should she not have, Minnesota very likely would have become a tilt state supporting either Harris or even Trump."
Nobody is fighting harder for America than Donald Trump.
"This ruling is seen as a major win for Trump and the Republican Party, and it reinforces their stance on maintaining stringent measures for ensuring election integrity."
And that was the final one before the election ended up being 1.2 percentage points.
Absolutely unbelievable to me.
"I guess that's a possibility, but I highly doubt that's going to happen."
"We know, you know, one thing I was just reading that the Latino vote, which I'm always following so closely, is really favoring Ron DeSantis."
He's talking about this.
"He said and I think as we get closer people get more tense, you know, they're even more vocal."
And tomorrow will be another one.
"With polls showing a dead heat between Harris and Trump, both campaigns will likely invest heavily in the state, focusing on turning out their base while appealing to undecided and swing voters."
And now she's the candidate and she's doing really well.
Two years on.

D plus three back then.
"And she also, I thought, made a really important point for all of Donald Trump's bluster about energy."
" Alright, so looks like we got some absolutely huge news coming out of the state of Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris."
This was would be my demographical prediction.
"The closer it gets to election day, the closer this race gets."
"Bing, bing, bong, bong, bing, bing, bing, bing."
"But really quickly, I have to tell you guys about shop.readegalpolitics.com, because the 2024 election merchandise drop is here."
We've still got the vice presidential debate.

"So Erie is was the home forever in a day of the New Deal, the coalition of Democrats."
"John Ribel, you're doing a live video after the VP debate."

"And as you could see from the Dominion voting machines lawsuit, the sort of patience some people have for this kind of behavior is worn really thin."
I can't see anybody else.

Camilla.

What does she think she's like Trump or something.
Not Biden.
This is the first time it's a pilot program that all these influencers like yourself have been credentialed.
"You have made false claims about some of your rivals from Nikki Haley to former President Barack Obama, saying they weren't born in the United States, which is not true."
"I'm like, I can't even do this."
"So I think that, of course, the Republican leaders are gonna be asked about it."

"Si se puede, just remember to bring your photo ID."
"You know, I've never been the biggest fan of Donald Trump."
What smaller packages do you offer?
11.
Don't just open up the RNC for serious funding.
This reflects the polarized nature of the debate in the state.
Democrats came out to vote for President Biden.
And that's more because Minnesota Democrats actually had unified control of state government for the last after the twenty two midterms when they gained control of the state Senate.
Maybe we got a little bit more a few more suburban white women this time.

It's not like he's leading it just in Trafalgar or Rasmussen or like insider advantage with some right leading pollster that ended up being wrong in 2022.
And you know the party has been shifting in this popular populist direction.
I think it's looking like this will come down to which campaign can get out their base more than the other one.
So what do you make of that description?
"In order to pursue a more divisive and Trump-centric agenda, he made the claim that Republicans were putting the problems that are most important to families on the backburner."
"Meanwhile, Trump's rallies in the state have continued to draw large crowds, maintaining his base's enthusiasm."
And black turnout is poised to probably dip a little bit.
"Okay, that's still not enough because she wins Wisconsin and Michigan."

It will liberate.

Kamala is a Californian first And that can be somewhat of an issue for a national politician at this point Um..."
The narrowing gap suggests that even some of his most loyal supporters are reconsidering their options.
"Donald Trump is at 50% in the battleground states, Harris is at 48%."

The potential impacts of Harris's campaign in Pennsylvania extend beyond the immediate electoral outcome.
"And it came across as though labor was behind her, right?"
"You can make that argument, obviously."
I Hope so.
We've talked about how important that voting bloc is.
"But right here, in a close election, that's very important."
I'm from there.
And that absolutely is not true.
How would turnout differ?
And I think that's what we're seeing Vice President Harris do.
There's also a lot of nerves about Pennsylvania.
"I mean, clearly, nobody wants to see any of these people hurt."
But what about turnout?
You've said there's a huge amount of people in the middle that can be influenced by the extremes.
"We really haven't hit the campaign strides and Donald Trump has gone up in the polls despite being on trial too, which is something that needs to be taken into account."
"And I guess I don't think we'll know the answer until election night, really."
"Although he leads by zero point three in the polling average, this won't stop me."
Trump plus two.

"Until 1926, the last state to remove non-citizens from voting was Arkansas in the Deep South."

"Industries like coal mining, steel production and agriculture remain important in the local economy and policies protecting local jobs from the impacts of globalization are core factors in attracting the support of this group."
The hears his campaign is calling Trump's positions unpopular and damaging.
I believe that he has not gotten the full credit for the accomplishments he's done in office.
"The polling data showing Trump with a six-point lead over Harris in 2024 suggests that Ohio may be leaning more solidly Republican, at least in presidential elections."
The path to victory is through Pennsylvania.
And not her.
How are you the most unpopular vice president in the history of the United States when it comes to polling?
It only costs us 500 grand.
"After all, she lost it totally at last."
But Shapiro signs shells to be used in the war in Ukraine.
"I want to pull on a thought you just mentioned, because this has been something I've been thinking about a lot, too, is when you are echoing dictators, when you're trying to crush the media, when you are trying to silence people out there, make it harder to vote, that's not a sign of strength."

All 86 pages.
"We win, Pennsylvania We win the whole yes in a town hall style event in the western suburbs of Philadelphia The former president stuck to his top issues attacking Vice President Harris over inflation and immigration He pledged to shut the southern border and Russia's war in Ukraine lower prices at the grocery store and bring down interest rates to 2% while providing few details on how he'd accomplish all that people don't think of grocery You know it sounds like not such an important word when you talk about homes and everything else, right?"
I just don't feel like doing it right now.
Give this a watch.
"So Raymond, I really appreciate this."
"I don't know if it's coordinated or not, but they randomly are coming in the same way that they did at the end of twenty twenty two."

"Now, why is it that this is very good news for Kamala Harris in the final days leading up to what will be the most consequential, the most important state for either candidate to have a smooth sailing path to victory on election night?"
"And in that interview, she accused the former president of demeaning the office of the presidency and essentially arguing that he lacks the basic temperament involved for the job."
What about him?
All of those were states that she stopped in last week on her battleground tour with Governor Tim Walz.
"I mean, you're looking, you've seen an Atlas Intel."
"He was kind of excusing the companies, I guess, either directly or indirectly, excusing companies for engaging in price coaching like it's, you know, it's OK to to gouge someone."
But she wants just factual information.
So the challenge here and the goal for Harris is to make sure that black men end up turning out.
Pretty disgusted.
And there was clear instances of cheating.
"You know, they considered bad treatment when you're not allowed to do your job."
But I just want to start with the vice president's remarks.

All of these locations are in Pennsylvania.

The thing is that it's really gonna matter everyone's vote.
Better.
Don't believe it.
Republican strategist Samuel Chen of the Little Group previously worked for people such as former Pennsylvania Republican U.S.
I don't have any details on the shooter just yet.

"So Trump definitely has a unique point of strength there I want to talk about why Pennsylvania is the most important state in the election Which is why we're going to be talking about it so much It's because if you give everybody all their states that they won not in 2020 But like and these doesn't mean safe states just because they're in the deepest color But it's just states that are not considered to be the seven big competitive swing states So if you give each candidate their safer states, let's just say well Kamala Harris, let's just give Trump, North Carolina, right?"
50 bucks.
"It was the original terms of the original debate going back about two months now, and the Trump team wants it to continue."
Free enterprise.
"Well, yeah, I mean, inflation has been brutal."
That's why we're here.
"If you haven't subscribed, please hit that subscribe button."
That's a pretty easy job.
That's also true.
What is the Trump rationale here?
Vance type when it comes to trade policy farm policy and populist economics.
"It's not that they were in deficit mode, I just want more."
That rule applies to state officials when they're running for federal office.
Pretty good.
Before Joe Biden in 2020 pushed them hard to the left by more than 7 points each.
But this question is important because...
Also there are just so many more people.
No doubt about that.
"I think when we start getting into conversations that deal with oppressing particular populations, rescinding rights, trying to remove the very existence of some people from our conversations to our history books, to our laws."
"The New York Post reporting that Democrats in Pennsylvania, that all-important state, say that Harris is, quote, AWOL in being out message."
"Actually, he I had hosted him on May 1st and he had whispered something to my family on the night of the debate."
I gave her an A.
That Republicans are saying that that is not our party.
"And so this has been a very troubling, sort of a troubling pattern that I think the relationship between kind of politics and extremism seems to have gotten stronger since January 6th, not weaker."
"Ask the question and you know, that's the question."
The protests were mostly peaceful.
"Yeah, without question."
It's fantastic.
The event energized his base and put a spotlight on the issues that are animating voters in this critical swing state.
I'm joined now by former acting U.S. Lister General Neil Koch.
And apparently he is going to round up undocumented immigrants in the country as well.
"And when you take a look at the numbers on 538, which is also quite accurate, you can see that where we are right now for the 2024 election in the general in Pennsylvania, Democrats do pull out the overall advantage ahead."
"Folks, over the past three years I've had the privilege of traveling all across this great nation."
How does Pennsylvania stand up today?
I think the last time we pulled there was like Trump was up by like 4.4% and I think the margin of error was like somewhere down like 3% or something.
"This is about Republicans looking forward and saying, you know, in the next time, can they sow that kind of doubt and maybe just turn a few people's votes, a few key people, and then hand the election to the Republicans even though they wouldn't have won it in a democracy?"
And what did they find?
"If there's an encouraging signal from all of this for crypto, it's that Bitcoin won't fall much more."
So that's how Donald Trump spending his time.
Voters will decide what the best direction is for the future of the country.
Both campaigns know that winning here could mean winning at all.
"Okay, that's a possibility."
It's like Trump's leading Wisconsin by 0.4.
Their average member is in their early 30s.
"At that same meeting held indoors at a Phoenix church, the Arizona GOP voted to reelect party chair Kelly Ward."
Like what I want it to look like.
"Now, we have some very, very good people here."
We saw him kind of live there in 2020.
It was the fact that 80000 voters went out and skipped the presidential question in total.
So you know how it worked.
And I think you're going to see Kamala Harris do incredibly well in the city and boost turnout in the city.
She's gone to the border for years.
"Hey, Natasha, good evening."
"The fifth poll was conducted by TIPP Insights between October 7 and 9 among 1,079 registered voters."
What issues matter most to them?
"On immigration, Harris has called for comprehensive reform that provides a clear pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants."
Texans know voting fraud occurred in some of their counties.
"And they had an interesting theory as to why Trump said the weird thing about how he's more attractive, right?"
"When Biden was on the ticket, I was going to vote for Trump."
"This isn't the first time Musk's inventions have found their way into the conflict, with Starlink also being used by both sides."
And we have other polling out of other swing states.
You can always tweak it as you go down the road.
"Now, Pennsylvania, I think is going to be a very closed state."
Let's head out West.
"We'll see, but his lead actually expands when you look at it."
I'm sound like how.
We've seen what he will sign.
We have the lowest unemployment rate in the country.
"I mean, they're going to try."
And she wasn't stopping there.
"And do you that you want to tell the Yes, we need more help in to go next week myself wi we weren't hurt on the ot got a lot of organizations Hawke Kites is out there, all I can say is people r down there."
"However, Harris faces challenges in rural and traditional industrial areas, where her green energy policies may raise concerns about job losses."
"Just like she never said in 2020, oh, I changed my position on fracking."
"Meanwhile, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigned in battleground states with the Republican in Michigan as the Democrat visited Arizona."
"He's actually winning despite Suffolk pushing garbage pull-out that had Harris up by three, which compared to everyone else is an outlier."
And it make it all the more embarrassing to Oz that he couldn't beat the guy that they describe as a mentally retarded person.
You scroll down here.
"Jen Fifield, reporter for the Arizona Republic, doing some intrepid work today in a really strange environment, operating with really strange constraints, but reporting out something that was of huge importance about what you viewed today, despite the narrow lens you were given to look through."
"Except for one poll, he's at 48, 49, and 50% of the vote."
"If you're just joining me, President Trump, the 45th President of the United States has been shot at a rally."
I don't believe that.
"When you asked him for evidence of the struggle, what did he say?"
Certainly that's what the Biden campaign hopes will do or at least drive voters to do exactly what you just described.
Even Harris plus five.
"Number one, when the government prints trillions of dollars, that makes the dollars that we all have less worth it, right?"
They went viral for a reason.
"Democrats and Harris are still saying, look, we're going to pay for some of this new spending with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, but not doing a lot to bring down overall spending."
We'll sleep when we're dead.
"Hey, well, I got one more question for you, Alex, before you go."
A lot of that's really stupid tax policy.
He is better at that stuff.
"They would say, oh, there's going to be a bump."
That's going to be her response.
"It's like bamboo ballots all over again, right?"
"The election would be entirely different if MSNBC reported just like CNN, which is an incredibly low bar because CNN is very fake news, as we all know."
And that's the difference.
"Good morning, Terry Good morning, George Donald Trump came here to the suburbs of Philadelphia one of the critical battlegrounds in this battleground state looking for votes But as you say that town hall event that he held quickly turned into something very different when the candidate turned into a DJ a overnight Donald Trump in his 11th trip to must win, Pennsylvania Urged his supporters to turn out on election day."
It's that way in Virginia.
"The early voting trends suggest that many Pennsylvanians are already casting their votes based on these issues, and the Democrats' dominance in early voting is a direct reflection of this shift in the electorate."
And it makes the stakes of the November election so much more critical.
How is the Harris campaign kind of working to close the gap on some of these key issues?
"When you do that, we'll teach Donald Trump and extreme migrant Republicans a valuable lesson."
They are blaming Biden for this.
"And Pennsylvania, again, doesn't stand alone in this characterization."
"Now Arizona, on the other hand, has trended almost 9 points to the left since 2012, when Romney carried it by 10 points over Obama."
"I mean, this is a huge shift we're seeing."
"And these are the counties that are in southeastern Pennsylvania, right outside of Philadelphia."
And a significant number of Republicans in the state believe there was something wrong with the election.
"He's you know, retweeted things that were relatively pro-BLM and McCormick has done the same thing."
But it's also about what happened down at his golf course on September 15th.
So those were already drilled.
"He's flipping counties and you've got Democrats, you know, signing artillery shells to be used as an escalation force to trend to World War Three."
"Yeah, those are Pennsylvania Senate candidates, John Federman and Dr. Mehmet Oz."
"Vice President Harris is set to speak in Erie tonight, while former President Trump is holding a town hall in a suburb of Philadelphia."
"And you, a Democrat, Tim Ryan, are not there."
That I think would be the easiest way to victory.
"But the fact that this number of people is willing to do it and to go is a reminder that if you haven't signed up to phone bank at minimum for Pennsylvania, now would be a really good time."
The upcoming debates between Harris and Trump are highly anticipated and could be pivotal in swaying undecided voters.
Trump is down to 47.7.
"Now, understand a tariff is any imported good."
"Despite Trump's edge on economic issues, Harris is seen as having strong moral character and mental sharpness, which could sway undecided voters."
Are you going to accept these results?
"It's an example of how at the end of the day, this election, it's not just about policies."
"But secondly, look at the percentage like Republicans went down roughly 12 to 15% or whatever it was Democrats went down 20 to 25%."
"As he says this in Western Pennsylvania, you're going to be able to feel united as opposed to constantly feeling divided."
"Yes, he has to go on offense technically because he's flipping these states."
"And listen, I'm sure there's some things that we would disagree on policy wise."
So I'm not voting for the bully.
"Donald Trump's presidency, in hindsight, do you approve or disapprove of how he did as president?"
"Made you stop the traditional reporting in a nonpartisan manner and sort of turned towards opinion Oh, yeah, that's a good question."
I'm trying really hard to figure out a way to bring Hawaii into a battleground state.
 Anybody who's about beating down other people is a coward!
"Yeah, you know, there are some pollsters, I think, who under represent Republicans."
You see that behind me.
"Von, we also saw Arizona Speaker of the House Rusty Bowers lose his bid for a state Senate seat to David Farnsworth, who supported Trump's claims that the 2020 election was stolen."
"But yeah, both sides are really just coming in hot with the personal attacks and policy seems to be a distant second here."
And I want to play that part for our audience.
"And we've actually been really getting bombarded with like a lot of low quality polls, which we're going to get through as well."
It looks like somebody missed they shot and maybe grazed them and let me tell you what's gonna happen over the next couple days.
They genuinely believe this.
"The polls in October in Pennsylvania, they sucked both in 2020 and 2016."
"In Michigan, Harris receiving 50% of support among likely voters with Trump at 45%."
The back and forth over medical records is ramping up again.
"They wanted to show in big bold letters, how many, or big board, bold numbers, how many people Trump was killing like per minute."
How do you then expand that messaging in order to attract more of those independent voters?
"And it's a huge one that she has a difference from Joe Biden, who really, frankly, was uncomfortable talking about this issue."
Why was the number of undocumented immigrants basically the same when he left office as when he took office?
You've got to uncross those fingers.
Joe Biden delivered funding for that.
Part of a blitz of interviews.
"They say, oh, but covid."
"If that really does happen, it's Harris not going to win Pennsylvania."
That's why it's such a big deal if Pennsylvania goes towards Trump.
I'm feeling good with her.
And we've never had anything like it.
I think between the Dodgers and the Yankees.
"But I just want to tell you, you are phenomenal people."
"Last night, Kamala Harris had a rally at like a preschool gym."
I brought it here to live paint.
"I don't want to say two evils But it's kind of when you have these two selections I think that obviously he has a clear choice of picking trump and he changed his mindset on that originally my family and I we were ben karson fans and uh That kind of when trump got the ticket then that's who our guy was we weren't for biden or Kamala harris, absolutely, sir."
"Anyway, let's talk about, well, Joe Biden being on the campaign trail, what is the point of his presence?"
The idea of running a change campaign without change is kind of nonsensical.
I see one Harris waltz.
"That's why I believe that these voters, they're going to shift heavily towards Trump or they just may not vote."
Let P equals 52.
Are you cooking also?
"She can sell herself to voters there, given her record on energy and some other issues as well."
"You know, across the board, carried Bernie Moreno to a much larger than expected victory."
And Trump was Trump shows up.
I just love teachers.
"Well, look, as a former prosecutor, I know an easy mark when I see one."
Pennsylvania is one that she needs.
She sent it to some of the state party leaders and it's pretty scathing.
Like it makes no sense.
Am I saying Trump's going to win it by 21 points?
"It should really make them think, wow, these candidates are terrible."
"Demanding and saying look it does not require a scientist or a doctor to understand the impacts of lead pipes on the health of our children and the voices of the community must be heard and let us also acknowledge that while lead pipes were once standard in all communities today not all communities are impacted in the same way because of course the folks who have extra resources maybe they have equity in their home and they're a homeowner right maybe they have money in the bank account maybe some savings well then they can pay to replace the lead pipes in their home but people in low-income communities or people who rent often cannot and the president and I understand that this is yes it is an infrastructure matter but it is also a public health matter it is also a public health matter and one of the essential functions of government is to concern itself with the public health which is why President Biden and I decided that we need to address this issue understanding the public health crisis it can create and then making sure that all people have access to what they need to be healthy regardless of how much money they have in their back pocket so we have invested billions of dollars to remove every lead pipe in our nation including right here in Pittsburgh and today I am proud to announce that President Biden and I are dedicating 5.8 billion in federal dollars to help remove lead pipes and to fund clean water projects across our country which includes more than 200 million dollars for Pennsylvania and I will tell you yes and as you heard I was in Pittsburgh not very long ago and when I was last year to speak with members of this community impacted by lead pipes since that has happened or since that meeting we have now made investments that have resulted in this city being able to replace more than three thousand lead pipes to the benefit of more than 10,000 people and you are well on your way to replacing every lead pipe here in the next 24 months so today's additional investment will help accelerate that work and it will also help upgrade other water infrastructure so here's the deal in Pennsylvania many water mains that deliver water to a street or a neighborhood are over 100 years old so old water mains are more likely to break or bust especially when the temperatures drop just a few weeks ago in the hill district a water main burst and hundreds of people lost water for a full day the 200 million dollars now coming to pennsylvania can be used to replace old water mains across the state and also could be used to upgrade storm drains and prevent floods during the heavy rains like the floods that you saw in downtown Pittsburgh just a few weeks ago so when president Biden and I talk about why we do what we do it is to deliver in a way that is about real results for real people it's about understanding the constraints and the burdens that families face that working people face for some basic things like having access to clean water and what we know we can do together to actually fix these long-standing problems and in addition part of the beauty of what we have all done together is these investments will create jobs good paying union jobs jobs for plumbers and pipe fitters and laborers jobs for the workers of plumbers local 27 here in Pittsburgh and it comes down to this in the United States of America every person should be able to have clean water I shouldn't have to say that but it does come down to that every person should have a right and the ability to have access to clean water and it should not matter where you live or how much money you earn or how much money you got in your back pocket and with the help of all of the leaders here we are building a future then where clean water will be a reality for all and I thank you all for the work you do every day may God bless you and may God bless the United States of America thank you"
"Biden, sorry, rather, Trump was up four points against Kamala Harris."
"Look, even on the most contentious issues, I've always said there are good people of conscience on both sides of the abortion divide."
And I grew up in your neck of the woods.
Getting shot almost shot at twice.
"Everyone's assuming there's going to be a debate a week from tomorrow, but it's not a done deal yet."
"Just honestly, do your research."
"No, definitely not."
"However, I have just seen Kamala's report and it's not good."
So that was the first ask that we hold an official committee hearing.
The speech that I'm showing you took place on Friday evening.
What do you mean now is the official calling for this new investigation?
"It's a guy named Kelly, he's a mediocre congressman, and he'll replace Doug Burgum."
"Come on, Kelly."
And that's why these numbers are actually good news for us.
It could be longer.
"But as I close, I want to say this, I don't show up for going to McDonald's and working this shift."
"The polls are obviously moving in Democrats' favor, but we're also seeing it with volunteer signups in places like western Pennsylvania, my congressional district."
And that's what we're seeing.
"But again, there's also a lot of rural voters in Wisconsin."
"And he has quite a, you know, he's a veteran on Capitol Hill."
"But it was interesting, ABC got an interview with him and he also talked about how Trump's words are not helping."
And so they've been talking about us and we decided to talk about them as well.
And it's possible the polls underestimating him.
"And I said, is that Sophia Lauren?"
"But Cornel West now being on the ballot, absolutely huge, huge news."
"And I know Colorado's got a couple good players, but I also know you guys have beaten them twice in a row, so don't bet against the Wildcats tomorrow."
"And that takes into account the past four years of Biden's record, which she's basically tied to with the hip."
And how is each candidate trying to reach those voters?
It all started with a disastrous surrender from Afghanistan.
"Thankfully she can deliver on that excellence, but that means one mistake, one slip up is ten times worse for her than it ever would be for Donald Trump when Donald Trump can't even answer coherently what his childcare policy is."
But there's also another notion that's going on.
As we have been for years and years and years.
Arm yourself with knowledge.
And we'll see those continue as Nathan Wade is answering questions at the house today.
"We were out there, for example, in late June discussing this with waiters and bartenders who said, yeah, on paper, that's a great idea."
"Now, papers do, and you just write on a sheet of paper, concept of a plan."
He cannot lose it.
"Harris voters, more likely than Trump voters to say that the U.S. stock market is higher now."
"Right now Trump's up by, you know, point two percent and that's with an outlier."
Harris now has a five-point lead with that group.
"In the race for the presidency in 2024, both patriotism and bipartisanship will be important."
"Because together, we've got a chance to choose a new generation of leadership in this country, and start building a better and stronger and fairer and more hopeful America."
"Back to this, the first assassination attempt on Trump had a profound impact on the Republican National Convention."
Clinton was up by six.
"First up, let's talk about Kamala Harris."
"The state of democracy itself is another huge talking point, with 70% of voters expressing anxiety over the future of the country's democratic institutions."
"And so like it thrills me to see people who will stand up to Donald Trump and his supporters and his apologists and say, no, that's a bridge too far."
All of a sudden he says he's a Republican.
"He then accuses Vice President Kamala Harris of inventing a Southern accent in Atlanta, Georgia."
He said he's not really sure he doesn't know what President Biden is going to do.
Now that poll has Donald Trump up by 3 percentage points in Pennsylvania.
So just let us know what are they actually sort of counting now.
I've never had anyone ask me to get into a political rally now when I worked in the music But you and I know this Beccalane.
Am I saying he's going to win the state by three?
And we're doing that this cycle.
"And let's face it, we're probably looking at a whole bunch of close races this time around, too, especially in those swing states."
They were armed.
"And right now, as we speak, there are people inside counting those 400 now, I think 330,000 ballots that still haven't been returned in Maricopa County."
Also if there's a dispute on the ballot the ballot is taken and just the section that's being disputed is taken over to two people a Democrat and Republican to look at it.
The nonpartisan group States United Action says nine in 10 election deniers running for statewide office lost.
Like what year is it?
"Well, the advantage has always been to the Democrats, at least in recent history, just based on voter registration."
"And I think people are trying to get things on the momentum, but also to look at who her opponent is."
"And we should have a leader of this nation, a leader of the free world who at least meets those standards that most parents try and hold their children to."
You could make a very long list.
"Look, I know Donald Trump doesn't have anything to do other than campaigning."
"Again, you have one out of Rasmussen."
And don't forget to follow us on Spotify and turn on those episode notifications so you are never out of the loop.
"We have some sick people, radical left lunatics."
"A state Republicans won the governorship back in 2021, though no Republican has held Virginia since 2004."
"I think the shy Trump voter was always kind of like a false way of explaining it, especially as pollsters nowadays typically don't poll by phone as much as they used to."
"If Trump gets Michigan, by the way, again, it's all over."
"Time and time again, the state polling misses incredibly to the left."
"And in fact, in addition to that, you have different groups within the American public that have created their own network."
When was the last time?
"The latest poll in Virginia has Harris up 3 points, 47% to 44%, among 629 registered voters in this Qantas Polls and News sample."
"And there's been a lot of talk about black men in particular, Latino men who might be more interested in Donald Trump."
"They released a statement in CBS News magazine Sunday reading in part quote, when we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point."
And this wasn't three months before the election.
"On the one hand, incredible strength when it is intact, what it does for its people to protect and defend their rights, their liberty, their freedom."
"This happened in Wilkesbury, Pennsylvania."
But there's still more we need to do.
"Jim Nitzel, thank you so much."
"We will lower the cost on everything from health care to groceries, taking on, for example, the issue of corporate price gouging."
"In this sample, he's a little bit up."
"I mean, like we're struggling, man."
"This is much more simpler than, oh yeah, by the way, Trump cannot afford to lose Wisconsin if he does."
So thank you guys so much for watching this video.
We have the most accurate pollster.
"Throughout the town hall, the border and immigration were brought up multiple times."
I have seen the care in his eyes as he's crisscrossed this Commonwealth.
"Martha Green â€“ $1,000,000 Martha Green, an heir to a Pennsylvania steel dynasty, has long been a supporter of progressive causes."
Can you guys hear me okay?
 Here are the exact figures.
We want you to go vote because of something you just said on the back end there.
He's never done any work in his life.
What matters is these good paying blue collar jobs have been going away.
"If they can prevent the Trump campaign from flipping Georgia and hold on to their blue wall in the upper Midwest, that's gonna be the ball game for them."
"You want to, that's the kind of people you want to have."
I really don't know what the Harris campaign does if they lose Pennsylvania.
"All right, Dylan Smith from the tucsoncentennial.com."
"Andrew, what are you hearing from your friends?"
This is the news.
And they say he probably won't pay again.
And one of the things you had to do was go into court and basically preserve the kind of integrity of the state's election system underneath the sort of fuselage of lawsuits from the Trump campaign and others.
"Moving up to the at-lassing tell poll, conducted between September 20 and 25 with 1,775 likely voters, Trump leads Harris by three points, polling at 51% compared to Harris's 48%."
Now they've got Trump up in a national popular vote.
"It's why I've continued to stand up for the process that we oversaw in 2020, which was free and fair, and the results we certified are accurate, and why I'm going to continue to fight to ensure access for every eligible Arizona voter."
We did even better in 2020.
"I have been the recipient of many attacks from Donald Trump, including anti-Semitic attacks from Donald Trump over the years, as have the people of Pennsylvania and the American people."
"I'm no longer invited to art galleries, music festivals, tattoo conventions."

I'm sure there are.
"Today, Kamala Harris leads by one."
"I'm building a new pond, and the bass will pay for it."
He voted for Barack Obama once but is now all in on Donald Trump.
It would be in line even with where near closer to where Obama got in 2012 than it would be to Joe Biden's 2020 numbers.
This despite the fact that shootings for literally every reason over the past however many years have been by right-wing people who follow all these right-wing demagogues that are about to be like the leftist what caused this and everything and use this as their opportunity expect to see people pulling comments online of people previously talking about how Trump should get you know.
Is that just what you add it all up to and what we see now?
What were your thoughts?
Stay safe.
This is a relative of yours?
And Mark and Matthew.
My dog's been stolen.
It's a state that hasn't voted for a Democrat for the White House since 1996.
"It's a tied race, but the problem for Harris is those undecided voters, they lean heavily towards Trump."
And we can't let that happen.
"So in terms of that argument for 2022, but still I think it's important to take polling with a little bit of a grain of salt."
"And of course, I mean, it's like you ask Kamala Harris, well, we're on the brink of World War Three."
"That means they're using a 2020 election exit polls, essentially, to say this is what we're going to use for our polling sample here."

"Thank you, man."
That's the closest I might get.
This is what we're up against.
"Scott, this comes as all eyes were really on this rally because we are just days before the Republican National Convention and at any moment the president, the former president was expected to announce his VP pick."
Hillary up by eight point two.
The sixth poll was conducted between October 7 and 9 by TIPP Insights among 803 registered voters.
"So I think if Republicans can get the race back to talking about the issues, then the issues are on their side."
But it's probably vetted and that doesn't happen.
He only needs Pennsylvania.
Pick them up and on the legs they called.
"But instead, you see new Republicans and these new registrations."
Alvarez captures the haunted house in space vibe from Alien and the action-packed sci-fi adventure of Aliens.
"Now, when it comes to the debate, the former president has been having some informal policy sessions, his advisors tell us."
The Democratic Party has a really unique point to where they have been able to change the way people perceive their candidates months out from the election.
"So again, it comes down to not just how you experience it, but what you believe is happening in the country that kind of underpins a lot of that vote and why it doesn't move."
"You know, all those people that we had to turn away today at an outdoor rally, you can have, we had 107,000 people show up in New Jersey."

The routine and looking for something new.
I believe there's a whole world of business out there for different products.
"All right, let's just increase to the college student a little bit."
"Here, Donald Trump talks about dino dollars."
Hillary is also coming out of the woodwork.
"You just got to look it up and you just go, it's just a joke."
This would be a disaster for Pennsylvania.
This is Marxist.
People who are just trying to help.
What are people yelling behind you?
Yay!
Suburban voters.
It's certainly a state that Vice President Kamala Harris covets the most and it's a location in which both candidates have spent an enormous amount of resources.
I was an elected official for two terms.
"I've heard people are driving for hours to buy your cookies in person, or even shipping orders to Alaska and Hawaii."
"Throughout our history, the leaders of Alpha Kappa Alpha have stood up, spoken out, and done the work to build a brighter future for our nation."

"From there, he launched into more of his traditional talking points."
"So three minutes ago, here's what it was basically right about a 10 percentage point lead for Kamala Harris 54.2% 44.5% betting odds that's the chances they win Kamala Harris with about dang close to a 10 percentage point lead over Donald Trump."
"I think that you should do a skateboard collab with RFK, a Maha skateboard."
"And so for us, we do at times feel as if all the protesting, all the yelling and screaming, trying to highlight the atrocities that are happening and unfolding are leading us to nowhere."
"That's a possibility, I guess."
But everywhere else is a very good chance she'll bleed support on net.
"And if Congress passes that bill, Kamala Harris will sign it in too long."
She views her role as a high profile surrogate and people often forget she's not a politician.
I think they will.
"It requires physically opening an envelope, removing it, removing the ballot from the envelope, verifying the accuracy of the way it was filled out, inserting it into a machine so that it gets scanned."
"If you would, tell us about that call, and whether the former president or Mr. Giuliani raised allegations of election fraud."
They just worship their God who is Trump.
"Oh, my God."
"Like if you said that years ago that you're going to shut down fracking and you're not going to allow fracking, well, I believe as Americans we should honor each other's word."
It's going to be a whole new spirit.
She's saying we have not done everything we need to.
"Please, help me understand..."
The twelfth poll was conducted between October 7 and 10 by the New York Times Siena College among 857 likely voters.
Carol.
"Listen, I love the fact that in my state we uphold the Constitution."
We've got some New York Times had a really interesting set of oversampling of black voters and Hispanic voters.
I know we joke a lot about the size of Trump's crowds and his hands and his everything.
JD is great.
Were you this or that?
He's actually pulling ahead of a lot of Republicans and helping them.
Don't pray on people who are weaker than you.
Anything more can happen several times.
And there are lots of these tweets from another 2013.
Will I get to the next charging station?
"And he's underestimated Trump by about a point, both election cycles."
"His initial comments were, again, the litany of groups of illegal individuals or people deceased, et cetera."
"His flaxen-blonde hair and soft, supple lips will make everything better."
And it seems like most of those are coming home to Trump according to the latest poll.
"Blammo, right?"
"And I cover this stuff for a living, and it still was was pretty unnerving to me."
But nearly nine in 10 Trump voters say that it is bad.
That was the lowest number we ever had in the recorded history of our country.
He delivered for them in his first term.
I originally painted this to give to Elon back in 2019.
And the answer is yes.
It is a source of great consternation among major news sources in Arizona.
I could see this handsome guy.
That's the way they're framing it.
"Some swing voters who aren't happy with the fact that Biden is the nominee may also just not be voting for Trump, but may just be saying I'm undecided."
He is.
But I also encourage folks to start voting early.
"She has a four-point lead in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania."
"No, because I feel that for the last eight plus years that the country has really changed in such a way that is not good."
"We have to you know, take a look ourselves But you know and there's there's constantly all these You know rumors flying about the private deliberations between the two leaders and the fraught relationship that they have so that is tentative if true Yes That's a you know somewhat of a relief I would say for US officials that were pressing that both privately and of course as we heard from Biden in public Much to the dismay of some Israeli officials who didn't want to be instructed on how to conduct this retaliation So it does I think relieve a little bit of pressure But I think we have to be reminded that this isn't you know, everything is is all good between the two powers there They're allies You know the US is at pains to continue to say, you know This is all for Israel's defense as you heard from Hagar Shemali You know, this is to send a message in addition to actually provide the resources needed to finish this war But you know, there will still be disagreements And I think the US has been honest about that even in public that you know They don't always agree and they're being candid with each other Which the subtext is, you know, this isn't a great relationship a warming of ties But it is something that they both sides want to move forward and finish this off Well, we certainly have seen a market reaction to the reporting from the Washington Post oil futures are down more than 4% Right now WTI lower by nearly five full percentage points south of seventy two dollars a barrel once again So when we consider the political impact here for the Biden administration Why they had been encouraging a less escalatory move from Israel not going after energy or nuclear sites for example It was because of concern about how Iran could respond and disrupt potentially global energy markets right or at least a factor and stability Has been the name of the game since you know a year ago when the October 7th attacks happened It's a US desperately just wants to bring down the temperature and in any way we can on all these fronts You know, of course, we've got Hezbollah with defeat of Hamas All you know in the balance now oil is a significant portion of this story and you can see as you mentioned the market reaction Underscores just how sensitive these conversations are about how Israel retaliates even if the US continues to say it's justified"
And they're running out of time.
"I think that's, that's important."
" 15 states, plus the 2nd congressional districts in Nebraska and Maine, are potentially in play this November for either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump."
"And yeah, it would hurt if Trump were to lose Pennsylvania, but it's not the end of the world."
"The Harris actually wants to do something for a country, and I'm excited about them wanting to do something for the people of this country."
Although no tapes involved.
"Especially now, with the cost of everything, they need to be creative, find a different niche, advertise that."
"I mean, there was like literally half a dozen, maybe a dozen of these guys."
"No, it's Pennsylvania."
You look weird doing that.
"In both of those last two races, the state was won by those candidates by only a few tens of thousands of votes."
They're incredible people and they really do.
But he's not backing down from backing Kamala Harris in this race.
"Both parties are expected to invest heavily in campaigning in Pennsylvania, recognizing its potential to decide the next president."
What's the latest on your continued efforts looking into the two assassination attempts?
"When you stand for working people, you fight for working people."
"You know, I mean, thank you so much."
"Tom Rees says with our friends at WESA and Pittsburgh in reports, one Pittsburgh area lawmaker says she'll offer a bill to ensure cities have a say in whether or not to host rodeos."
I want the news so I can form my own opinion.
Because Biden's not in the race and you really don't care who else it is You just want you want a live person who can actually speak?
Our farm currently feeds out approximately 70 to 100 head of cattle and that is reduced from 180 to 200 head just two to four years ago.
Did you hear that guys?
"And we know that not only did Trump sick that mob on the Capitol, he gleefully watched them on TV as they tried to overthrow democracy."
So we got the biggest thing is inflation and economy.
"I said, I'm sure, oh, they must be celebrating the great life and times of the magnificently beautiful Sophia Lauren."
We'll let the lawyers decide if what he said was treason.
"Team Biden opened 14 offices across Pennsylvania in March alone and says it's working with more than 1,700 volunteers in the Commonwealth."
"There is a group that's emerging, especially out in the East Valley that is saying, look, we're supporting Democrats because they actually have common sense."
We're coming to the border because this is an incredible wound.
"She wasn't clear enough on the on the policies She did speak a lot of her personal history on her personal history Which was great, but I I still Don't feel like she's ready."
But you can sense that there is real potential ground to be tilled here for the Harris campaign.
But now Europe is just they're up our asses.
What's the reality?
"It does tilt her way here though on our latest polling map, joining Wisconsin, which does lift Kamala Harris up to 244 electoral votes now as Trump continues to lag behind at 228."
"But now that Kamala is there, everything she's done has been really well scripted."
I don't know.
That's smart on his part because he's always blaming the media.
You can't pay attention to what partisans say on election night.
"And he has said that over the past year, has kind of threaded that along in his campaign speeches, describing the enemy within as essentially his political opponents."
"I use that guy about 40, 50 custom flags I use, but couldn't bring them all out here."
So what this is possibly saying is we're seeing Kamala Harris polls getting more skewed up.
"This is something that we've seen every major female candidate have to deal with, frankly, in recent elections, is going back to Hillary Clinton."
"What kind of star power does Musk bring, do you think?"
What is this bus?
"Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, adding the United States, the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice?"
This is not a huge lead for Harris whatsoever.
We got it.
President Trump.
Middle class has both been decreasing in population share and seeing its cut of the income pie shrink.
Like it talks about how some traditionally blue states are seeing a lot of new people moving in and those new residents might not necessarily vote the same way as the people who have lived there for a long time.
"Yeah, Jose, well, for context here, last month the Trump campaign opened up a Latino-Americans for Trump office here in Reading, Pennsylvania."
"This year, there's a recount going on, abortion rights and voting rights measures that passed in Michigan election deniers are paying for a recount of some of the ballots there."
"Now the latest poll here in Texas from Public Policy Polling surveyed on August 21st and 22nd has Trump up 5 points among 725 registered voters, 49% to 44%."
"Those are all held by Democratic incumbents, Kenneth."
"If you think prices are high now, Donald Trump's message is, you ain't seen nothing here."
The ones everyone says they're Republican biased or they're a Republican pollster or some BS like that.
" And we see George Solis joins us now from Reading, Pennsylvania."
Don't look at the clips.
"Senator, I got to ask you what in the world was happening in Wilkes-Barre with that Donald Trump David McCormick speech?"
"But last night, definitely more bizarre Trump event that we've seen this election cycle."
Took about four or five seconds for a lot of us to recognize that first of all firecrackers shouldn't be lit or ignited at an event like this so there was something suspicious about it even though it sounded like firecrackers there was a pretty quick realization this could be something much more dangerous and let me be unequivocal about something.
Can you just walk us through some of the stuff that you have here?
"Yes, with a lot of coffee to fuel us through these next couple of weeks."
"Whoa, that's pretty crazy, Investopedia."
Let's see how much votes the candidates received in these polls.
"Now, we know, of course, that the people who are hit the hardest by Kamala Harris's terrible policies are very often those who can least afford to pay an extra $100 to go to the grocery store, or pay a few hundred extra dollars in rent per month."
How would he bring that up?
What I see right here is a rich white liberal.
"However, Trump's 2016 victory in Michigan marked a dramatic shift, as he won the state by a narrow margin of 0.2 percent, turning it red for the first time in decades."
Here's some article headlines.
I hope they see jackpot and I hope they're entertained.
And he's still maintaining this fantasy that he somehow won and that Joe Biden isn't really the president anymore.
The links on the community tab.
"And not just as a governor, but as a father of four, I try and raise our kids to love thy neighbor, to care about their fellow man, their fellow woman."
We stopped here in front of a grocery store and a targeted community because we know that inflation is high.
The United States used to do that.
"Now, wait, hold on a second, because this is a serious piece of business."
And that's where President Biden has been.
You can see here the picture of him.
And are you going to or what's going on?
It's been floated for years by various Republicans.
It is really fascinating.
"Atlas Intel showing a tie, even though they're not really partisan."
"They don't get nearly as much blowback from these people because the election mafia, they care about setting the narrative and they try to bully any pollster that does not exactly, you know, fit that narrative."
They were showing hundreds of lines of different hacking from other countries that night.
"Why does Charlemagne talk crap about Harris with Andrew Schultz, but not to her face?"
"Donald Trump, on the other hand, in a town hall outside of Philadelphia held an event where he was focused on support from suburban women."
It's a very rural county.
I'm sometimes frustrated with politics.
"Well, we thought... Oh, man."
But I also think we're going to see the shift from Harris back into a more aggressive prosecution of the case against Trump.
I'd rather listen to someone that's actually going to do something for this country.
And one of the things that we've seen is right now they're kneeling in prayer.
"15,000 people."
Let's look at this.
He only can afford to lose four Republican votes in order to become speaker.
But we have another song coming out in hopefully a month that is a tongue in cheek song about these political elites who believe they're the smartest and the best and they're better than you.
The former first lady has been working behind the scenes to boost Harris and they're expected to have her appear on the campaign trail but it hasn't happened yet.
"It's like, oh yeah, they didn't pay that back because, you know, it's just something we wanted to do."
It looks like John Wick is also a pollster.
What we could see is Suffolk University is literally number one.
Just one.
If like a Bernie type or a squad member or someone on the left had had such sour grapes about not being selected for vice president.
So what Donald Trump has proposed doing is we're going to stop doing mass parole.
"So what are you seeing, thinking and feeling about the Republicans' ground game?"
"But if you compare that to 2020 look at Rasmussen's final poll in the state of Pennsylvania, they had Biden leading by three points."
We don't know if people will believe her or not.
Trump touting his tariff policies for companies that are going to make their product in the USA.
"And I have been flooded with texts from people saying, oh, wait a minute."
So whether it was staged or not we need to buckle up because this campaign trail and presidential election has just gotten that much more interesting.
"I don't know what to make of that, but I find that interesting."
"How about that, Ace?"
He refuses to release his medical records.
He pretended to be Scranton Joe.
Support for the Republican candidate among black voters is at an all-time high in over a decade.
How is that even possible?
"Jeremiah 29 11 tells us for I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
"Now, seven million viewers."
"We're going to have beautiful, additional tax cuts, including no tax on tips, no tax on overtime."
I don't think that's good news for Harris.
And yet Trump has really not been able to catch up when it comes to that ground game.
"You've run for Congress, run for the US Senate and court important national security and support and support the And important national security things have happened in the last 24 hours."
"You know, and all this stuff, it's not going to happen, but that would be awesome."
"And I think what people wanna hear is, Pennsylvanians wanna hear is, do something that is gonna fix the inflation that I've been dealing with, the immigration, which is a big issue as well."
"We know it, and they know it."
"Well, first of all, we're in Butler and this is where an attempt, the first attempt on this man's life was July 13th."
These are new supporters for Trump for the Republican Party.
"As we keep saying in a state that's likely going to be one on the margins, this would appear as a worrisome data point for Democrats, is it?"
So we got 91 days.
"Well if you feel like this special episode gave you some better insight into the news of the day, please share it with your friends and on your socials because you can play a big part in spreading the word about the morning agenda and help us reach more people like you."
"Bob, I want to switch gears and talk about Florida Governor Ron DeSantis there is accusing Kamala Harris of playing a political game with the hurricane disaster response."
And that is signaling the strength of the DeSantis wing of the party.
"One line from the memo that really stuck with me was she said, quote, please give us the tools to win for as we all know, you do not win P.A."
"After Democrats and journalists have spent the entire election cycle claiming that crime is down, the FBI, three weeks before an election, revises the crime statistics, showing the crime increased by 4.5% in 2022 instead of dropping by 2%."
"They're actually eighth from the bottom, right?"
Democrats take them for granted.

It's not just about plans or concepts of a plan.
I don't like how he talks about women.
"I mean, if Donald Trump is winning Pennsylvania, he's probably winning Wisconsin too, and so that's really not a good sign for the Democratic Party."
I support Buybacks and it's something I'm so passionate about and so looking forward to being president to address how mandatory is your gun buyback program It's mandatory.
But then there's these other counties that have been kind of trending to the red.
The agreement was was terminated by us because they didn't do what they were supposed to do So that was the former president talking about the Afghanistan withdrawal where 13 US service members were killed in that chaotic process You're a veteran There are obviously personal feelings here as well that answer and it's been an issue these talked about constantly on the campaign What stood out to you for?
Many of the state's most well connected Democrats have been worried about the operation for months.
And my question to people is why do they believe that Donald Trump is incapable of making up 1% ground when he's going up against a candidate that is not all that good of a fit for Pennsylvania?
She does have a deficit in some states that are key to win.
She didn't do anything.
Full of joy.
I'm recording my video and I'm going back in the house.
"Right now, the two candidates are locked in a dead heat in the Keystone State, Harris holding a slim lead of only seven-tenths of a percent."
The Keystone State certainly looms large.
"No, it's not."
He's going to open the convention.
Every single one of them has the power to tank the agenda or to tank what the president wants.
He would also get Georgia and North Carolina.
They note X has responsibility to provide users access to guidance that reflects true and accurate information about their constitutional right to vote.
"Now, of course, when it comes to Kamala Harris going on cooking shows, going in restaurants, flipping burgers, I got a picture of Kamala literally flipping the burger."
You know it's definitely helped the financial benefits as far as the community continues to do well because they're getting royalties off of the gas wells so that's a good thing.
"But if you don't put Trump in, you're not going to have any energy jobs in here."
Or how about 58 would be.
That's the good news for our democracy.
So when you look at the Harris campaign they've taken so many different stops in rural deep red areas of Pennsylvania that from an outsider perspective you're thinking why are they spending their time.
"They think that he can dig his own hole, if you will."
Don't they?
Which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down when what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.
It's been practiced now for a couple of years where Democrats are more likely to vote by mail and more likely to vote early.
Latino voters especially.
Thank you so much for sticking with us.
"And I believe that Donald Trump, for eight years, he's been attacked."
"By the time I'm finished, it would be great to hand this off to him."
That I don't understand.
All of this is an effort for her campaign to do outreach and to make sure that black voters and especially black men end up turning out to vote in November.

None of the guardrails will be here in the second term.
"Somebody, one of the fake news back there, they corrected me one time."
"First, I wanna ask which candidate is leading so far?"
The eventual winner of these states could very well determine who sits in the White House come January 2025.

"At the same time, the state legislature is split, with Democrats controlling the House and Republicans maintaining a majority in the Senate."

"With the 2024 race in Pennsylvania, it also spread to other states, where Michigan and Wisconsin, who largely do vote with the state of Pennsylvania and hold very similar voter sentiments and voter demographics, also started turning away from President Biden, as well as the larger Democratic Party."
I think there's an emerging consensus on that.
What don't you like about Trump?
"With such high stakes, every move they make is crucial."
"But before we get started, go ahead and hit that like button, share this out so we can get this information out there."
"Today, we will analyze all seven of the latest poll results conducted in this state."
I love you.
Bye.
"We'll be writing something later this week to kind of have them, they can email those friends."
That's something that in the past Kamala Harris has been opposed to.
"As Pennsylvania Attorney General from 2017 to 2023, Josh Shapiro challenged many of them President Donald Trump's immigration policies, including the so-called Muslim ban, separating families at the border, and the attempt to change public charge rules to discourage immigrants from accessing certain government benefits."
"You know, putting Trump at 40 percent with the Spanish is kind of being a little bit generous to Kamala Harris, if anything, when you look at that."
Do they stay home?
"And then she, like I said, in line with what I'm talking about with all these Republicans all of a sudden that are so friendly with her, Mitt Romney."
I'm sorry to be the one to say it to you.
"The current polling data, showing a 50-50 split between Harris and Trump, indicates that Michigan will again be a critical battleground in 2024."
That's a one off.
"Quinnipiac, The New York Times, Suffolk, Franklin and Marshall."
"So all in all, this was the state where Donald Trump had his best chance to prove the outlandish theories that he's had about the elections being fraudulent or rigged."
"In Pennsylvania, it's fracking."
"This includes visits to local businesses and community events, such as her unannounced stop at a cafe and bookstore in Johnstown."
"And because decisions in the presidency, especially, are made by the character of the president making them, Donald Trump does not know how to tell the truth."

They were claiming that Biden actually won Pennsylvania by seven back in 2020.
Vitamin C. Vitamin C. Vitamin C and vitamin C. Right.
So don't take the betting markets too seriously.
"Bob Casey's problem is that he is an incumbent at a time when Americans are very dissatisfied with the status quo, especially on the Democratic side."
OK.
Mayers says most here will be deported within a day.
"Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben, Ruben."
There are things outside of it and I think that you don't have to understand it.
60% right here.
Sperg for your sir.
Revealing that Kamala Harris currently holds a narrow 49% to 47% lead over Donald Trump.
"So I still think the election can be decided, you know, at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. Eastern time, which is when it was decided against Hillary."
So we're on the completion side.
Vance is going to inherit something truly fantastic.
And then Wisconsin was off by 7.7.
"What does that have to do about good policies, effective policies that work for our country?"
The people love them.
"But in terms of Rust Belt State polling areas, that's on the low side."
These investments present a historic opportunity to change the game for so many communities struggling to access clean water across the country.
And I believe it too.
"Top Democrats in Pennsylvania, swing state, critical swing state, are worried."
She did it on everything from the border on immigration.
Let's compare these polls from 2020 to right now.
Her argument?
And we would like to have the legitimate opportunity through the committee to come to that end and remove that.
Shots fired at the Trump rally.
"And before this election, it was trying to close off the border, preventing people from coming in."

They want the freedom to throw out votes if they lose an election.
"It'll be really interesting to see here how the next few months and the next couple of years, as you point out, shake out as we look ahead to 2022."
"The bad news is when you have a race this close that's separated by 2 percentage points nationally or frankly, tenths of a percentage point in the battleground states, polls that are on average off by about 4 percentage points simply aren't going to be able to tell you who will win the election."
"I mean, this is a four day span."
And that was a telling sign that's sure Joe Biden may not have been the right guy to meet the moment today.
And the name calling and the nastiness does not help Donald Trump.
So it makes no sense.
So she knows a thing or two about connecting with voters.
And this is worrisome for her campaign for obvious reasons.
"I'm sorry, I can't do that."
And that's why we go back to talking about Pennsylvania and a couple of other states that North Carolina and Georgia are ones that come to mind that.
"But fine, voter registration, it's not everything."
They're concerned about the jobs that they have today being there tomorrow.
"Well, it's not."
And really what it's going to come down to in my opinion is character.
"So that's why I believe while this number is more than likely inflated, I still think these are good numbers for the GOP."
"It doesn't, it doesn't really matter."
Harris tonight responding.
"Polling and voter sentiment, recent polls show Harris leading Trump by a slim margin in Pennsylvania, with the economy being a top issue for voters."
We're an energy producing state.
When I learned of the vice president's return to Pittsburgh as a follow-up to her first visit it made me feel good to know that she genuinely cares and came back to hear the progress that has been made and to check on our communities in the city of Pittsburgh.
"Which is interesting, right?"
"They're not the ones, obviously, but it's not everything."
Nobody's a fan of Biden.
But what is this?
I've looked at some of the polling in your state.
These are the things we stand for and these therefore are the things we fight for.
"They found some ticked off ex-whatever employees like, oh no, but I have a Havana syndrome."
Perfect.
"Hey, can you help me get in?"
So who would I say would be the best candidate?
"But after I win, I will be asking Congress immediately to approve a 10% raise."
So we're going to be doing that.
He already was.
And he wasn't a problem.
More Trump stuff.
"He's a great guy, great young athlete."
That will happen every single day of our administration.
"That means look, Jill Stein and Cornel West are running for office, not because they promote Trump, but because they represent a constituency or Democratic ideals that the party is neglecting to acknowledge."
"But nonetheless, you are seeing Trump, this is very healthy."
Same poll has Trump up seven.
So there is a problem in the Kamala Harris campaign with black males.
"So, Senator Casey, I have a deep appreciation of that because I was on the opposite side of your first election for the United States Senate trying to defeat you, sir."
Harris is now more viewed positively according to this poll in Pennsylvania.
"So they're preemptively telling the big tech, Hey, listen, there's going to be some stuff coming out."
"Well, thank you, Chris, for having me today."
And so it affects the model.
They didn't allow full cameras.
"So that's Pennsylvania, that's the poll itself."
"And we were able to raise a tremendous amount of money for his family, which is great."
And I think I'll leave that right there for now.
"Well, Donald Trump and the debate coming up this week."
But Harris is directly tethered to those policies.
"I'm going to find this slide here because what you see is it depends on what you think has been going on in the country in relation to, here we go, gender equality efforts."
Does this scream a landslide for her?
"If I'm Trump, I'm in Pennsylvania every freaking, I mean, I can't be there every day."
"When I say rhino, I'm a Republican in any moment."
There is a heartbeat.
"And you know, this whole talk about project 2025 and they're just trying to attach that to Trump and they're saying that that has nothing to do with Trump."
"And together, we will make America powerful again."
"So again, you know, in Nevada's defense, they're counting at record speed and it's an unprecedented all-mail election for them."
"Despite Trump's attacks, Harris's position on fracking may not be as detrimental as it once seemed."

They're signing up for shifts to make calls and send texts and knock on doors.
"So I think Biden is a good thing, a good pillar, a good anchor."
"You just need one more state and you've won, whether it's Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan."

"I mean, he is out there, he's given two, two and a half hour speeches, just word salads."
"fracking is a big, big industry now here."
"Joe D, I appreciate it."
They thought it was too harsh.
Do 24 hours of a show with Kamala Harris?
Might have to do in part because he's not holding events that size.
That's the number one thing that we can do.
I question Trump's support at 46 percent.
The original number was sixty four.
"You know what else is real, dude?"
Charlie Williams and I will moderate along with Univision 65's Ilya Garcia.

It's not anymore.

"So half a point in the polling average He's up in Trafalgar Wall Street Journal Inside her advantage Emerson tip and Rasmussen reports and that's pretty good for him He's tied North Star opinion research as you can see here, but you might slow doesn't have many respondents So it's not too bad for Trump, but he's down to in Quinnipiac and three New York Times, Indiana obviously, those are left leaning pollsters in terms of previous track record, even though they nailed 2022 up and So I don't think they're the best pollsters for the rust belt, but that is like the good news for Harris Obviously Rasmussen is not that good of a pollster, but still they did have Biden up three So, you know that is it is something good for Trump."
And I love Harry Enten and much love for my friend Harry.
We all know what F is.
We have sixty thousand Democratic voters who are voting uncommitted in the primary.
One is that the third party vote share was very much pushed down.
We want our peace.
 Are you ready for President Donald J. Trump?
We had Bobby Kennedy.
"As you know, Pennsylvanians very, very well."
"Vice President Kamala Harris is making multiple stomps in Michigan on Friday, a crucial battleground state in this race."
We'll see how Kamala lies about that tomorrow.
"And my friends, there is nothing compassionate about bankrupting our country by giving benefits to people, rewarding people for breaking our laws to enter the country in the first place."
Kamala Harris received 50% of the vote and Donald Trump 44%.
"What the Arizona Republicans are doing here, this process by which they are bastardizing the actual secure election from November 2020, and they're going to produce some results that says that it was some other fraudulent thing, will be used by the Trump part of the Republican party and the Trump right to cast out on the 2020 election among their most fervent supporters in a way that none of their failed lawsuits in the past have been able to do."
"They stopped doing it about a year ago because under Kamala Harris's rising grocery prices, they just can't afford any more with their grandkids that they're raising."
They've got the shooter.
And I was filling it with filing updates with my editor as I went up until I got shut down.
So there's no way that either candidate is going to give any ground here.
"He's already put in four million dollars and we expect him to put in a hell of a lot more than that this month, next month and on October."
We will make America proud again.
"The only poll 10% black and 70% white and you're like, oh man, that's not good."
So they hold the key to the U.S. selections of who the next president would be in these swing states.
We're going to have the largest deportation in history.
"With any contrived desire towards deflection of my deep foundational desire to follow God's will, as I believe he led my conscience to embrace."
"I'll bring the Philly cheesesteaks next time, Kenneth."

It's not like done in a sec.
"So what she's arguing is raise the minimum wage, then allow people to get taxes or get their tips and not tax that taxable income or that tipable income."
"They've cleaned out the voter rolls, et cetera."
"The other day I saw her get up and say we will do this, we will do that, we're gonna, why didn't they do it four years ago?"
"Now, our playlist would probably be better, but..."

"Now we go to the average on real clear politics where Kamala Harris, thanks to this Quinnipiac poll, has now actually taken a lead in the Pennsylvania average, up to 0.6 percent now."
"So let me ask you a hard him talk about, you know very direct and forward a you because a lot of peop side of the spectrum, the they say that it bothers you?"
"Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, a different approach."
You guys see it more than most.
"I know you wanna talk about policy, and I respect that, but the reason that Donald Trump is not up 10 points is because of comments like that one, where people do have concerns about his fitness, his acuity, and his stability."
Bob needs our help.
I guess it's maybe possible.
Which America do you want to live in?
Don't try to shut their business down.
Something was planned.

"Well, he asked if my three boys were standing right behind me, which they were."
"You know, Democrats usually vote for Democrats, Republicans vote for Republicans."

"These are staples for the Latter Day Saints, but everybody should want."
"Caitlin Becker live in Pucks County, Pennsylvania for us."
The assassination attempt on Donald Trump's life yeah I'm just struggling to kind of wrap my head around that one.

The cyber ninjas say they hired a subcontractor to actually physically handle the ballots.
It is doable.
It should.
"These are close races, but the stakes are incredibly high."
"So that's like a net swing of 240,000 votes."
"In Charleroi, Pennsylvania, seen a 2000% increase in the population of their town."

I Like his policy with the border and that's my favorite I think we should need to deport all of the illegal immigrants and I think that we need to take our country back Absolutely.
And it just goes to show you.
"Oh, wait, because she has to win votes."
But this is one of them.
I'm the best one.
"And now, for those who haven't seen it, let's watch the results of the polls, in which Kamala Harris did very well."
"And in fact, when you look at the early voting data voter registration polling everything, it all looks bad for Democrats."

"And Trump does want to negotiate with Russia, which for some reason is controversial here."
"We had two months ago, we were in the Nassau Coliseum, which is essentially the size of Madison Square Garden, the big arena."
Who knows what's going to happen next in this crazy election cycle?
But then we also ask this question here retrospectively.
And it's crazy because Trump endorsed Sean Parnell early on and rightfully so.
"Okay, let's keep going."
"And Nicole, I want to go back to you because in Georgia, you're in Atlanta, if I understand that correctly, not only Fulton County, but the surrounding suburban counties crucial there as well."

"Oh, they love to go to the YMCA and swim a few laps before they go out on dates with their wives and girlfriends."
Man that stays that assassination attempt man I ain't gonna lie about it you got 24 hours to stage your own assassination attempt in response.
And we do see our Daniel Miller right there.
"One of the things I wanted to point out, Anna, most of what you see here are volunteers."
D plus eight.
"The president has made, has taken historic steps to keep gas prices down."

There are two big problems with the cheap plastic disposable razors.

"Because if I take it away from Kamala Harris on my current election prediction, let's say she wins Michigan."

"So that's coming either way, even if it's not a great time in the news cycle for it."
"I do have to point out that along with his intentions, there is also a question of his competence."
I know you all in this room are involved.
"You're down in Georgia or Michigan, I should say."
So one thing that was concerning here when those protests erupted is that there are a number of people inside trying to do the work at the Maricopa County Elections Office and they did last night have to be escorted by the sheriff's office back to their cars as they went to leave.

"Don't vote for something that you don't believe in just because, you know, you appeal to your friend or Instagram or any of this nonsense."
"Mark Burnovich, he's the attorney general who you and I have talked about in the past of Arizona here."

And you're getting like a 42 and a half.
"And he's also been supportive of school vouchers in the past, and he's obviously not talking a lot about that now."
"So, we're currently 29 days away from the 2024 presidential election."
Go ahead.
"So listen, this is crazy."
"The pushing with Kamala with more current things like Chaperone and Charlie XCX when it comes to more pop culture stuff, I don't really agree with that."
"Again, I'm not saying it's a guarantee."
"Kratz took to Facebook to express her frustration, writing that while Governor Walz spoke with volunteers for approximately six to seven minutes, the press was not permitted to ask questions or even place microphones near him."
"Now, Bobby, during her recent appearance on ABC's The View, Vice President Harris was asked if she would have done anything differently than Biden during their term together."

It was nothing inappropriate about it.
"And while he was trying to make inroads with women, he is getting some pushback for comments that he made during that town hall where he said that I am the father of IVF."
Things don't happen that way.
"We're joined by Daniel Malinson, he is Professor of Public Policy at Pennsylvania State University."
"Oh, it's a computer."
He's not even a citizen.
They can't you can't kill a baby after it's born.
I think you have to investigate the other side of it.
He's straight up.
How did this come to be?
Kamala Harris is locking down food network voters.
"I'm sorry, but that's not enough."
Certainly could increase his fundraising base for when he runs for reelection.
Kamala Harris received 50 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 48 percent.
"Separate from that, he also issued a separate ruling requiring that local officials and jurisdictions certify their election results on time."

"Yeah, Twitter back and forth."
"And my son said, that's not a long distance, 100."
The so-called Democratic superstar.
It's also a place that George W. Bush did well.
"And right now we still need more polling, but it really does look like the response bias is starting to fade, even if it's just a little bit."
This is a very winnable election for Trump.
"And these panels have had problems this time out, in my opinion."
He's a former teacher.
"So we'll check out 538, latest polls for President of the United States in the great state of Pennsylvania and very, very close race."
Rachel.
Now Chen cautions the beef stakes could come back to hurt Shapiro's chances at reelection if voters see him as an ambitious candidate who might seek higher office before his second term is up.
You know you can agree to grist degree.
"And we just can't say enough that when I send you some pictures later on this week, and next week of what we're able to pull off here, this sort of scared the pants off of the Democrats."
And that means spending time with folks in the communities where they live.
They're trying to.
It didn't happen.
"But Erie County of all the counties in Pennsylvania, Erie County is the one that is most representative of what's going on in the entire state."
He's calling her comrade Kamala now because she's trying to institute communism.
You see what happened yesterday?
"What I would add, Charlie, go ahead."
"And to kind of point that out, again, just another sign of the support behind the former president, but again, a really significant amount of money coming in in addition to someone like Miriam Adelson, who again, huge, huge donor, she has donated over $100 million a cycle to the former president."
Because it is clear from internal Harris campaign data that this group is more up for grabs than it was in 2020 or even 2016.
So why are Gen Z voters so important this year?
Try to lay low and avoid attention.
That's why the vice president is going to be there on Friday.
"In the first five minutes, Vice President Harris talked about her plan to expand small businesses and give new small business owners a $50,000 tax deduction to help them afford to start a business."
"I could certainly see Harris, if she wins the state, getting 50 to 51 percent of the vote though."
And they still elected him you know in charge of this little area of the GOP.
They were never going to win Florida.
She needs to convince voters she represents both continuity and change.
Where's Jason at?
"But, you know, once she became the candidate, there was a change in the conversation."
Arizona showed up in historic numbers and they participated in a very secure election.
I'm now turning on 80 songs to go back to the eighties.
That's them.
"And yes, I think the Biden Harris administration should get some credit for that."
Quinnipiac is awful.
"I don't know if you heard this, but Marjorie Taylor-Green is pushing this bonkers idea that Democrats can somehow control the weather."
"Miss Fifield, thank you so much for being here."
"And yes, this would allow Trump to lose Nevada."
Things are going to change.
I don't think shooting is okay.
"Because having people divided and angry and aggrieved and resentful, he figures that boosts his chances to get elected."
Do you believe your vote can make a difference?
But to add spending is just outrageously expensive here.
"Well, look, I think that the message to them is like, is Donald Trump even talking about anything you care about?"
It has six electoral votes just now.
"And listen, we broke the national record for the lowest unemployment rate in the history of the United States of America because people in South Dakota understand we were created to serve each other."
And that's what he's doing here.
And I know a lot of Republicans were a little worried because Donald Trump wasn't having a whole lot of fun in September.
It doesn't really matter.
I have one child.
12.
"Um, he's very well spoken and I think he's the perfect story of coming from literally nothing Yeah, not only coming from nothing but coming around from being an anti-trump and never trump in the past Have you heard this stuff?"
"We're talking about Pennsylvania, of course."
"I mean, they're really leaning into the she needs to be introducing herself to the American people."
I ain't gonna lie because you do shit.
39% are college graduate or professional with another 30% some college.
"And by the way, I will give you one guess."
"I think I know some people that are like I personally think he's a terrible person or I'm appalled by some of these things, but I fundamentally think that I'll still vote for him."
"This comes as more than five million Americans have already voted early, including at least 415,000 Pennsylvanians who have already mailed in ballots."
"We believe in the freedom to provide for our families if we're willing to work, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to send our kids to school without worrying if they'll come home safely."
"First, the size of the state."
"If the same error occurs, not even that, just a two point miss, not a three point miss, that's still a Trump win."
"Libby, we haven't gotten in touch with those two actors or the two people who were featured in that ad, so we're still trying to find these people."
Now let's continue.
So you've run this stand for nine years and you haven't voted?
That's what people know.
It's a disgrace and it's something that we need to make sure doesn't happen again.
I can hear you.
The states just vote so closely to each other that's just not possible.
He talked the talk of raising the minimum wage and keeping jobs and manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania and in America.
They've passed it in Arizona.
Maybe it's wrong.
Nobody in this room has been listening to the analysis We've actually all been talking amongst ourselves.
He must win to preserve democracy in America.
Last thing I wanted to ask you about is trump's vp pick.
"Biden did win after all the votes were counted, but by less than half a percentage point."
This is why she came out after the election when she lost and she never really got over that or admitted it by the way.
Bring them in now.
She's talked about fracking in ways like this.
"A good morning to you, it is Wednesday, September 25th, and this is being recorded at 5.18 a.m."
"I wouldn't take anything for granted, but I'm feeling optimistic."
"But Ruben and I were talking to a remarkable group of men right before we came out, and we were talking about this, and somebody said, I'm just so tired of everybody being divided and mean and nasty."
More bulletproof glass and other things.
I think that I wouldn't vote for Trump no matter who was running against him.
He's not too happy.
"This election, Kamala Harris and Erie, Pennsylvania at this hour, making her case on the economy, arguing her policies will help middle class families reaching out to black voters."
Answer a series of questions on their site and a medical provider will determine the right treatment option.
"Now I read through this entire report and I can tell you that the rest of it, the depths of it, is really a lot of conspiracy spaghetti thrown up against the wall."
"So bringing her on board, that's a good sign."
There are no city officials around.
And that's what Dr. Oz did.
"But already, out of the gate, compared to the totals in 2020 and 2022, you're seeing a ridiculous shift on day one in Nevada."
We'll call them NPR Republicans.
I gotta go ahead and chant.
"Here in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania."
You believe in what you believe in as a Republican.
"Now I've hired Whoopi to work for me as a comedian before this stuff, and a long time ago."
This is Harris point seven.
"So I don't know if it's going to be Democratic older voters that might have their votes thrown out, but it's saying far more Democrats and Republicans vote by mail in Pennsylvania."
Critical state.
This election will likely come down to which candidate can best address the concerns of an increasingly polarized electorate.
"I'm excited that he is on Team Humanity, you know?"
Release the transcript.
It was there.
Dronald Drumpf and all the sort of stuff that you saw in 2016.
"I always you know, I should know better because I live in Philadelphia I always sort of mess up Wilkes-Barre or Wilkes-Barre, but I'm sure that you can probably correct me What's the what's the significance of this location?"
"New York Times, a five point shift towards Trump."
"Yeah, that's exactly the result that you get but still Donald Trump is fine."
And now you're talking about Kerry Lake because Kerry Lake is going to perform a lot better than the polls indicate.
People don't really feel that way.
"Over the weekend, Kamala Harris released a summary of her medical records revealing that she is quote, in excellent health and adding quote, she possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency to include those as chief executive head of state and commander in chief."
Donald Trump sees that as an enemy.
"If you look at the polls, you would have thought they would gain traction from November until now."
"So in order to meet the goal of hiring 10,000 new agents, we need the agents."
"I mean, Barnett actually has done well."
"And if you put all that together, it's a harder sell to say you're now going to just turn around on all these issues when very recently you had a completely different viewpoint on them."
"One's a presidential year election, two totally different set of circumstances."
And today we got to talk about president Donald Trump working a shift at a Pennsylvania McDonald's.
Like there's this quote from Ryan Boyer.
Am I do you want to?
"They shouldn't have been allowed in the first place, but now that they are here, there has to be a pathway to citizenship."
"Let's head to a southern battleground state, right?"
And that helped Trump because his enthusiasm numbers were through the roof compared to Biden.
Trump could have said this up himself so people will rally behind him so he could win the presidency or somebody fucking missed.
"And they believe that Joe Biden is sending people into panic, which is causing this, which caused the situation today."
"OK, at some point when it came to Trump lost to Biden, who was in his basement, that's not believable."
"I do think though that the statement of either a mandate or a government funded IVF for parents, I think that shocked a lot of Republicans too, because traditionally Republicans don't like mandates like that."
"We got the Trump iconic mug, my favorite."
"Crime also usually pops up, but these have been fairly crime abortion as well."
I don't know if you've been watching him lately.
"They need people on the ground who get it, who can connect with those voters authentically."
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 48 percent each.
"I don't know what the reason is, but a lot of them don't want to vote Trump."
Take a look.
Voter enthusiasm.
"And I really don't want to seem as if they are, treated as if they are."
I'm not happy one way or the other it doesn't really affect me But I believe that they made the right decision and kicking it down in states Last thing I wanted to hit on if Kamala were to be elected.
Democrats have tried to make this a focal point of this entire election.
Attorney General Chris Mays brought her daughter Hattie to witness Harris's arrival.
"Since then, nothing."
"So, you know, I just hope that we can bring down these barriers whether if you don't like my ideas or the information that I bring to the table, we, you know, even though it's a patent that you really can't argue."
She can't.
And then there you have a guy who will just lie about it to score political points.
It's garbage you're going to use once and then you're never going to use it again.
He didn't demonize his political opponents.
Semis of votes were coming in and didn't look good.
And it was interesting to see because Centre County has been a tightly contested race the last two presidential elections.
And its global implications.
"Unfortunately, there's just no silver bullet to these things."
"I got to tell you, I've heard voters for Trump."
"He criticized her record on immigration crime and gun control, accusing her of failing the American people."
Trump Vance.
We left the border to take the temperature of other Arizona voters on immigration.
But those are the ones we're waiting on right now.
Was told to shut the fuck up and then they finally replaced him.

"And if he's elected president, I believe that he'll make policy change."
"Now the state of Maine and the state of New Hampshire, along with Minnesota over here, have followed similar trends over the last couple cycles."
I'm just guessing.
She says something to the cyber ninja guy about the fact that the counters have the blue pens.
"However, several key states, including Pennsylvania, are leaning Republican."
So as I mentioned we're taping this on Monday night September 30th.
"The Trump hat, but here's the full video, uh, and the full context."
Vance doesn't have the ability to appeal to the average voter.
"If you're a middle class family or a family trying to get into the middle class, Kamala Harris is going to cut your taxes."
And so I think what you see here are some of the same things you see elsewhere.
We had a good time.
"Oh, one of the greatest orders of our generation, whether whether you love him or don't love him quite as much."
So those around Trump said that he has long feared the attempt on his life.
"We know, but I'm objective and it wouldn't be fair for me to cover the Pennsylvania polls without shedding some light on some Wisconsin news that might not be so good except, you know, we got to understand where this is coming from because you have a poll in Wisconsin."
"But what I often tell folks is when there's an issue unfolding that impacts my residents directly, I have a responsibility to use a platform that has been privileged to me by the residents to speak up and to ensure that their voices are heard."
"While attendance was low, confidence was not."
Didn't do it.
They installed her.
"Trump heard and was like, He is?"
Loy Roberts is a columnist the Arizona Republic and azcentral.com and she joins me now.
He's a great speaker too.
It's interesting.
"On the other hand, here's Governor Walz."
But do you care more about the election now?
"They're fighting still, Laura, over whether or not the microphones will be turned off when it is no longer the candidate's time to speak."
"Down in Florida, another electoral giant here with 30 electoral votes, it was one of just five states where Trump managed to improve on his 2016 margin, as he carried it by 3.4% in 2020."
He's the head of the city's building trades council.
Stierwald emphasizes the importance of Harris energizing this demographic.
"The head of Cyber Ninjas, the guy on the left, this random QAnon-promoting guy who Arizona Republicans assigned to lead the audit, he kept insisting at this hearing today that this is an incredibly complicated, incredibly complex, very, very difficult process."
"Right now, inflation and prices are up, wages and savings are down under the disastrous policies of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden."
"Pennsylvania has a special issue, and it's the fracking issue."
"And I've always been saying this, that Erie picks the winner of Pennsylvania, and then Pennsylvania picks the president."
He was like the second highest donor to their campaign saying that they manipulated the election with big tech.
I could fairly see either of the candidates winning.
Take a look with Kamala Harris having a one point edge over former President Donald Trump nationally.
"By Tuesday night, November 5th."
"It's a method by which you extract natural gas, which is the cleanest fossil fuel in America."
"Walz and Harris head to Michigan and Wisconsin and I'm told that it is in the Midwest where Walz is from, that the campaign believes he can be the most helpful, especially since the Republican vice presidential nominee is from the Midwest as well."
"All right, I'm gonna I'm gonna walk."
So the protest was peaceful but the people inside were uncomfortable enough that they did leave with the help of the sheriff's department.
"I mean, in the month of August, Republicans gained 21000 voters."

"Although I do got some individuals out there I really got some hate for you know, but to to want to see Someone uh lose their life is like whoa, you know what?"
"To see how the issue was being twisted and these individuals were being maligned and threatened and completely misunderstood, I felt it necessary to speak out because I represent everyone in my district, even those people who are there on work visas and are doing their best to raise their families."
"But I mean, I don't know how true this is, but I look, me personally, I think Trump's probably going to get somewhere around 14% of the black vote."

He said he was a head of Harris when it comes to the polls.
"30, 30%."

"Last question, did you get a sense from anyone that they feel like the Republican genies out of the bottle and they're never going to be able to put it back to what it was in the John McCain area before that?"

Watch this.
"No, there's a good chance that these are just new voters that have registered to vote and they are becoming Republicans."
"Furthermore, Trump has passed one three of these states."
I can't be poor.

But that's Quinnipiac of The New York Times.

"Speaking of Trump, I read that he's holding a big fundraiser in Palm Beach that I expected to raise $43 million for his campaign."
This is a must-win situation.
So we've got to laser in and focus on it.
That's better than wasting a lot of words.
That is what this is.
Number one is the whole world changed in 2022.
"We know some of those people will be voting at the polls and just because they're less afraid of a pandemic, but still, you wouldn't expect that to fully carry over."

Why are we doing this?
I've been around since Barry Goldwater.
There's a lot of focus on your state.
She is going to North Carolina for a handful of rallies on Thursday.
Burn fat and feel more energized than they have in years.
"If I was charged in the way Jenna Ellis was, I'd probably be the very first one to roll in on a proper agreement and cut a deal because professionals, lawyers like Jenna Ellis have more to lose than say a hardened criminal who's looking at his third conviction."
"Again, rising take-home pay, low inflation."
So this could literally threaten sensitive law enforcement activities across the state of Arizona if we were to turn these routers over.
"And then it has this diagram here, which actually notes how much money is being made by middle class people one sec."
She is me and I am her.
I love it.
Burnovich's latest fundraising plea makes it abundantly clear that he has no intention of actually doing his job.

Vance was in Pennsylvania.
"I saw another creator, a white creator, addressing the video that has been going viral."

It was ultimately rejected over lack of evidence of fraud.
"Millie, I lost respect for Millie."
"You know, 82% to 15."
Even if you had a family member who acted like that you might still love them but you tell them you've got a problem and you wouldn't put them in charge of anything and yet when Donald Trump lies or cheats or shows utter disregard for our Constitution when he calls POWs losers or fellow citizens vermin.

"They held an oversight hearing on Arizona having reviewed its election results with this partisan, weird QAnon promoting cyber ninjas Trump audit."

Trump can't really rise above.
Now we're for it.

"Thank you, Pennsylvania."
And I know you love it here.
 here is showing a narrow two-point lead over former president Donald Trump that is well within the margin of error our political editor Dennis Welch is here now to break down those numbers yeah and when you say within the margin of error what you're basically saying statistically it's a dead heat now Arizona's family commissioned the survey in partnership with the local public affairs firm high ground and it reaffirms what we've been seeing so far that Arizona's 11 electoral college votes which could determine who wins the White House are still very much in play for both candidates here are the top line numbers they reveal Harris leading Trump 47 percent to 45 the results also reveal that 45 percent of those surveyed say they've already made up their mind to vote for Harris while 41 percent say they will definitely be voting for Trump I think one of the biggest takeaways here is that the race is very close and getting closer we've seen some surveys where Trump has a narrow lead we've seen others where Harris has a slight lead all of them have been within the margin of error Paul Bents is the longtime Arizona pollster who conducted the survey commissioned by Arizona's family his data reveals that Harris is doing a better job convincing voters to cross party lines at this point the vice president has convinced more than 12 percent of likely Republican voters to support her on the other hand Trump has only managed to convince 1.7 percent of Democratic voters to back his candidacy the two candidates are also evenly split with voters who are unaffiliated with any party while Trump is leading by double digits with independence what we're really seeing is that the Democrats are much more solidified behind their candidate they very much circled the wagons whereas Republicans are still struggling internally with at least a portion of their party Harris is also doing better than expected with voters 65 years and older the two candidates are evenly split at 48% among this reliably Republican block and like the previous two presidential cycles Trump is doing much better in rural parts of the state than Harris while the VP leads in Arizona's two most populous counties Maricopa and Pima and this survey was conducted at the end of last week another interesting data point here is the gender gap with Harris winning more than 52 percent of female voters to Trump's 40 percent while Trump is winning over 50 percent of male voters to Harris's 42 percent yes we've been saying for a long time it's going to come down to a couple hundred thousand voters in seven swing states of course Arizona very pivotal and the last presidential race was decided by like ten point five thousand here in Arizona yeah and if you look at the data here maybe it's not surprising but 86 percent are pretty much made up there they're locked in so 14 percent out there maybe maybe could be moving movable but you know it's going to be very close we knew that I know the election is a little over a month away but remember early voting starts next week so we're already in the middle of this and Dennis these were a likely voters not just registered voters yeah these were picked by basically on how often they vote these are people who are reliable voters out there they wanted to get a sense of who were they supporting how are they voting what's going to happen with them now that does leave open some room could there be an influx of new voters out there have Republicans identified voters who haven't typically voted in the last election cycle the last couple could Democrats do the same thing there's always a lot of questions to be answered well with these polls there's always things you can look at with a little suspicion just like every poll but as politicians have told me for years decades now the only poll that matters is in November yeah take a good thing they call this a snapshot in time which is what it is we like it it's interesting to see the breakdown Dennis thank you
They're inner reflections and you try and paint those realms.
But they had two individuals that they had speak to reporters there.
"But when Trump says, I'm going to come back to the place where I took a bullet, nearly died, that is a powerful statement."

Pennsylvania has 19 electoral votes.
Right.
"Can you believe and the end one year ago, Trump told that same story, but he's acting now like it happened again."

Harris also touched on some hot topics of this year's race like abortion.

"We went there, supported him, had a great time, got our lung full of tear gas and left."
How are you?
It's been one of the most disturbing aspects of this election season about Trump's rise in politics is how we seem to have set aside the values that people like Dan stood for and Bob stood for and that I was taught.
I think the power of Gen Z was shown in 2020.
One of those values that Reuben shares and that's talked a lot about in the campaign is freedom.

"Why do you think both campaigns, they're kind of ignoring Wisconsin, Nevada, but they're throwing everything at Pennsylvania, Georgia, kind of Arizona, but they're targeting Pennsylvania, Georgia the most because if you win just one of these two states of your Trump, your pathway to winning the presidency is all but secured."

"Bianca, thanks."
Both candidates have found support in Pennsylvania in recent polls.
I need to pretend like Harris has got this sort of stuff.
It's not hard to see why.
Join the movement.
Greetings to the audience.
How much to align with Biden versus how much to differentiate herself from him?
"I've said for a while now, watch his rallies."
We'll see if he does.
But you can see they're literally fourth from the bottom.
I'll edit it up a little bit.
And so that can give Pennsylvania added attention.
Because so because there's like just days before the primary.
"And so, so anyway, I think it's a, it's a plus both politically, you know, and for the broader ideological project."

"Yes, you heard that right."
"Well, look, I think that we're in a better..."
"More fundraising ever, more money ever, more resources at the disposal of the Democratic ticket and a honed in electoral strategy that is far narrower than the 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020 campaigns of what was 10 plus swing states have now been reduced down to seven."
"Now, again, they are not exactly alleging that they completely agree with all of these concerns."

"It was also the closest presidential race in Arizona history, Arizona being a state that has largely been a Republican stronghold for the past 70 years."
"He keeps losing again and again and again, even worse than he thought."
"Harris's challenge lies not only in maintaining democratic turnout in these pivotal counties, but also in crafting messages that resonate with moderate and undecided voters who may feel alienated by the prevailing political discourse."
"So now with those margins in mind, Nevada will tilt towards Trump on our electoral college map, while Arizona goes in the lean column."
And also for the public to understand who she is as a candidate and what she will bring to the table if she were to become president of the United States.
And so I think that explains why she's out there today.
We saw the result.
Is he going to get the black turnout?
We need a t
Good afternoon Pittsburgh.
Trump has a pretty good shot at winning back some other states.
" So Governor, appropriately, the Spilly suburbs and city of Philadelphia gets a lot of attention and a lot of people talk about the T, which is, let's just call it, for lack of a better term, we know what it is, but it's not a center in northern part of the state."
"He's used the word Palestinian as a slur against Chuck Schumer to say that he quote, he's almost like a Palestinian."

So I have registered over 40 b and some of their family registered.
It's very ser you have a good day.
And that is what I want to see in a President of the United States of America.
But I think what you're finding is the coalition that was built by Joe Biden to defeat Donald Trump four years ago is not tightly knit together.
"It's tailor made and it's really working out well for, for people."
And there's just so many swing voters that they determine the outcome.
Trump won this state by almost a point.
I asked just how she was going to do that.
That's higher than any other state in the country.
"And just recently, Republicans have edged out Democrats by two hundred and seventy seven voters."

But maybe something crazy happens.
"Gallego with a much more sizable lead here, the largest of the two, he's running ahead of Kamala Harris, right?"

"Now, if you take Fayette County, which I mentioned earlier, talking in comparison to Philadelphia County, you actually have a 10% decrease in the amount of voters voting there, yet the numbers have gone up 13% for Donald Trump during this time."
"So if Donald Trump were to win Pennsylvania, he really wouldn't need much more, just 16 electoral votes."
Harris is underperforming with them.
"There's another woman in the states talking about how a news page, a blog page was literally making him that what is not by literally a detail in the picture, changing it to black and white just to make it seem that what it's not."
"But moving on from that, the head of the company that was hired to oversee this forensic audit actively promoted Donald Trump's attempt to undermine the election."

"We need these, we need to come out and wreck our numbers."
I'm calling this Trump's hood.
That's what a lot of people like about her.
There are phone calls into police stations that are verifiable.
Your pathway to the presidency is not multiple pathways.
40 and then past that we're all getting cuts.

"No, I'm not disappointed maggot."
"Democrats technically are increasing their raw vote totals and their firewall, which is expected because, you know, the mail-in vote is overwhelmingly Democrat."

"Like Harris, he is also a former attorney general."
" Let's bring in Harris campaign spokesperson now, Ian Sams."
It never has been.
"The polling got closer, but the raw data from voter registration suggests, uh, no, there is not a Democrat surge."
He couldn't answer that question.
"Maybe Harris Faulkner, the Fox News moderator, will keep it more on message."

The federal agencies have now combined with local law enforcement.
It doesn't rip away some part of you to cast your ballot for a Democrat.
That's a big freaking deal because Notre Dame is a Catholic university.
"But Patrick, you know, going back to Democrats in panic, I wanted to put up the national numbers for you."
"Whereas Nikki Haley, who has been out of the race for over a month, got about 18% of the vote."
Shapiro uses this example to illustrate the difference between the two.
Trump is thus just eight electoral votes from the presidency currently.
So there has to be some Biden in this campaign.
"That's what she stands for, not concepts of a plan."
But some people have been waiting here for two days for this.
He's just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues.
It's just all there is to it.
Vice President Harris appeared on a live radio show in Detroit on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Today's rally comes as calls from Democrats asking President Biden to step down grow.
We don't know the answer to that question.
They like his fiscal policy.
"There is a community of people who recognize that, that you don't just have to pull the lever for Donald Trump because you've done so in the past and that there are other people out there who recognize the importance of electing Kamala Harris, even despite longstanding party identity."
"Well, for starters, no, this lead that she has a quotations, it's because of one poll, one poll that found Harris up by five points."
Nevada probably his.
"The ninth poll was conducted between September 20 and 24 by Beacon Research, Shaw and Company Research among 1,021 registered voters."

"These efforts, according to his thesis, have resulted in a noticeable improvement in the lives of individuals, and they stand in stark contrast to what he referred to as rhetoric without results on the side of the Republican Party that he was referring to."
Biden navigated to the center of the Democratic Party.
"Sadly, it does tend to lead in one direction, a very dark direction."
"Now, some people might argue, well, it's one data point."
"But if you're the Harris campaign, knowing that Biden was supposed to win Pennsylvania by six points at the same time back in 2020, you want to be up by four to five points at the bare minimum, not tied."
"Like, you're not running against Biden."
Get out there and make your voices heard.
They show Biden leading by one.
Here is what it is Politico is headline is Kamala Harris is Pennsylvania problem and Joe Biden's local ties and cultural roots kept him competitive in a culturally conservative Northeastern Pennsylvania Harris's prospects and the heavily Catholic working-class region there are dice here Now obviously she skipped the Al Smith dinner.

"Months after the work was done my daughter's blood work improved, the frequency of our headaches began to decrease and my dad's breathing had improved."
"And unfortunately, for Kamala Harris, every time that she does an interview, she makes our case for us."
And here's what I'll say.
"The decline of traditional manufacturing jobs, for instance, has altered voter priorities and preferences, prompting many to seek candidates who are attuned to their economic realities."
"Biden received 82% support in 2020, but right now Harris is looking at 59%."
The enemy from within.
"She's not downright awful, it seems, compared to Cara Mund, who would have been the worst choice."
Great question.
The state court is halting enforcement of a requirement that voters include accurate handwritten dates on envelopes used to submit mail-in ballots.
And why did you put the tape over Mike Pence's name there?
"But when I saw that list of the best names, the biggest names in national security and security generally and law enforcement, I said, this is a big story."
"And right now they're trying to limit our life, whether if it's speaking, whether if that's doing or whatever, within reason, you know, I mean, I believe this is America."
"Even 1% in Pennsylvania, if it's much closer than this Quinnipiac poll, if it's actually more of a toss up, what if Jill Stein is the reason that Donald Trump wins Pennsylvania and thus wins the election?"
"And the challenge, though, is that it's really hard to have a plan when, as President Biden has said, with 50 senators, with 50 Democratic senators, every single one of them is a president."
"I know hindsight is 2020, but looking back at it now, any idea what happened?"
"I'm from the outer banks, and we came up here."
So I think that a lot of people are reading into this type of stuff way too much and that's the way it is.

Because elections typically ramp up after Labor Day.
"This is Pennsylvania netted them 5,000 new voters."
"The really word, the word she wants to use there is a centrally planned command and control economy dictated by every, dictating every aspect of your life."

"Today, she's up by two."
And let me tell you something.
"While living Tennessee, you just registered to vote."
"Now the other interesting point with that 3.4 million number is that a lot of people have said wow this this race is really narrowed if you look at it you know Vice President a former Vice President Joe Biden had a really widely and it's now narrowed to about 68,000 votes but in this state you only need one tenth of one percent to have a recount so it's very very narrow so with 3.4 million votes that calculates out if I'm doing my math correctly to about 3400 votes would have to be between the two candidates before a recount would have what would happen here so that's what people are watching if that narrows even further but the one thing about Maricopa County that's also changed is that well this has been a reliably Republican area the demographics here have changed so you've had a lot of younger people move in from more liberal states like California they came out to vote you had more suburban women show up at the polls who voted for former Vice President Joe Biden and then you had the Latino population which has increased here tremendously just between 2018 and 2020 a hundred thousand Latinos had reached voting age so it's been a big shift in that demographic and many people think that the majority of the votes will go to former President former Vice President Joe Biden but we'll have to see so there's enough there's enough there to keep an eye out and people are anxious to get the results in so hopefully we'll have those by the end of the day today"
Phone use and texting are among the biggest culprits.
"It's definitely crazy You know to have people that wants to you know attack Trump and I'm gonna say this attack anybody No, you you literally I don't know what as far as like how far they going like, what are you charged with?"

And then the ballots come out.
"Well, a couple of things there."
"Joining me today is the Center Squares Pennsylvania reporter, Anthony Hennon."

That gets you pretty close to 270 right there.
But we really haven't seen much of him on the campaign trail since.
"I think the more he can stick to those issues, I think the better off that he is going to be as he goes forward."
Just look at their numbers in 2020.
47% voted for Donald Trump.
"It is much too close right now, but this is a scene outside of the Maricopa election center."
"Let me ask you about that, because I know you've been covering the Trump campaign for a long time."

"At 7 30 p.m. Eastern time tonight from a president Trump will take the stage right behind us here in Atlanta, Georgia for a speech on the economy."
"Yeah, I believe that Trump has turned it over to the states for the states to regulate it And I believe that was the best decision to make Were you happy to see Roe v. Wade be overturned on the heels of Trump's Supreme Court appointees?"

"GS strategy group, from September 19 to 25, surveyed for 170 for likely voters."
"And but in my audience, in my sphere, my world, you know, there's a lot of talk going on about this interview and what questions we'll be asking if it's as tough as it needs to be, because we've seen the CBS interview, the 60 Minutes, these these other interviews that get edited and put out."
"Guys, I read the same stuff that you guys read, but both these people are obviously deranged, radicalized, and it ain't good."

The buzz around Pennsylvania isn't just media hype.

"And just some context, the last two presidential races in Pennsylvania came down to 44,000 votes and 80,000 votes."

Please tell me he's okay.
"If somebody says, well, I'm thinking about voting for Trump because I remember the economy being pretty good, remind him why it was good."
We got Trump trash cans.
"We have the outside enemy and then we have the enemy from within and the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia and all these countries."
"We've already got thousands, tens of thousands of requests."
"It operates in Pennsylvania, where it's headquartered in my hometown of Pittsburgh, by the way, where the Steelers remain named after the steel industry."

Ain't nobody here voting for Kamala Harris.
The places where they can turn out the vote.
I love to see the grind.
And the solar panels that fade out and they don't have energy.
That was five days ago from the sitting president of the United States.
"Joe Delano, John Delano rather, joins us now."
And that path to breaking through might begin with answering the question posed to you in the first place.
"In other words, what is it you want to do as a non-citizen to risk the fact that someone determines that you voted as a non-citizen and then prosecution?"
But also the campaign says today is going to be focused on the economy and inflation.
This is very controversial.
"But you've been on the road for the last few days actually bringing what you guys do with the bulwark, bringing this perspective from Republicans, former Republicans, independents, onto the road to meet independent voters, to meet swing voters out there in some battleground states."
We know this for a fact.
And so people were more enthusiastic about Walz.
She's running behind where Biden was in the Northeast and Western Pennsylvania.
She doesn't need any Sunbelt states so very key there and You can see Pennsylvania is key because we're saying what Trump's slightly more likely to win It's these two Kamala.
We have to talk about the 2024 presidential election because Donald Trump has great news out of Pennsylvania.
"If the election were held today, of course, things can change in the next month."

Has he made mistakes?
"If he wins the presidential race in November, Biden and Trump's stance on the proposed deal coming as the two candidates face the heat of election year politics."
He's ranting and rambling until people get bored and leave his rallies.
There's also a Discord server for you to go ahead and join on the screen.

"If you had a family member who acted like that, just making stuff up, hurtful stuff, you might still love them, but you'd tell them you've got a problem, and you certainly wouldn't put them in charge of anything."

"Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
I don't wanna be talking about this.
"Because if you're losing Pennsylvania already, your pathway to the presidency is already old but gone."

"Pennsylvania is the center of the universe, said Cliff Maloney, who leads efforts to get Republican voters to vote by mail in the state."
"And so whether you harken back to the Donald Trump future, because he would say that's what he's delivering in the future or to a different vision of the future from Kamala Harris, I think both these candidates will need to tie that into their message this evening."

"Um, so I really hope five 38 has ends up having Harris win because imagine they actually do go with Trump and they're like, we got it right."
"So, you know, it's not like it's proof that Donald Trump's going to be in a lot of trouble, especially because spending even if he gets outspent, it's a presidential year, you know, high propensity in general."
I do not think we've ever had an election with candidates who understand freedom so differently.
"They were stumping for Harris earlier this week and they spent the majority of the time attacking Trump, calling him dangerous and despicable, divisive and tying into Project 2025, which to be clear is not his platform."
What about the specific counties and where these candidates are going to attack?
But the thing is I Think as we all know here it You know the polling aggregate does slightly favor Trump in Trump has unique point of strength here Cuz let's go to something like the 2000 election and you can see Gore was up for right 2004 Kerry was up two and a half 2008 Obama won by over 10 2012 by 5 so Trump's connection to the state with his economic policies Really is what drove him to victory a very narrow one against Hillary Clinton and even a loss that was still the most narrow in This century against Biden back in 2020.
How did you first meet her?
And this is one of your top sellers here?
The same thing former President Trump and his supporters are also calling for.
"So for example, you see this Insider Advantage poll here."

"Roadshow, part public relations tour, spreading the gospel of election security."
Everybody loved Donald Trump.
"Like, for example, you see LGBTQI Plus for Kamala Harris."
"What this is focused on, though, these efforts or this talk of the former president wanting to repeal this Act 77, this is an act that was passed in 2019, which was before the pandemic, that allowed for no excuse absentee voting, which means that anybody could vote by mail."
"And it's a key point because we're seeing President Trump really cut in to the Democrat Party's base with Arab Americans, with union workers, with black voters and Hispanic voters."
She has been making this clear for a long time.
So definitely 46% of the economy is good and excellent.
Kamala Harris received 50 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 44 percent.
"See 58-3, 56-7."
 Could you imagine renting an electric vehicle and driving from New York City to California?
"Coming up in moments, we'll have Donald Trump out in Georgia."
"I mean, that is that is the number one thing that she needs to penetrate between now and election day is really selling herself as I'm a good person and I can handle the economy."
"And at this point, you know, uh, Jamie Raskin put it quite appropriately when he called it electoral lunacy."
"We saw it at all of the events that we held, which all sold out in two seconds, and we had to have bonus grassroots events that we added on around it, where we could go out and meet people and have conversations with them, kind of hear about the outreach they're doing on the ground in their community, speaking to family members that are maybe still on the fence."
"That 5-point gap would mark the third straight cycle in which Texas' margin narrows, though it does still go down as leaning towards Trump here."
And then he goes on to say Oz believes in health care reform or whatever.
They're going to save our country.
And you should definitely use RCP.
"Fun fact, fun fact, more people are stealing your money."
"And then came another point where flank Franklin and Marshall College, which again is the in state in house pollster in Pennsylvania, one of the best pollsters in the state, showing Kamala Harris with a three point advantage."
Tim Walz has a five point positive.
" Good evening everyone, I'm Lindsay Davis."
"I'm, of course, talking about Catholic voters."
"Oh, that's great news."
They think the race is plateaued.
People like Kamala Harris trying to ride a crowd up doing all this jazz right here.
And what does that mean?
54% over the age of 50.
"Okay, let's see what's going on."
I said it was 16.
I do think Lisa Slotkin could do well.
We get everything.
"Bernie Sanders didn't campaign for Hillary Clinton, even though he's back."
And tonight there is a new poll from CBS News.
That's the best compliment that we can get.
And a decision handed down is the state is being hotly contested in the presidential contest.
We have the mail-in ballots that came in weeks ago.
"We will then finish the likely states, which will have 7 to 15 point margins of victory."
"So when the space to pre-elected sedition and politics is so narrow, I think that is why that's getting so much attention now and what we have a real problem."
"And that includes the power plant rule that came out in April, which would end the use of new natural gas power plants, unless they eliminate all their emissions, which is pretty much impossible."
"Here's the individual, by the way, who Donald Trump yells at and tells to lose weight as he's being stretchered out of the rally."
"Unlike other states with stable support for one particular party, Pennsylvania contains both Democratic-leaning urban areas and Republican-leaning rural areas."
"So the fact that they're not doing so well compared to 2022, you know, even taking into account the fact they're likely going to surpass their totals, that's a very low turnout election."
"Keep in mind, these races are going to be so close, Laura, so very, very close in eight or 10 states, maybe even now."
"Yeah, I think security mom sounds like boomer for Karens."
Kind of.
You are.
But still Republicans are continuing and even in some counties like Chester County that have been moving away from the Republicans that have been ancestrally Republican.
It was a mix of several things but Trump is still breaking records with the zombie vote and he technically does it again in Indiana.
"They are, you know, really, really good when it comes down to gauging political races, but sometimes they are wrong."
"Edwards explained that a longtime female friend in Omaha, who is featured in the picture, shared the image with him."
"So we'll have to see, guys."
How can I make the most money?
"He poured $75 million over the last three and a half months of his own money into a political action committee that is not only just doing the ground game on behalf of the former president in states like Wisconsin, so actually boots on the ground and paying for people and bodies to knock on doors and turn out the vote, encouraging people to refer friends for $47 to be involved in the election and to say, hey, maybe this person's a Trump voter, but they might not vote."
But that's okay.
"Oh yeah, and then this is like a good representation."
"Yeah, that's really scary right there."
I really believe she has no appeal to these voters whatsoever.
How's everybody doing?
"All right, so let's talk politics here."
I'm not.
"I mean, one, it's not going to overturn the results of the election."
"Apart from a very brief moment at the Democratic Convention when she peaked, Kamala Harris never led in Arizona."
I've had residents come when we first pushed the first ceasefire resolution for what's unfolding across Gaza to speak to the calamity that has struck their family.
"Just last week, I mean, I talked about this."
And I'm just going to show you how important it is.
Fox News viewers objectively think the issue of illegal immigration is a problem that Biden paused that needs to be fixed.
"So today we'll be looking at a 0.5 victory for Kamala Harris where it's currently at right now, despite a huge win for Donald Trump."
A push for voters to cast their votes early in a battleground state that will be critical for the candidate.
They want him dead.
Kamala Harris is ready to do the job.
They're not going to crack.
So what's what's the date?
"They interviewed 45% were Democrats, 44% were Republicans, and only 9% were independents, that's very interesting to me, all right?"
"And that's the real big question because even though the Democrats are losing voters, those who are registering now as non-party affiliates or non-affiliated voters, which is right now the largest chunk of people registering in Pennsylvania, they seem to be becoming more Democratic."
"One reason for that, although the votes for her and for that are connected in some way, and you might think, well, she has a big advantage because she does on the issue for people who say it's a major factor."
And that's going to be harder without the votes of Pennsylvania's energy workers.
"But what I try and do, what I know Kamala Harris and others try and do is go out and also earn the support of the individuals in that organization."
Mm.
They weren't affected by COVID because they don't watch TV and it's just a really amazing man.
"And I think maybe I'll have to take some to Kamala Harris for every time she does a softball interview, she wants to wear some body armor."
And when you asked him for evidence of the struggle that he's saying?
"Listen, I had to come and talk about the situation that happened earlier today with Trump."
And some of them are distinctly partisan.
"We saw that former President Trump was there just a couple weeks ago, August 17th, in Wilkes-Barre."
"But they will give, you know, polls that have far more red flags a total pass if they fit the narrative."
"A history of, for example, something that still exists that I've worked on to address, which is racial bias and home appraisals."
Can you tell us how this impacted you and your family?
It's running ahead of Kamala Harris.
"See the man with the wall, stand up."
All four of these lifelong Republicans voted for Nikki Haley for president in the Arizona Republican primary.
"And now they're saying Trump is the worst, but Trump has surrounded himself by really good people today."

Why does Erie matter so much?
"I'm the biggest trout in the pod, and I'm the biggest trout in me."
"I mean, I kind of looked at my classes and went back to bed."

We're going to take their factories and we had it really rocking four years ago.
"So that's why he thinks, I wonder if people are voting for Kamala Harris because she's hotter than me."
"I mean, right before they went to the DNC in Chicago, they weren't in Philly or Pittsburgh."
"Anyway, go ahead, please."
So you won't defend the re talk about that.
"Wow, AWOL, away without leave."
"However, crucially, his margin in 2020 was slimmer than it was in 2016 when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 19 points."
And that's how you got in the building.
Thank you for tuning in.
No offense to them.
"Back in 2020, he only had 44%."
"Like this video down below, comment down below, subscribe to the channel, hit the bell for notifications."
You still have some competitive races going on here.
But rank and file labor laborers in Pennsylvania union members are almost always gun owners.
They just see people.
"Welcome to the Morning Agenda, WITF's daily news podcast, where the only agenda is you."
"Thanks, Nnedi."
And so that's what we got out of President Trump with three weeks to election day here.
"OK, you say."
And I can speak to that with with absolute certainty.
I shared this with our vice president during her 2022 visit and it was so great hearing the passion and concern in her voice speaking on how diligently she and the administration is working to make sure that all households achieve the goal of having access to clean drinking water and lead-free paint.
"Unfortunately, that was under his administration."
But the question is reassuring people that she's on top and that she has specific policies that people want to hear about.
It was it was odd to say the least.
"But this is basically a Trump sales tax that could cost the average family almost $4,000 a year."
"But here's this Arizona Republic, Arizona Republic reporter, Jen Fifield, who sees the ballot counters all holding blue pens while they're recounting the ballots under the watchful eye of the cyber ninja guy who's been a online promoter of the QAnon conspiracy and all of the craziest stuff in the stop the steal movement."
"But I thought the vice president did a great job, both laying out her vision and also prosecuting the case against Donald Trump, showing the clear contrast, particularly on the issue of abortion and the fundamental freedom for women to be able to make decisions over their own bodies."
"And she's such an authentic, nice, warm person."
He bragged about it.
"Okay, she's a Democrat too."
"I don't have these problems, he says."
We have real problems.
We have to get the resources to the border to get the job done.
So something caught me by surprise as I work to set up this story.
Like what's been happening in Florida?
"Mr. Craig Blais, thank you for the Super Chat."
"""'He also has a Fulton County mugshot, ""'his own sneaker line and three baby mamas."
I was at those events.
He worked at McDonald's as well.
"So I'm not sure that Cleveland Cliffs coming in with a basically saying, we'll buy this at a bargain basement price."
But that's not true.
"I think in my heart of hearts, that's what I would rather be."
The president has been struck.
"Now Shapiro was on the VP shortlist in part because of his ability to win statewide races, his skill on the stump and the importance of Pennsylvania in this year's presidential race."
And that is more problematic.
We're going to run through this pretty quick.
So what was the deal with that?
"No improvement in Texas, no improvement in Florida, no improvement in Ohio, no improvement in many of these other states."
"She is a San Francisco Democrat that is again further left than the average Democrat in, in my home state."
And it just seems that the appearance looks like he's abandoning his voters to go after these Republican voters.
"So what would a the question is, I'm going to bring it up again."
McClelland's comments resurrecting the scandal provoked blowback from Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman Cherie Street and other party officials who support the governor.
"Look, you've got to give Trump credit, right?"
Hold that in your head.
So what should we make of these early returns?
So that's why Pennsylvania is so important.
"So this time around, his campaign is hoping to increase support for him wherever possible."
And there has to be a law against it.
They are blocking access and they're also escorting people out.
"I know a lot about the election, but other reporters might have caught other things in there."
And that's something that's important to take into consideration.
And then all of a sudden there's a weird convergence towards like five points.
"And now to come along and say that the government has the right to tell you or you as a woman what you can do with your body, I have a problem with that."
"Same pollster, same group of people, same methodology, Trump plus five turned into Harris plus two."
"In Michigan, Harris 50, Trump 45."
This is a group that are traditionally Democratic voters.
But here Donald Trump is saying he cooperated more.
Good to have you back.
A second Democrat elected official in the state described Lew as AWOL.
"But this also comes as our CBS News polling from this weekend shows that the script has been flipped in the last couple weeks since the last debate that Donald Trump is now seen as in the red, no pun intended, on having a weakness among voters about who voters see as the most competent and able-bodied to be president."
It's like 19 days.
I think that's the lesson they've learned.
"Yes, some of them are mad about my hair."
"We will need to see a few more, but one poll nonetheless."
"But again, the liars, the grifters, the folks that want us divided one from another, they're going to capitalize on this same lie that they've been using year in and year out."
What was the exact word they used?
"Because if even Josh Shapiro couldn't save her, she's in deep trouble."
"And so I think that's what you're hearing from folks who are going towards a third party candidate, be it Stein or someone else."
They said the whole enterprise was illegal.
Absolutely huge.
I thought it would be fascinating.
And this is something that happens across the country.
Every state is a border state.
Joe Biden open convention.
It's the most important.
I just don't think it's going to happen before the 2024 election.
"All right, so it seems we're at the point in time right now where every move by every candidate really reveals some strategy after the debate, where's Kamala Harris headed?"
He believes that he is running for office to serve the people.
"Republicans voted in support of passing this, and it was signed into law in 2019."
I was on the ground in Pennsylvania covering this for the primary.
And that's what he said about Kathy Barnett.
"I don't know, it could be one reason."
"He held a town hall meeting where he's, he just, let me explain, because I've done a lot of town hall meetings."
She's an M. Wickel.
"We've called on those refiner, refiners to operate safely, but quickly come back online."
That is not good for Harris one bit.
We're still a retail state.
"You have to win through Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin."
"And I said, let's do it."
She's amazing She helped me in for my own debate and she's going to be absolutely prepared for that And she's going to be prepared for anything But I do fundamentally believe that she's going to go great Trump is going to be strange and he's going to say a lot about landish things But at the end of the day I think the debate is kind of we're going to move on past that and we're going to return to a very very close race in Pennsylvania and across across the nation and a lot of the a lot of the Critical states what should VP Kamala Harris in your opinion talk about in the state of Pennsylvania to win that state?
I'll show you what the numbers show right here.
"An Archives Inspector General official said the agency declined to comment on, quote, ongoing work."
He knows what to say.
And then all day today we've been crossing Pennsylvania and it's been a track.
"Those are really important and we cover those too, but this show in particular focuses on this and I wanted to take a trip across America to talk to everyday people and see how they are feeling after a chaotic summer politics with the assassination attempt against the former president Donald Trump, Joe Biden dropping out and then of course Kamala Harris getting the nomination and moving forward."
That seems to be thriving.
This consolidation of support can be crucial in building a strong and unified base as the election approaches.
These are really good numbers coming out and we will see if that does end up holding.
But I'm seeing in the areas of the state that can generate big turnout that historically have had high percentage of the voters in their area turnout.
I don't think there's much of a reason for concern in that department.
What does that mean under our system?
Let me make one more.
"But I think Trump is playing very smart politically, saying he's for exceptions, he said they ended the debate."
"I mean, McCormick is a is a candidate who's already lied to the people about where he lives."
"He's a little bit more aggressive She's aggressive in her way, but I think she'll be aggressive in the next term So Trump over Harris for you Harris over Trump for most of you what I will tell you 75 days now until election day."
Other segments of Florida's Hispanic electorate are more divided.
She's ahead in Arizona and North Carolina and narrowing his lead in Nevada and Georgia.
"US, Vice President Kamala Harris is gaining ground in key Sun Belt swing states, according to the latest NYT-Ciena college polls."
I remember being at the RNC.
"There are a lot of things that would similarly fell, these like invalid octogenarian presidential candidates, which we have too."
The significance of this poll lies not only in the close numbers but also in the broader context of voter sentiment in Pennsylvania.
I want to ask about what issues you think we'll see Walz really focus on during this campaign.
"for decades really and for the first Let's see Starting in 1988, which is when I wrote my first political stuff to the inquirer from 1988 to 2004 which is 16 years Doing the math."
It's just trash for your pleasure.
Who's going to win?
We've had a historic pandemic that wrecked havoc on communities and businesses.
Kamala Harris received 50% of the vote and Donald Trump 47%.
Are you concerned about safety and security there today?
"Um, and it's dangerous for democracy."
That right there.
I really just don't be reacting to him.
They will literally do anything like a few stage.
I can hear the yelling behind you Scott.
"Cafe Versailles in Little Havana, as you know, it is a stopping ground for every presidential candidate and really shapes the narrative on that issue as well."
"I felt, I feel as though words were being weaponized against people that went against, that go against the status quo."
"Then of course in Wisconsin, they're effectively tied Harris 48, 47."
Are you addicted to testifying?
"Jean-Pierre defended the vice president by highlighting her achievements over the past three and a half years, particularly on economic issues and the border crisis."
He believes it 100 percent and he is in love with our country.
We've stayed in touch throughout the years.
In fact one woman I visited with told me that when her backyard floods she can hear sewage flowing underneath her floorboards and as a result too many communities across the south we've seen a rise in infections like hookworm which are basically people nodding tiny parasites that burrow into the skin and cause fever and nausea and abdominal pain so this is a serious issue it is a serious issue with serious health implications not to mention just basic points about what we need to do to address inequities.
"And so things like that that maybe are difficult to track with economic data that people do see on a day-to-day basis, especially, again, in an area where we're used to being known as a low cost of living area, and it doesn't feel like that anymore."
And Harris lost the poll by two points.
Quinnipiac had Trump losing seniors by like three.
"What are you hearing about our current president, President Biden?"
So people were talking about it.
Anything worth having is worth fighting for.
It sounds like you they feel that you really gas is much better than the electric for cooking.
So I have so many questions.
"And the reality is with vote by mail is that you just need time to track, find out and get those ballots in."
This is pretty highly unlikely.
"It makes me feel like I'm in a taxicab, begging the driver to keep his eyes on the road."
So they filed a complaint.
There are so many people are watching across the country.
Was that an honest thing to say?
No one knows.
"Well, yeah, the Democrats have not won it since 2008 and they have constantly poured money in there to see if they can, you know, utilize the demographic changes in the makeup of the electorate similar to what they were able to accomplish in Georgia."
"But the one constant is, Erie was, is, and looks like will continue to be a kind of 50-50 county."
Trump's.
That's their goal.
Niggas is not studying niggas niggas isn't studying JFK shooter they're studying John Hinckley.
I've played lots of games offline.
"So pretty much everything I've seen the past few days have been, has been amazing for Trump."
But either way we're gonna get into this.
"At different points in time, even leading up to the announcement that Joe Biden was leaving the race, 17 percent was the delta between unfavorable and favorable across the nation."
"Your company is always, always appreciated."
"And when asked about Republican comments that she is a DEI hire, Trump deflected the conversation and asked the journalists to define DEI, which she did repeatedly."
We have a real opportunity.
"First of all, obviously everything is very expensive, and I want to be able to at least buy a house in the future and have a future and have family and everything, and just with Donald Trump and then obviously all the immigration and everything."
Not all Trump parades are made equal.
"Yeah, well, although Chuck Schumer would probably be very glad to see this happen."
"But she is now giving us a laundry list of things that she'll do in order to support black men in America, including money for new homeowners."
They stop and they jostle with him on the street.
"So the focus on Pennsylvania at this time is critical because of everything that we have seen, but also in terms of this law."
Nobody liked her.
"Well, they talk about this woman, Mariel Joy Kornblith Martin."
"But it also allows Democrats to move forward to say, we're going to take a vote, we get people lined up on that vote, and then we go, and everybody knows where everybody stands, and we see where we can get later on, which, at this point, even though it doesn't seem like these bills are going to pass, reporting coming out suggesting that there may be some bipartisan agreement on changing this Electoral Count Act of 1887, which would prevent something like a vice president being able to, say, go in and say that he has authority to overturn electoral votes."
"We've also knew, we also have new information about the last time that Laundrie saw his parents before he vanished."
"Well, see, it's weird."
"And my experience, and it's 40 years now, Republicans appear to be less likely to answer the phone or to respond to surveys."
"If they can't get over this and get through it, they'll lose again."
"Historically, mail-in ballots have been a significant source of democratic votes, and any reduction in the number of valid ballots could favor Trump's campaign."
"But again, so far, we've tried to just keep a low profile because we don't want to antagonize the situation."
"If only Andrew Jackson had gotten to know more Cherokee or Chickasaw people, he'd never have signed the Indian Removal Act, right?"
"Political watchers are now waiting for the much-touted October surprise, which could potentially tip the balance in the favor of either Trump or Harris drastically."
"Now, is it possible there could be a polling miss in favor of Harris, I guess."
"Sean, let's let's start with that."
Y'all know how I feel about this.
"Who are people of color who are sold on their message, you know, just do your own research Try not to be so biased try not to trust and everything that you hear on TV do your own research And once you start doing your own research and going down that rabbit hole You can make an honest opinion based off of that, you know And I feel like everybody deserves a fair chance, but Trump definitely has my attention when it comes to certain things that he talks about and I just like how direct he is and how you know, you know not so He doesn't just bow down to the media and I like that if Kamala Harris were to be elected She'd be the first black female president."
"We have an AK-47 inside and people say, you know what, let's just and I don't, I knew about an AK-47 from a few weeks ago."
"Can't stream the debate, but maybe I'll live tweet it."
There was a pretty large one.
"Now, I will say we did not see this strong of a run up in our daily numbers whatsoever."
And so I think it's going to be incredibly close.
"I'm great, okay."
"This morning, the Cook Political Report moved three battleground states that are key, Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada, from lean Republican to toss-up, citing increased Democratic energy and unity around Kamala Harris."

"Haha, that was a great one buddy."
" Every single week before the election, we are on the road for our series, three meals talking to voters over breakfast, lunch, and dinner, three squares."
Always happy to.
I think he would compliment her.
And he's not being transparent with the voters.
All of them appear to be carrying rifles and handguns.
They argue the county election officials are able to tell whether ballots were cast in time because they're scanned and timestamped upon approval.
I got to be aggressive and help them grow their incomes.
"When you stand for freedom, whether it be to make decisions about your own body or love who you love, you fight for those things."
What do we know about how she's preparing?
"Hell, he doesn't even need Georgia at that point."
What is this?
I'm not going to say how you should vote but There's maybe two or three weeks left to register and Get a mail-in ballot if that's easier But this is the most important election of my lifetime And since I've been around a lot longer than you guys it is certainly the most important election of your lifetime So let's make it work All right Thank you so much and thank you to everybody watching if you want to check out some of Dick Pullman's writing you can find it at Dick Pullman dot net.

"The latest poll in Nevada via Siena College with the New York Times is Trump leading Harris by 1 percentage points, with 48% of support to 47%."
I'm done.
A riot.
"Yeah, Lillie, I had the same reaction, which was that that was a very notable poll."
"Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley won more than 16 percent of the vote in the Republican contest, even though she's, of course, no longer in the race."
And that's a good thing.
And I think Mark Burnovich now has some real problems on his hands because he's the base of the parties that is turning against him as a result of President Trump's attack upon.
"Good to be with you again, John."
Tell us his sort of state of mind.
"Your take on that rally here in Glendale, have you ever seen anything like that before?"
"OK, he couldn't be bought."
What started out as a fatherly lecture came back to bite back Obama.
"Then a couple weeks ago, he tells women he'll be their, quote, protector."
We know how he gets people to go to the polls and also the independent support that I think Trump will get in these swing States over Harris.
"And if you look at Pennsylvania politically, you know, Democrats did very well there in 2022, in part because Republicans had sort of like uniquely poor candidates in Dr. Oz and what's the other dude's name who ran for governor?"
"Today is Wednesday, August 7th, 2024, and today we are gonna be talking specifically about the state of Pennsylvania and two new batches of polls that show Kamala Harris in the advantage, according to a Democratic pollster, and tied, according to a Republican pollster, in a massive, massive shift relative to where President Biden was standing against President Trump in this election, in this battleground state."
"It doesn't help with Obama, what he just did."
"You look at Pennsylvania, your home state, and you say Democrats are trying to defend their turf."
Let's show those numbers because it is striking.

"That Kamala Harris's improvements are tangible, noticeable and are now being reported on by not only Democratic pollsters, but Republican pollsters, even in some of the most competitive states or Republicans desperately want to maintain their advantage."
There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking.
I stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.
"When President Biden and Vice President Harris went to Georgia to give remarks, to push for this voting rights legislation, activists, voting rights activists who are a huge, have a strong hold in Georgia and are very significant in Georgia, refused to show up, many of them, saying that words weren't enough, they needed a plan."
There was the smile and the laugh.
And that's what our election is about.
And Jill Stein is still in there.
"Okay, let me go over to let me go over to Twitter really quick."
"With a little more than one month to go before the November election, Kamala Harris' presidential campaign is working to get Republicans to vote for Democrats."
"And that means no blade movement, more comfort before and after shaving."
"This time we have a total of 7 to look at including Franklin and Marshall, Quinnipiac, The Hill Emerson, NYT Siena, Rasmussen, Mullenburg, College and Susquehanna."
"To Bowers, I understand that as you flew from Phoenix to Washington yesterday, you reflected upon some passages from a personal journal that you were keeping in December 2020 while all this was taking place."
I'm Eric Fink news for Tucson
"Maybe it's a two point miss, maybe a three point miss, especially in Pennsylvania."
"He's like, does your family remember what I told them?"
You're going to base your decision on that.
"You just heard from former American Express CEO, former President Bill Clinton, and of course Vice Presidential Nominee Tim Walts laying out the Democratic Party's economic messaging this week at the DNC in Chicago."
You know how annoying he's going to be now?
"And I understand why he was angry about the call, because it disrupted a narrative that he wanted to put in place so that he could steal the election."
We have to listen to what he says.
"You know, then we just got a lot of custom shirts, you know, nice soft styles."
"Kamala Harris leads the Empire State today by just 13.5% in the polling, hence this is not a flutter."
"In fact, she's managed to close the gap among white voters, trailing Trump by only three points nationally compared to Biden's larger 12-point gap in 2020."
"Right now, they would probably go on record to send you Barry Goldwater as well."
"Tim Wall said, well, we're not mad and we want to be compassionate for immigrants."
"According to a survey by the Brennan Center, 38% of local election officials have experienced threats, harassment, or abuse for doing their jobs, 38%."
It's called an economic opportunity agenda for black men.
And that does appeal with a lot of people.
There is a visible Secret Service detail.
Some of their Amish elders are against it.
"And when considering the poll locations here, Trump leads in an astounding majority."
You've been a senator since 2007.
I think it's working for Trump.
The Biden administration also plans to roll out new measures to combat gender-based violence.
But what's going to happen is this is what people say when they answer the polls.
He's a very important person.
"He has, quote, concepts of a plan."
You're a very popular governor and you're a Democratic governor in a state that is a pretty closely politically divided state.
"This is a polly market, a betting market."
"Frankly, I'm going to say this in all sincerity."
But I'd rather run against her.
And what this shows is that Biden he wasn't even running against anybody.
"And in fact, there's numbers that back that up in Cambria County, where Donald Trump is speaking right now since 2019, when New York Times found it, I thought this was interesting, that they have actually six percent fewer jobs from 2019 to 2023."
But he's noting this because it resonates.
I appreciate the opportunity to talk.
"And it included traffickers, women."
It's too expensive.
"He can't admit what he really is, which is a sad elderly con man farting on stage."
And they actually have a totally different perspective than what you thought they would have had.
They've gone silent.
Every single one of them and most of them are shifting four to five points towards Trump.
Harris finished six points ahead of Trump in this poll.
"What I will say is we're seeing a lot of support right now for President Trump on college campuses, particularly among the young men."
"Although if you look at the 2020 polls in Pennsylvania, it is true that he led by over 7 percentage points in October."
Has any of that changed?
"Paralegal, Milvus Teresa explained last month when we visited, she's switching to Trump in 2024, frustrated by the rising cost of living and running a business in Reading."
"First of all, I really appreciate that question."
We're just alienating ourselves against Russia even more and escalating tensions.
That's what you have to deal with when you're looking at this endorsement.
"OK, so we're seeing some potential movement there."
"It was mostly Trump, just huge leads for Joe."
"Uh, there's good numbers in, in Pennsylvania with their fake firewall."
The damage is so bad and so it's been done.
"What up, what up, what up, y'all?"
I've seen a lot of these cities as I travel.
He has that background that can appeal and talk to voters from those segments of the population that want to hear from folks from that line of work.
Nobody's getting convinced that includes my family.
"This man was allowed to set up for a full 10 minutes, get five shots out before they caught him."
I don't know that we've had a full recount of ballots ever.
"But I will say again, the general public is something that is really a tough nut to crack in regards to a lot of these people."
They're not going to run the country.
But also he represented a sprawling rural district in southern Minnesota for six terms in the U.S. House.
"It's a big, big part of the Biden-Harris agenda to stop the use of fossil fuels over the next several decades through electrifying our transportation fleet, our power plants, our buildings, everything."
I'm hopeful.
The reason they did that was because that's the purest form of propaganda.
"So we can sort of hold two things at the same time, which is that polling is our best tool for understanding the horse race."
I'm glad that it's a female.
Remember Biden won it last time.
It's bought and sold already.
"It's completely unfair to have people coming from all over the world, not just Latin America, Iran, Russia, China."
Let's stick to this.
"Then she goes on to Michigan, then to Wisconsin."
So keep that in mind as well.
"And so Kamala went on to Charlemagne the Gods podcast, Breakfast Club Power Hour, 105.1 FM."
It'll be counted quickly.
"Make sure to subscribe, hit the bell and join the channel."
Voter fraud never happens.
"Competing with the crowd and the music around her, we did doing a gamely, as always."
"And they still won the in-person early vote, but not by much."
And they're so enthusiastic.
And I want to dispel any myths right here and now that there is no ground game.
"Now the Harris campaign provided a list of politico of several examples of surrogate events aimed at engaging voters of color, actress America and Ferrera and others are all going to be there."
"She's previously held major positions in the state of California as Attorney General, and so on."
It has been debunked multiple times from journalists to experts.
It's a good question.
"We need a stern president, somebody that's healthy, somebody that can speak for the people."
Later he served in the Marines.
Listeners can keep up with this story and more at the center square dot com.
"New York Times, Biden plus six."
Like when I'm not exaggerating when I say this is Def Con one for Dems.
"In percentage of the lowest income earners, those earning less than two thirds of the median income had grown four percentage points from 25% to 29% of the population over that same period though."
"I did get a little bit nervous when we have found out that Trump was gonna be running again, but when they had kind of did that switcheroo and had Kamala come in, it kind of gave a lot more hope for what was coming."
The curator later told the Kansas City Star the whole heist took less than a minute by the time the security guard got back to where those guys had broken in.
"Alright, so Kamala Harris wins the electoral college when she wins the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
"I mean, the Republican Party has done this for so long."
"Jess, before she left Georgia, she sat for an interview with Reverend Al Sharpton."
"As both campaigns make their final push, the outcome in Pennsylvania will likely be decided by a combination of voter turnout, enthusiasm, and how each candidate navigates the key issues like the economy, fracking, and the future of democracy."
"Then Donald Trump just rambles on about telling rich people that made some he doesn't like, that they want him to take over telephone companies."
It is good to be back.
They found Trump up by two.
May January 6th sound like it was Woodstock.
We didn't see any riot.
Many times of literal children.
"So Arizona, I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard?"
For the ladies.
You would expect more Republicans leaving the party.
Why why if I get an abortion if a woman gets an abortion?
What do you think about the Haitians?
Part of the message has to do with immigration.
You might wonder what they had in common.
These are not good things for her.
"However, Trump's having difficulty sticking to that message."
"But okay, whatever."
"Hump day, and we'll talk again tomorrow."
Let me know how you also doing in the comments.
What are you going to do if you're president?
We've talked about it and we'll continue to talk about it.
That was our first.
"Yeah, I don't know."
Election comes down to Pennsylvania.
And we got another tie.
P.U.
You just need to.
"These economic shifts have reshaped the priorities and concerns of the electorate, influencing their political leanings and candidate preferences."
And so folks want to continue to see a bright economic future and they want a leader who's going to fight for that future.
"I thought when I was here, I was family."
"And number two, we're referring you to the Attorney General's office for potential prosecution."
Who's she trying to reach?
"I was just going to ask you ambiently from where you're standing with your own, with your own ears."
But it's not just Kamala Harris that's getting smashed by media.
"Last question, Selena."
"It's going neck and neck, like you're saying, for the time being."
That's what I'm talking about.
They're going to be involved directly in the war.
"Right now the talk is as Pennsylvania goes, so goes the nation."
"Mike Vance, Oz, has been pushing the endorsement."
"It's, you know, it is what it is, but all the betting saying Trump's going to win."
"Now, they headed out with a lot of important questions, and as you might imagine, they listened to a lot of political opinions."
"Hit subscribe, everybody."
"If you go back and look at the Real Clear Politics polling average, the last eight or so polls that were conducted, I should say, since the debate on September 10th, shows that Harris was up as much as five points, according to Quinnipiac."
But you know how Wikipedia is there in the bag for Kamala Harris and they're going to purposely be so they're going to purposely be slow about it.
"Nice to meet you, Charlotte."
"Well, 2016, during that campaign, he mocked a disabled person."
It will be close.
"And so that could be a slight headwind for Joe Biden, seeing concerns about Democratic governance among more moderate suburbanites in the Pittsburgh area."
"Like, hey, Trump, go back to your greatest hits."
"And over the weekend, he talked about elite forces, National Guard, other things in our country being deployed to not only deport those suspected of or charged with or implicated in crimes, but others as well."
"Noah, meantime, former President Donald Trump is set to make his second trip to southern Arizona in less than 30 days."
"Like half of that is completely untrue, at least before he ran for Senate."
"Tim Walz is popular, but so is she."
"Even the ones who were once respectable, like Governor Sununu in New Hampshire, just to mention one, there are not many Liz Cheney's out there."
That's a four-point swing.
"Trump's appointments of conservative justices to the Supreme Court have been popular with these voters, and his stance on social issues has helped solidify his support in the state."
And he'll never support the Protecting the Right to Organize Act to protect working men and women so you can organize the union.
But that was coming down.
Our coverage begins at 7 o'clock on air and wherever you get your streaming content.
"They saw numbers of 90s of thousand, 60s of thousand, 40s of thousand, the ballots drop into Donald Trump's category and then quickly come out verbatim."
We see the Harris campaign focusing on a swing county.
Her willingness to speak directly to a community is a sign of respect.
But people need to keep going and make sure that everybody gets out and votes because that's the only way that we win this thing.
Do you feel like you're better off than you were several years ago personally?
So their original criticism was that he didn't keep everything shut down.
"And I said, do you have their names?"
"They say to me in my show, why would he stand up after getting shot at?"
They're going to vote on their gut and their heart.
Do you think fracking is like central to the minds of voters in Pennsylvania?
Go do your job.
"Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, we've got Wisconsin, we've got North Carolina."
This is a security failure of epic historic proportions that there was some type of explosive noise.
Let's see here.
"Although, I guess to be fair, in 2016, Trump only won Michigan by like 10,000 votes."
Biden needs to win all of them assuming that the States in red end up going for Trump at the end of the day and assuming that the States in blue end up going for Biden at the end of the day.
"Of course, though, Trump won here in 2016 before Biden went back in 2020 and polls show that he has a pretty good shot."
He has that ability to do it.
Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote while Donald Trump received 50%.
They dropped a poll with Trump leading by three percentage points.
We got two old geezers that are running.
To.
They're literally number one.
Those animals are worshiping the shooter like they did George Floyd.
"There was a large group, probably about 200 people who came between here and the state capital, which is about a half mile away."
Like what are you doing?
He was a joke.
That's so good.
Shut it down.
"So, Mr. Tough Guy on China, except when he can make a few bucks, hawking his Trump edition Bibles."
"I mean, we know the guy likes Big Macs and Filet-O-Fish and he's used the word love to describe the way he feels about the food there before."
That's why it's a big deal.
"Yeah, it's become much more of a swing state than it used to be in part because the divide between the Blue Philadelphia and the red rural areas Has become much more pronounced number one and the second thing is that the suburban counties around?"
"And and so I don't think he takes it because it takes away his opportunity to not only finish out his first term and go into his second term, but also to prove himself to the people of the state."
We've got a lot of close Senate races.
So that's also a key county to look at.
I didn't I had no idea that you stayed in all that.
"Many people didn't think it was appropriate for you to be here today, Scott said."
I just want you to understand that means that we don't know.
It's a closed primary too.
Hillary Clinton was predicted to win the state by eight point two point two in 2016.
"Well, do you care more about the election now?"
For then Barack Obama to take his elitist ass.
And then the calibration or the certification of those ballots is covered up by the machine.
"It's okay to not trust journalists and experts, but from widely disparate ideological sources."
So so creative.
Did you really have it?
"You know, I think as Democrats, we have a job to do to get out all across Pennsylvania to talk about our vision for this country, how we're going to create an economy that works for everyone, how we are going to make our community safer and how we're going to create ladders of opportunity for everyone."
Former President Barack Obama will be on stage here in western Pennsylvania in a fieldhouse at the University of Pittsburgh in just over an hour.
We lost all these jobs.
The Georgia and DC cases likely aren't happening before the election either.
Can I have a hug?
"Because while I appreciate that you've been willing to speak out against the lies being spewed by Donald Trump, the fact that you're still voting for him makes your defense of your Haitian constituents ring pretty hollow."
I'm going to be up in the state of Pennsylvania doing my best to help mobilize people.
"This is hotly debated across the community, whether it be at the Arab community, the Muslim community or the anti-war community at large."
Why are y for this event?
"And this is, you know, a pretty quick turnaround from him sending this letter to Texas Governor Greg Abbott to just last night."
"But Dr. Oz has been that guy in Trump's circle, extended circle for a while."
That's not my place to speak on that.
"And in the United States, there's a pretty big push by some groups and politicians to end the use of fossil fuels."
"What he's trying to do, specifically in this case, unclear, but we know he's been trying to sow doubts and suggest that he's not getting proper attention or credit for the size and popularity of his campaign."
There it is.
"But of course, she's a beautiful woman, so we'll leave it at that, right?"
"I was recently talking to Karl Rove, and he was reminiscing about how many states as recently as the 2000 election they were playing in, either on offense or on defense, places like Tennessee or Kentucky that we no longer consider a West Virginia, even part of the dialogue."
"The vice president, Kamala Harris, insist she won't ban fracking today despite claiming otherwise back in 2019."
It is about values.
Social security should not be taxed.
The president calling on Congress to come back to session.
"I mean, he's that guy."
"And Ari, what I'm saying is I think by case by case, I don't think in the case of January 6th, as much as the micro details about any specific incident on January 6th."
Dr. Oz is a man who truly believes in Make America Great Again or the MAGA movement.
So The sum total of all this is that when you add up all the demographics and all the votes It becomes almost like a toss-up.
We are surrounded by thousands and thousands and thousands of our fellow Americans who are looking forward to November the 5th and returning America to our American citizens.
"Cause he, you know, Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania said he was weird that he hugged the flag."
I do not take any.
"I would thank you for coming to my YouTube channel, but I know how brilliant it is."
How can you spin this?
Still lost a statewide statewide vote because H.W.
Oh we like Trump he represents our values and I Think he's gonna make America great again.
Trump is seen as the more trusted candidate on economic issues.
Did anybody see the Bryson D'Chambeau thing?
This is a classic cooperation agreement and Jenna Ellis fits the profile of the classic cooperator way back many months ago when she was first charged in the Georgia case.
"The point is, I was just picturing it."
"But more than that, actually, if this got into the wrong hands, it would provide information on sensitive law enforcement activities, law enforcement personnel that could put these operations at risk."
"Secretary Hobbs, I've had bill collectors in my youth less aggressive than what we've been seeing from the Trump administration here."
These are places in some of them he had pretty tight margins.
"I'm here to tell you, and this is based on Cliff Maloney."
That would give Trump a win.
We will continue to follow the story closely as more developments unfold.
"And if after you've gone through that and the folks who are unconvinced say, yeah, I don't know, I still like him, then you then I think you have to then say, yeah, but what about character?"
"Well, first of all, I don't think I've ever been asked a question in such a horrible way."
I cracked.
Those those pollsters suck.
"No, I highly doubt someone that became a Republican the last two months is going to vote for Kamala Harris."
Lifelong resident Carlos Diaz grew up with the lights of the Bethlehem Steel Plant.
"You might as well write your own name in, sir, rather than voting for Kamala."
So that's going to be a challenge in all those smaller counties that will actually make the difference in this race.
It's so good to see you.
"The music, nah, the music is crazy."
"But before you praise State Senator Bartolotta too much, keep in mind that she is not only a Republican, even after the things he said about Charleroi and its good, hardworking people who are doing their best to take care of their families, she's also still a Trump supporter."
Quinnipiac.
"5.7 million, 5.8 million views in 21 minutes."
I think that's her goal tonight.
Why do they need special protections?
"Before we let you go, gender gap."
"And I'm just baffled that suddenly the police are the bad guy, and the January 6 prisoners are the good guys and should be pardoned."
"Oh, God, I'm on it."
"It's been brewing, it's been gaining, it's been building, and it only continues to build."
I know all about the marbles.
Meanwhile Trump has a different problem.
So it could basically just maintain right and RFK Jr. at that rally endorsing Trump.
This is a health care issue.
"You know, Judge Patricia McCullough is saying showed a wholesale abandonment of common sense and an ignoring precedent."
We're going to stop doing mass grants of temporary protective status.
How long did it take for people in the crowd to realize what was happening?
"All right, we'll see."
"Okay, let's just keep watching this."
It's a very good thing.
"Again, this is a must win state for Harris."
"Um, what if their life was better do they want to own a ho they want to buy groceries family that serve this co want them to vote?"
"He's a dealmaker, and he never loses sight of the American people."
Two generations definitely worth watching.
Horsestrawn buggies from the Amish and motorcycle and Hell's Angels.
"The other thing I would just say, having watched now the event with Cheney and Longwell and Harris in Pennsylvania, the vice president's very comfortable in this group."
"The bullet design on the front, the inspirational quote in the back, and you get free shipping on orders above $50."
I'm glad everyone's okay.
I think there's a lot of work to be done.
"I mean, we see that on the five thirty eight numbers here, she's ahead by two point eight percent."
We are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants.
"I mean, when you watch this, you're just like this is some of the most vile, weird, just weird filth that's out there here."
"I mean, but she said last week that she can't think of one thing that she would do differently."
And we're going to be seeing it through different campaign efforts and as well as today in Pennsylvania.
They've lost because what Pennsylvanians have done is reject extremism.
"So yeah, they're saying that Trump looks forward to attend the Republican convention that they're having."
"Former President Bill Clinton is supporting Harris in Georgia, while Senator Bob Casey is targeting GOP challenger Dave McCormick's residency in a new advertisement."
He won.
"With his sanctions after Biden and, uh, uh, Obama helped him out."
"That right, it's like, yeah."
We'll take a two minute break.
But this is a direct reaction in my opinion to the debate where Donald Trump makes an absolute fool of himself.
She is the Vice President of the United States for having a sake.
"We obviously knew he was going to be there that day, but I had zero expectation."
We're all Republicans.
"No, these are new voters."
"All right, Brandon, thank you so much for weighing in."
You think Donald Trump's ever changed his diaper?
"I don't know about you, but I am excitedly anxious."
"Last night, we had a phenomenal situation."
What are the odds?
"You had not even 60,000 voters turnout in this district."
We'll take some questions from the reporters before we hit the road.
"Of course, if you told him about the transitive property, he'd be like, I don't know in that one, so I don't know what you're talking about."
Shapiro is popular among his constituents in a battleground state with a 61% approval rating according to a poll released by Fox News last month.
That's what many people said on the Internet.
"And it's interesting who he's going up against, Dave McCormick."
But so I would personally keep that in mind.
"Well, she was very confident in what she was saying She showed leadership ability and understanding of the topics at hand But again, she didn't go in depth I did like what she said about what she's gonna try to do for the middle class about a tax break for us Which would be very nice But still a little bit more information on some of the things that she's playing on doing Sean also with the UAW the grade you gave it again."
The western part of the state is more midwestern or upper midwestern.
"Like so much else in North Hampton County, who wins here likely will come down to one thing, who works the hardest."
And tell me why.
One of the stories that you wrote had to do with an interesting quirk in Pennsylvania's impact on the Electoral College.
"And even the Trump team is convinced that if she picked Josh Shapiro, that would take Pennsylvania off the table."
"And she started going on a rant and he said, man, man, hold on a second."
"You can check out more content from my channel here, and as always, thank you so much for watching."
"And Trump, there's sort of a bit of a positive reassessment of him since he's been president by some folks that might be helping him as well."
"You know, they remain red."
He's not going to die.
He was talking about her Time magazine cover.
But it's all about the margins in Trump countries.
You may register that way to protest vote in the primary election.
"And now that her fate politically relies on battleground states, including Pennsylvania, she no longer supports a fracking ban publicly."
"So things have certainly gotten better for Kamala Harris than they were for Biden, but I think it's still advantage Republican."
"Missed it entirely in Philadelphia, Detroit, and other key cities where black turnout in general was lower than it had been for President Obama and black men specifically."
She's all in now.
"In this region, Latino communities make up 9 percent of the state's overall population."
" senior national correspondent Terry Moran, who is there at that Pennsylvania rally."
"Nancy Cortez, thank you."
"But, you know, I'm hearing from some Democrats, it's still hard to get a turnout and Trump is cutting into some of that black vote in the city."
"That's pretty big, man."
So this is what I'm thinking.
"He ends up he ends up winning the election in total He wins by 1.2 So if he wins by 1.2 and the polls are saying about 4.7 he the polls were off by about 3.5 Now the Wisconsin results You can see here you're only won by 0.7 this looks really close to this 20,000 votes It's pretty crazy if we look at the Wisconsin numbers though, check this out."
They destroyed evidence.
"Those people are more dangerous, the enemy from within, than Russia and China."
"Thank you, Pittsburgh."
Now his remarks were twice interrupted by medical emergencies in the crowd.
There are no state officials around.
This was a poll in Notre Dame.
We will stand proudly for our flag.
"Hello, everybody."
"One reason this race is not just so tight but doesn't move very much is that each camp, Harris voters, Trump voters, not only disagree on what should be, but also have very different views on what is today."
"Concrete plans, that's who Kamala is."
Raise fresh alarms about vote counting delays and chaos in battleground states.
" Hello everyone, today we will analyze the last 14 polls in Pennsylvania between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris."
"It's using all of the voter data that comes in through the Pennsylvania Secretary of State, puts it into a nice website."
"You know, he's not a career politician."
"The sixth poll was conducted between September 12th and 16 by Quinnipiac University among 1,331 likely voters."
Nobody's perfect.
Thank you guys.
The former president continued mocking Harris.
"They remember those early years of the Biden administration and And and that's why they're both candidates are trying to make those working-class appeals and trying to chip away where Trump is trying to win Some of those working-class black and Latino voters who maybe were Democrats in the past Harris trying to win back some of the white working-class voters who have been part of the Trump base because as we just said a Tiny tiny shift in any group could really make the difference Well as we consider working-class voters, obviously They are large populations in the rust belt in the blue wall specifically where it does seem Harris is Targeting more for energy at least this week for all of the conversation We had in the nascent days of her candidacy which arguably were still in Jonathan There was talk of an expanded map include the Sun Belt potentially she could be competitive in are we reverting now?"
"But Trump still pulled it off, you know, by winning those key swing states."
God is on the side of anything other than every single American.
Considering the fact that y'all are not quiet as fuck ever since the shooter has been identified as not black and if he was y'all would be running y'all fucking mouths right now.
"I was with her in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, you know, a week or two ago."
You put it all together.
"I mean, if we all collectively had a dollar for every time we talk to someone that said, you know, I don't like the way he speaks, but you know, I'm not voting for him because I think he's a great person."
"During the town hall with voters, Trump spoke about the economy criticizing Harris's policies."
 Let's turn to the 2024 race.
"Well, according to 538 National Polling, Donald Trump is leading Kamala Harris as the preferred president, 48% to 46%."
"Kathleen Loeschel, well, thank you so much."
"But do you really believe that Kamala Harris has more appeal to blue collar voters that most of them were Democrats just 10 years ago than Joe Biden did, especially in Pennsylvania?"
"As we approach the November elections, Kennedy's actions and comments are sure to keep the political landscape tense."
We know that the counties that were more Republican.
I've never seen a candidate do anything like this.
"It can be misleading, especially in a state like Pennsylvania because well, there's a bunch of ancestral Democrats in the Commonwealth, especially in the western half of the state."
"And in a lot of ways, it felt like the aspirations of working people have taken a backseat to the priorities of the rich and the powerful and the well-connected."
"Everyone, let's thank President Trump."
So these kinds of polls look really good.
What happened in the days and weeks leading up to January 6 after that was truly shocking to me.
This is a little bit of her from a debate on June 29th.
He's polling by up by 1% in the state of Michigan.
"Much of that, though, obviously targeted or is really being heard."
And you're trying to exploit that?
"If you threw a dart at Pennsylvania, we're literally in the center."

"Hello, Arizona."
"Honestly, they should let Steven prosecute the case against Trump, although they'd probably just make him share a mic with Merrick Garland."
We will be there covering the rally tomorrow but for now reporting from Sky Harbor International Airport Nicole Christine Fox 10 News.
"Look, you're the national political reporter for the Washington Post."
I was attracted to the Republican Party because it was less government.

I hope he wins in November.
"When Trump was asked the question, he very succinctly said, drill baby drill."
You sent some fighters to D.C.
"There go if the polling is one point left now, Harris is still up in the national popular vote."
And he's also a young Democrat who has ambitions of his own to run for president.
"It's gonna be a straight dog fight and who's gonna it's a pure toss-up right now The only state I think that's really a harder dog fight is North Carolina So even the smallest of a little thing can change this result in terms of Pennsylvania It's gonna be so damn close But we're gonna look at this here and see how close it's gonna be in terms of what's going on with this Polish American vote So it says Polish Americans are not an ethnic group that typically gets mentioned in modern American presidential debates So when vice president Kamala Harris noted Pennsylvania's large Polish American population as she discussed the threat that Russia posed to Poland Timothy el kuzma said was pleasantly surprised you start talking about Poland and Polish Americans His ears are gonna perk up said mr Kuzma national president of the Polish Falcons of America a Non-for-nonprofit fraternal benefit organization that provides life insurance for its members and is based in Pittsburgh and the battleground state of Pennsylvania Polish Americans who comprise more than 5% of the population are an important if politically overlooked demographic many of Pennsylvania's roughly 700,000 Polish Americans share a common fear that Vladimir v. Putin has ambitions to restore the former Soviet Union's sphere of influence in Eastern Europe Including Poland so 700,000 Polish Americans in the state and what's interesting enough?"
He should never been on trial for the whole gun charge.
So that's the right decision for Vice President Harris to make.
Donald Trump then lies and says the January 6th committee's destroying all their evidence or has destroyed all of their evidence.
So this is part of that effort to court suburban women.
But when she did you know she cribbed Trump's idea for no tax on tips.
And all of it has to be tied back to Biden.
"Look, we're in March."
This is so dramatic and so different than anything that has happened before Dan that this really shows something different this time that the vice president really is getting a lot more attention than I've ever seen.
"But by the way, first, I want to talk to you about why Harris is there."
"So again, easiest way to do it for Harris is to go to Michigan and Wisconsin and win them both."
"Well, on that question in particular, and you're right, I think Americans want pragmatic solutions to real problems."
"Speaker Bowers, I understand that a week after that call, Mr. Giuliani appeared with others associated with President Biden, and he was in Trump's effort to overturn the result of the election at a purported legislative hearing in a hotel ballroom in Phoenix."
Are you registered to vote in Pennsylvania?
I put it away because I was afraid that Elon Musk was controlled opposition.
"I mean, look, it's it's just a bottomless and endless supply of money here going against Bob Casey."
"But if you look at battleground states, where electoral votes are decided, it looks like Harris has a lead in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and even in Michigan."
"To me it's eminently appropriate that Pennsylvania, which was the birthplace of American democracy, that in some ways is going to be answering these questions about where we want our democracy to go moving forward."
I don't think it's fair that there's so much expectation put on her and very little put on Donald Trump when it comes to debate.
Sometimes families are getting divided.
"The winner gets called by like 11 o'clock, 1130 at night."
"But Ben, it took eight and a half in Texas, eight and a half hours, eight and a half hours for Donald Trump to write a mean note saying that Texas should audits this election."
"You know what, Megan, I can't speak for Dan here."
It was around eight.
And we were in constant communication with the National Archives to make sure that those weren't accepted.
"And after he was rushed off the stage with blood in his face, a spokesperson said Trump is fine and this is a heinous act."
She was Obama's field director in Pennsylvania back in 2008.
"No, he's like having Jeeves change his tire."
And boy did I get really nervous.
Is that a smart choice?
"If you can look in the picture there, you'll see a little fence on the side, I think to the left and the ballots are behind there."
"You have to make sure you get out in these counties, because we know this election is going to be close."
"And folks in particularly communities like mine in the Mon Valley region of Allegheny County, those big steel country have seen jobs leave and they know how that devastates a community."
You can't take your eye off a big county like Bucks County or or even Delaware County in the southeast or Allegheny County in the west where you have the potential for big swings.
He was black.
I said there was going to be a correction within poly market.
"Thanks, guys."
"You have three hours to meet our... Oh, is that a camera?"
"I mean you look at Nevada, you look at Georgia, North Carolina, all important states but from the perspective of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, you know for Harris or Trump there's no pathway to the presidency without one or multiple of these states."
"And again, he's he's these 13 soldiers were killed because of Biden and Harris's competence."
The last few weeks of prediction market sentiment and polling data show that the US presidential race was less of a test of Donald Trump's popularity and more of an expression of incumbent Joe Biden's unpopularity.
Kamala has just been there.
And that just slows things down even more right if they have to stop and start back up again.
According to that clip from Nancy Pelosi herself on the New Yorker.
So he has a long history with the Commonwealth.
" all right so Kamala Harris had a sit-down interview with a local station and they asked her about her economic plan and she basically repeated the same thing that she always says the interviewer wanted to get some details on her economic plan so she says that well I'm from the middle class and blah blah blah blah opportunity economy blah blah blah blah I was gonna actually react to it right here but I'm just so sick of her saying the exact same thing it's ridiculous it's pretty pathetic at this point she's gonna give $25,000 new homeowner home buyers which makes those first of all where's this tax credit gonna come from where are they gonna find the money for all this and even if they do okay let's say you give away $25,000 to somebody who's looking to buy a home or whatever okay well then if you're selling a home if you're selling a home naturally you're gonna raise the price of the home by $25,000 because you now know that this person has access to $25,000 from the government anyway she says she wants to build 3,000 new homes or apartments or whatever okay yeah how are you actually gonna do that you know it's just really embarrassing at this point she can only perform on a really controlled environments which made the debate really frustrating obviously the moderators supported her as much as they could attack Trump as much as they could Trump's still fail to just expose her but I'm not gonna dwell on that we still have a little more time to go in this campaign and it's pretty obvious that she has nothing new to offer as far as a plan she just repeats what she's been coached to say and that's all we're really dealing with here so she gets into the White House who's actually gonna be running the show seriously but she have any ability to actually do this job she talked about her economic plan she has no experience whatsoever running large organizations companies corporations or anything governments even she was an attorney attorney general of California prosecutor in San Francisco she became a US senator but I mean where's a real practical experience actually running large organizations the answer is she doesn't have any and she doesn't really need any because she's not gonna be running this show so there you go thanks for watching thanks for listening and don't forget the future belongs those who bear for today and speaking of the election there has been some good news as far as the election is not all gloom and doom as far as World War three and all this other stuff there are has been a ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and it's really good news for Trump essentially they're saying that mail-in ballots without correct dates will not be counted so you can't be submitting mail-in ballots without the right dates so some good news right there they have to have some type of standards put in place and let me say this one more time about elections you cannot have a situation where it takes three days to count the damn votes the system loses all credibility system loses all credibility when that happens and going back to the world situation with Ukraine the problem with the Ukraine using long range missiles given to them by the US and UK is that they need satellite satellite technology they don't have the technology and expertise actually utilize these long range missiles without direct involvement from NATO that means the United States means to UK and if they're in a situation where they're they get to okay from the United States and UK NATO to actually use these long range missiles in Russia Russia's there Putin is saying that it means that Russia is gonna be a war with NATO now what does that really mean does that mean they're gonna the Russian Navy is gonna take on the US Navy the US has the best Navy I say that much it doesn't mean nuclear weapons is I mean tactical weapon tactical tactical nukes been used throughout Europe what does that really mean that's the question I do know this Putin has set red lines before and they don't has crossed them over and over again so at this point does anybody in London and Washington really take Russia seriously do they take Putin seriously now right now the Washington is sort of pulling back with this idea we've seen this in the past where somebody in Europe or suggest a let's do cross this red line and Washington says well I don't know about that but then later on it come around say well okay go ahead and do it we've seen this pattern play out over and over and now Putin is saying that a if you cross this red line we know we will consider NATO to be directly involved in this conflict what is it what what what exactly will be the consequences what is Russia gonna do I mean that's the big question there's talk that maybe Russia can do a demonstration of a nuclear test they haven't done that since 1990 I don't think that's gonna be effective in deterring NATO because at this point a lot of people in NATO believe that a Russia is gonna do anything all right this is to say the world we have a presidential election where it's pretty obvious that we're in big trouble we're in very big trouble that's if we don't end up in World War three before then so do your best to take care of yourself take care of your family I wanted to range today enjoy that and I'll forget the future belongs to those who prepare for today"

"Now, whether... Now, again, whether you think that was just incompetence or something else, it's not OK. We want every legal ballot to be cast and to be counted in the United States of America."
I understand that taking the courageous positions that you did following the 2020 election in defense of the rule of law and protecting the voters of Arizona resulted in you and your family being subjected to protests and terrible threats.

You remember the term?
Governor Walz has to go around and somehow convince the American people that Kamala Harris is going to solve the very problem she's been creating over the last three and a half years.
Just say no more.
"If it were up to liberals, their argument was that Donald Trump didn't lose more jobs because they wanted everything shut down for months on end."
Both campaigns are fully aware of the stakes.
It's why everyone ought to be watching CBS and watching the debate and see what see what transpires.
It might be something different.
But post on social media.
Whoever is selected in the number two spot for the Democrats could indeed make an impact on the race for the White House.

"Otherwise, they'll do it again."
Squashing claims made by rival Kamala Harris that Donald Trump's rallies don't have big numbers.
She she doesn't have a lot more opportunities to rise in the polls.
And then we have the dissenter.
It was basically all that anybody and the old people could do was allow the timber to grow.
"I said, why do you do that?"
But you can make the case for the others.
That's the phrase I want you to remember.
"And Terry, let's talk about the goal of this rally."
We were supposed to be getting out of people's lives and respecting how they choose to live and respecting that in harmony.
But I came expecting very strong opinions about that verdict.
"The Trump campaign has questioned the accuracy of these polls, noting discrepancies in self-reported voting behavior from 2020."
Their oversampling did show that Donald Trump's in a position to win a considerable share of the black vote compared to previous Republican candidates but also that's at the trade-off of losing and losing ground with white voters.

The whole thing will be won.
Time Magazine doesn't have a picture of her.
One of the most consequential implications of this intricate electoral landscape is the critical role of voter turnout.
I think we all have to on a daily basis.
So what about Nevada?
We're seeing small dollar donations.
But I don't think it's going to work very well.

"One open Arizona lawsuit filed by the Arizona GOP chairwoman demands that the state purge at least 500,000 voters from its rolls, claiming they've either died or moved from the state."
So do you think that there's room for the debate tonight to change people's minds based on all of the background and knowledge that you have?
"Yes, Democrats are dominating early voting in Pennsylvania, but Republicans often make up ground on election day itself."
That ends today.

"In a two-to-one decision, the Commonwealth Court upheld a county judge's month-old order."
We all know that and this road they're continuing down is dangerous for our democracy.

And I think that was up to that point.
Does that feel like a conspiracy theory a little bit?
So yes for the greater good I am all for what just happened on that stage because we have to think of this shit.
"So, you know, Michigan and the primary Nikki Haley missed by 11 points."
Election officials who refuse to cheat by filling extra votes and finding extra votes for him.

"This is the first time where I'm thinking, yeah, I think they're probably doing that here as well, because we're going to get to the Wisconsin poll in a future video, but that's a one point race and it is just borderline impossible for Wisconsin to be a one point race and Pennsylvania to be a five point race."
And I say was because earlier this summer he decided to write an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer endorsing Kamala Harris as a local GOP leader.
"Okay, we're living in an insane asylum right now, okay?"
This is a tragedy.
"The early voting trends in favor of the Democrats are promising for Kamala Harris, but nothing is set in stone."
So this is the place where Democrats have a big anchor with their votes.
It's gotta be somebody in there.
And Stahl correctly points out it wasn't a guarantee.
I can't believe I'm doing it.
"Finally, down south, we have two more likely red states."
That's our responsibility.
"Yeah, it was on a Sunday, right and she was the she wasn't even officially running and you know How many days let's find that?"

Why aren't we looking at it?
"Yeah, just a couple of days away from the RNC kicking off, you understand why the keystone state is so critical to both of these campaigns and why so much interest is being paid here is this is the state that both of these campaigns are really looking at the one that could potentially shift the balance of power when it comes to getting to 270 electoral votes."

He drove to the private watch party that we had.
"Next, Donald Trump talks about the federal criminal cases where he's a criminal defendant."
The reason why I say it's cooked is because the sycophantic fan base that is known for playing the victim when it comes to everything just watch their guy almost get kablooied and then come back up with a black power fist which is now going to further feed their victim complex.
Others told us they would like the governor to finish out his term leading the Commonwealth.

Not South America.

"I feel like having a woman in office will make the, like... will make reproduction rights more available for women."
So there's a big morale problem.
It goes down as safe blue here.
They did one here we have keeping into account the other candidates.
You have Hubert Humphrey of Walter Mondale.
So you look at all the big musicians.
And Elizabeth Taylor is very white.
You've got a new kid.
"On the pathway to 270, Harris is 226."
We have video here.
Hey we've got all this money but we can't actually organize it.
"This can be particularly effective in debates, where Trump can highlight the ruling as a success for his campaign and as evidence of his commitment to secure elections."
You could do all of that in advance and still not push the button that tabulates the results.
Then they actually got to implement it.
Now.
And it worked.
"He has a connection there and he was gonna be beaten there badly because after the debate his campaign was just collapsing but You know, obviously Harris is better than 2024 Biden is she as good as 2020 Biden?"
This election is the most crucial election of our lifetime.
"Now, as a couple of days ago, it was not even 67% Democrat as just above 24% Republican."
And you know who else loves it?
"Today with the stock market hitting a new record high, the Harris campaign highlighted a survey of economists in the Wall Street Journal who agreed that Donald Trump's policies would drive up prices, interest rates, and the national debt while hurting manufacturing jobs."
"But I want to get into Trump's endorsement passage of him, which honestly made the endorsement worse, in my opinion."
"Trump, it's going to be a red wave."
Every aspect of Amish living is under attack.
"One, do those numbers match your internal numbers, Senator?"
"So we kind of came in thinking we were going to get a good mix of voters, and I think we did that."

"Well, we've seen it in the reproductive right amendments and state ballot initiatives in seven states thus far where they don't poll."
I'm going for Trump.
"It's tough, tough work, bringing energy out of the ground, bringing that gas out of the ground for us to have electricity, for us to not be dependent on other countries."
It probably never will be.
I'm looking at two strong football teams in Pennsylvania this year.
You're human.

You can vote by mail in advance.
"You need to think about those 39 minutes when he pranced around the stage playing disc jockey and dancing at his own rally just a couple of days ago, the word salads that have gotten worse and more incoherent."
It felt as though personal excellence was under attack.
I give Kamala gets 20% of the Republicans in Pennsylvania.
That's why Trump's got to keep bringing it up.
That's a good deal.
And this is a state that's razor thin.
"And looking at the state's polling, Harris leads by just 4.7%, even running under the literal governor."
And a tremendous amount of undecided and independent voters swinging in Kamala Harris's direction.
Tariffs aren't unique to President Trump.
"One thing they've been saying, a lot of your press hits get criticized."
I started that in... Can you show me?
"Harris 48, Trump 47."
"So it's intriguing, but Pennsylvania is ground zero."
And it's interesting that President Biden now has been trying to tie the Republican Party writ large to what he terms the MAGA movement.
"But Shapiro, I think whoever she chooses to be a good, uh, good person to go alongside her."
We definitely do skew more towards Democrat than Republican.
"If someone says, look, I like Governor Josh Shapiro."
That's the kind of person who's going to help Kamala get stuff done.
What what?
Absolutely she can take the state.
Harris is leading by just three percentage points nationally and by just one percent in battleground states.

"He then calls the leader of the Senate, Democrat Chuck Schumer, a Palestinian and someone who's with Hamas."
"Oh, Benny, you're just using one video to make a point, or this is just a video that went viral."
Let me ask you one more and turn over to James.
"In his signature style, he took a dig at his political rivals and said that he will save democracy once he's voted back to power."
I said it's going to be a closed state regardless of what happens.
What are your top issues?
We're going to be talking about all of this.
"And now that he is facing pressure from the American people, he's doing what he's always done when he faced that pressure, which is he dodges, he ducks and he lies."
Yeah it was really interesting because Governor Walz gave a more concrete answer to this question about how Harris would be different from a Biden administration than Harris herself ever has he specifically said that she is going to be more focused on the care economy and child care stuff that has not been as much of the focus for the Biden administration take a listen to what else he said here.
We're going to ask why he was his.
I think the vast majority of them will return to Biden in the general.
So the closest Quinnipiac poll I could find around this date and time was October 1st to October 5th that Quinnipiac did.
Any indication on when we'll know who it could be?
Play this clip.
It is these metrics that show consistency and a lead for Kamala Harris and something that should terrify Republicans.
How is he going to fix that?
"So the fact that Liz Cheney got, I don't have the number on top of my head was 20 plus percent in that group in Wyoming."
"And Trump immediately acknowledged that when he came on the stage Wednesday evening and how he took a jab right at Kamala Harris, you know, as to be expected."
"So the economy has been a tough sell for President Biden throughout this campaign, as you well know, is his campaign advisers point to metrics and say, look, things are actually going pretty well."
"So for Trump to be in a good position to win Pennsylvania, it bodes very well from the win the presidency."
"And so I think Kamala Harris really narrowing down this state too, also has now been translated to some of the political betting market odds."
I had to sit on the side of the table.
"And both Feig and Aquafina have great things to say about our own Dali de Leon, who steals some scenes in the movie."
Quinnipiac actually describes that as a head to head outcome because that three point margin that Donald Trump has is within their margin for error.
That's why it's good news across the board when it comes to voter registration.
"A lot of them not going to vote or they're going to vote third party, or maybe some of them might even cross over vote for Trump."
We heard a lot about threats to lawmakers.
He's close to 50 and it was an accurate poll.
"On the one hand, he said that Trump's populist appeal from 2016 has significantly decreased, while on the other hand, he credited Harris's success to her ability to resonate with a diverse variety of individuals, including moderate Republicans and independents."
And he would talk to Anna's point about economic populism.
All you see is Trump.
"But these two places, they have gone on opposite corners."
"Today is Saturday, August 10th, 2024, and this morning, the New York Times and Sienna College released an A plus poll across three battleground states, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, showing Kamala Harris with a four-point lead in every single battleground state."
"The New York Times, it's pretty bad."
What do we know about Wisconsin and the tightness of the race in that battleground?
They were banking on having a three month long surge till the election.
Talked about me on the campaign trail.
"The first one is obviously, you know, the rising power of the Latino vote here in the state coming out of this whole history of, you know, controversial immigration laws like SB 1070, the infamous, you know, Sheriff Joe Arpaio right here in Maricopa County, all the way to this whole new roster of Democratic leaders on a state and federal level that have really played a significant effort in boosting Latino turnout here in the state."
"Um I can't say being because I'm pretty much t know exactly where you st better way or a smoother you know where you stand one of these, he's gonna and do something else ove have anything else to add is might be on the fence vote for?"
"They only need one seat if Donald Trump wins the White House, two seats if Kamala Harris wins."
But not President Trump.
We saw it on January 6th.
"They found that the Senate Democrats lead here by a tremendous, tremendous amount in the state of Pennsylvania."
"Now, there's all these criticisms that people will throw at Dr. Oz and you know, some of them I don't necessarily agree with."
"Whether it was in that call or in a later meeting, he did bring that up more than once."
And it's not exactly all that friendly to the Democrats.
Let's go America.
"254, top right at the screen, 226 for the Dems."
It's things like the border.
"And as you said, so much has changed."
And the reason is because he's not afraid to go out there.
And no tax on Social Security benefits for our seniors.
"They wanna change, and that's what they see in Donald Trump."
No clear politics puts her at forty eight point three percent compared to Trump with forty seven point six.
Metages change their algorithm to suppress political content.
Both the Trump and Harris campaigns are looking to court voters in the state's so-called Latino belt.
So on the national picture when it comes to polls we're not seeing as much volume that we saw at this point in say 2016.
She says that she was raised on a pig farm without insulation or running water and like an outhouse.
The same people will be behind the scenes running the country because Kamala is incompetent.
Possibly.
Let me make sure that I'm sharing my screen correctly.
But she got more baggage than Chicago during a snowstorm at O'Hare.
"I've never been a red, maggot wearing guy."
We saw in the debate.
I do not know what that means.
"You know, when you move from one address to another, you can tell the Postal Service, hey, I moved, send my mail that is going to this old address to this new address."
It is indeed a close race.
"Section 4 â€“ Harris in the Crosshairs Trump didn't hold back during his speech, launching scathing attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris."
Thank you both for joining me tonight.
It was something ridiculous.
"First of all, we are going to fight to lower grocery and housing prices for all of us."
"It stuck with me because it was just such a weird moment where they were essentially, you know, having a press conference, but you weren't allowed to ask questions, they want to identify themselves."
"However, the Trump campaign was the exactly that's okay."
"RFK juniors endorsed Trump, so he's not going to take much from Trump."
We also have to make sure that the system works the way it was supposed to.
There's an actual FBI wanted poster for the swords and daggers.
Trump's message of economic strength and job creation resonates strongly with voters concerned about inflation.
I wonder what the hell happens during that 45.
My homeroom teacher is Mr. Gala.
I think she's a weak leader so with Trump being President already and He can be a good leader for us and not only for the US but throughout the whole world.
We have to compete in every community.
"And if they do, then we have them sign up for a mail-in ballot."
 Good morning and welcome back to Rising Fridays.
Delaware is right next door to Pennsylvania.
"No, gun, you know, big gun control in the in in the form that Warnock was talking about Harris' position is not popular at all among labor or a lot of Pennsylvania."
"Tim Ryan, Leland, is clearly running in a way that is aiming to distance himself from the National Democratic Party, emphasizing his own blue collar roots."
She parked her car there.
Candidates are not allowed pre written notes on stage and microphones will be muted when it's not their turn to speak.
You have this amazing new podcast with Crooked Media.
That's the laugh of a crazy person.
And that's part of the crackdown halfway through my shift.
"Well, listen, I think that the headline that I read about the rally in Pennsylvania yesterday was the big question and it's the one that Kamala Harris has not been able or willing to answer."
"Now, here's the problem."
"If this holds with the advantage of around 8%, obviously the others, you know, they're probably going to lean more liberal, at least on average, at least they did in 2020, because that's how you get, if you have a four point Republican electorate advantage and then the Republican loses by half a point, that's a lot of independence going left."
So there's a lot of us who are not so woke but still very willing to have discourse and very willing to kind of come to compromises.
Please follow our Instagram at Midas Touch right now as we head towards four hundred thousand followers.
All eyes are on Kamala Harris as we wait for the first major decision of her presidential campaign.
Was the older number.
"And they'll also have Secret Service personnel stationed not only inside the security perimeter, but outside as well, including on that roof where it is sure fired those shots."
"As you said, the E.P."
"Advocates say that it could prevent the US citizenship pronunciation, which occurs partly due to this complex tax regulation."
People are scared.
"There are 80,000 truckers in Pennsylvania alone."
"And that's why some people were like, they were shocked that Trump, and it doesn't make a lot of sense that Trump would be plus three in the popular vote, but losing some of the swing States, which is what Atlas Intel had it."
"That's like, you know this person they don't know how to speak or this person is, you know He's quiet."
Did not happen.
I still believe that the election was stolen and that there were too many inconsistencies to know whether or not it was legitimate or not.
"But as you're noting, we're seeing something of a different pattern potentially this year."
So Fox News used birtherism.
Harris is riding a big wave of momentum to the Democratic DNC there.
"Yeah, I mean, because we were there on Thursday, word spread like wildfire that Biden might drop out, right?"
"He's pissing off a lot of his fellow liberals, but he's not with 538, didn't really make that forecast."
They were required to issue leases under the Inflation Reduction Act.
"We believe that true freedom gives each of us the right to make decisions about our own lives, how we worship, who we marry, what our family looks like."
"So Northampton for Trump, Erie for Harris."
That's your grandson?
It's way down.
That's exactly what I've been expecting.
Can you tell us a little bit more about that anticipation that it hasn't just been going on today?
There's never been anything like it.
"It could be a fluke, could be, you know, oh, actually the polls overstate Trump this time."
"So if her best polls are Harris plus one from Signal, which I know is Republican pollster, but they tend to be accurate more often than not."
"And they basically wait the liberal polls that have been wrong significantly in 2020 and 2016, they, they weight them heavily."
I see him almost every time I come into the state.
"So on issue after issue after issue on all of the metrics, Democrats are actually showing that they're there to work for working class Americans while Republicans just do this shtick once every four years to get into office."
"It was very high, very steep."
"In 2020, you had a couple, but outside of that, it was mostly Biden plus six, Biden plus seven, Biden plus ten, not Biden plus two, not Biden plus one."
"But Lake's vote here is much more spread out, including a lot who say they're because there she's the party nominee and fewer who say because they like the candidate in particular, which again helps explain why Lake is running so much behind Donald Trump right now."
You are doing the Lord's work.
We've had a historic pandemic that wreaked havoc on communities and businesses.
"And tonight, another record high in the stock market, the Dow closing above 43,000 for the first time ever today."
Their support for Harris could help her make inroads in a state where every vote matters.
Is Pennsylvania really as close as the polls suggest or does one candidate have an edge that isn't reflected here?
Look at absentee requests.
Cool.
The Simpsons already have predicted he was going out in 2024.
Nobody is here to debate that by any means.
"President Trump is still ahead in Arizona, but that lead is narrow."
"And a lot of people have been supporting Carla Sands, but there's, you know, stuff in her past that it's a little bit iffy to say the very least regarding that."
Now you see a lot of those people kind of shifting towards Trump and Kamala Harris is not doing anything to win them over.
But this is not what the polls the polls are saying right now.
"I'm saying, my God, the number of weird things that have happened in this election, I don't think that we've actually had that number of strange things happen in any other election, maybe in US history."
"But of course, Latinos con Harris, the whole thing is just a disaster."
"I'm not saying that Trump's going to win Pennsylvania by four points or whatever, but you cannot tell me that this is a fluke that nearly every poll."
The explanation I want is how this election could possibly be so close.
"I'm curious, so both were recently in Pennsylvania."
"Abortion is number four, but abortion is significantly behind the three major."
"You can still show up on election day, a cast a provisional ballot if you're uncomfortable."
"We need to come out in record numbers, but Nikki Lew is not getting them."
The only place I go is McDonald's.
It's more of the same.
"Because the advantage, well, it may have been a long time, six months of constantly leading in the polls."
"Although Harris is technically ahead, this poll reveals an extremely tight race where Trump's space remains strong and could tip the scales in his favor."
He can get it done.
What got me paying attention to politics was in 2016.
He's getting a lot of criticism for being too friendly with China.
You need to be screened to enter this area.
And it is not compassionate to allow hundreds of thousands of American citizens to die of fentanyl overdoses.
So all these numbers were correct.
That's a shocking number.
Donald Trump has managed to bounce back in the last two weeks.
"So theoretically, it should have caught the surge for Democrats when it comes to voter registration, if there was any."
"If you want to look at Northampton County and look at the relative demography of it, it's 54% working class white, which is the case of a lot of these, you know, Midwestern areas that will dictate the election."
You may remember debated Harris back during 2019 Democratic primary season.
"If this trend continues, then the gender gap is going to be moving in an even more bigger and more extreme direction."
"Oh, I knew that would get you."
She had none.
And that in many ways looks like her challenge and her task in the remaining weeks of the campaign.
I had friends who disagreed with me on every issue.
The gender gap is something we talk about a lot.
Trump is set to hold a major rally with GOP candidates tomorrow night.
They're threatened constantly.
They don't necessarily come from places where they have been allowed to or encouraged to participate in civic life.
When he knows that we could advance the ball based upon the expertise of the border patrol.
I am voting for Donald Trump.
And the good news is that you have a candidate.
"Vance, the bad one, bad one, bad one, bad one, when you take a look at the favorability ratings, just a 33 percent, forty four, forty three percent of the country has a disapproval 10 point delta between the two."
I got to put in a pitch for my friend Tom Hagan.
"Vaughn, let's talk more about that high profile battle for the Republican nomination for governor right now."
"And I know people, a lot of Republicans they're not too fond of Kerry Lake, but if, I mean, listen, there's possible Trump takes us by four and a half."
"My fellow nerds, we were the best decision desk in the business for 10 years."
"And he's really been our friend, right?"
"Yep, that's absolutely right."
What I love most of all about Wilkes-Barre voters is that they are the kindest people.
So I love what I do is a passion.
We're leading in some nationally.
"Last week, the 44th President of America gave a blistering performance in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."
"Energy workers say nobody believes what she said, and rightfully so."
"And that's actually good news for Donald Trump's campaign, because it means this election is by no means over."
"Specifically, she's having a tough time garnering support from Muslim and Arab leaders due to concerns over U.S. policies in the Middle East."
"Political writer at the Los Angeles Times, Sima Mehta, told us both candidates are sharpening their attacks in those key states."
She's not going to win Pennsylvania by four or five points.
"Maybe it's a fluke, but when you look at the early voting, you look at even the polls now."
Republicans did well.
"And so what the Biden administration last week said was, well, with respect to January 6th, we're going to let these White House officials be subpoenaed, testify in front of Congress and the like."
Will Joe Biden manage to find his way to the podium or will he be wandering around at the wrong podium or looking for the door out the back or whatever?
" Hello everyone, today we will analyze the last 12 polls in Pennsylvania between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris."
"To the point of the third parties that you mentioned, a recent Reuters poll showed that 40 percent of Arab and Muslim voters in Michigan are now backing the Green Party candidate Jill Stein."
What is that saying?
We are looking at a relationship with evil that cannot be tolerated.
"It's a must have for Kamala Harris, but if you look at other states that are swing states like Arizona, like Georgia, like Nevada, you know Trump is actually doing better and overperforming in all those states than he did in 2020 and in 2016."
"A new Alien film for sci-fi fans, a family adventure and an action comedy."
You just do so many things.
"They've been voting Republican for 30 years, but they're now Republicans."
They say America is racist and America is trash and America is this.
"So you're telling me that the enthusiasm search for Harris in Pennsylvania, not just some random state."
You saw what happened in Atlanta with Fani?
"While Biden was able to make inroads with some of these voters in 2020, Trump's appeal remains strong in these areas, and he will need to maintain or even expand his rural support to win Pennsylvania in 2024."
I'm a little skeptical.
"Instead, he emphasized the importance of a unity party, allowing for continued disagreements on various issues."
"Just yesterday, I got a call from a cousin who informed me that his sister-in-law was just obliterated to pieces."
"She sort of stepped up, you know, she's always sort of for months, she has been arguing that former President Trump is unfit."
"Yeah, absolutely So I'm like I don't I don't know."
"I can show you one if you really want to see it, but I will use me."
So showing Harris up by 6 percentage points in Georgia while showing Trump up by 6 percentage points in Arizona.
But it's like you have all these other people.
Love you all.
"That you'd hear candidates saying, we're gonna de-register every voter and everyone has to re-register."
What would you say to that?
And these are the places where Nikki Haley did relatively better.
"Kate Bedingfield, former White House communications director and a CNN political commentator and Brad Todd, Republican strategist and a partner in On Message."
"Trump, maybe Trump 2024."
"See, this is like a secret weapon era."
There has to be some true dire situations.
"Only 76,000 votes."
And what does he tell you as well?
"But if this audit, which is doing two Republican counties and two Democratic counties, comes up as empty as the Arizona audit, which I think it will, then that again is a ringing confirmation that the only thing fraudulent going on here is the claims of rigged elections and fried."
Sabatini is also never Trump.
Hell no.
Maybe it's because the underlying inflation is causing all of it.
"If you guys did enjoy this video, smash the like button down below."
He's up by two and that's very telling because that poll was actually accurate in the midterms.
I want you to watch this exchange.
"Well, it's interesting because Trump for a long time, I mean, I've been covering Hill races for over a decade now and we always talk about how he drags down Republicans."
That was because they did an interior poll and they found that the majority of the people within the union endorsed Trump.
And people know what at stake.
And the batteries aren't good.
"We have nobody in Washington that sits back and said, you're not going to raise that fucking price."
Did I have a bill?
Support education training and mentorship programs that lead to good paying jobs for black men like black jobs.
"And if he's winning Pennsylvania, so I love your thoughts."
So let's see what this one is.
"In her speech in Atlanta last night, Kamala Harris even tried to outbrand a new Southern accent."
Kamala Harris is trying to penetrate that.
She's tough.
And do you blame Joe Biden for that?
"Joe Biden flipped the state in 2020, and right now the Cook Political Report has the race for Arizona listed as a toss-up, and recent polling shows the two candidates neck and neck."
You don't need to cross your fingers.
"I mean, this is the challenge, right?"
And then I think government set in with whatever it is that they do.
"We have to understand that, uh, Arizona 20, uh, oh, this is all, this is also really good data."
"Come back, come back."
"So if you are talking to friends and family and neighbors, and it's hard to have political conversations right now, sometimes families are getting divided."
"Zach, what can you tell us about the man who was arrested near a Trump rally near Coachella over the weekend?"
"How significant is this win for Masters and really, I guess, for the weight of Trump's endorsement in this state?"
That's her right.
"The results from this poll suggest that Harris's campaign may be resonating well with voters, particularly among those prioritizing issues such as health care, labor rights, and economic equity."
So it'll be really interesting to look at some of the exit polling on the gender gap here at Geneva.
"Tensions are high everywhere, and some people are reading all sorts of things coming at them from every different angle, she said."
"And, you know, it's a competitive race right now."
"And guys, look, even if you're a MAGA, if you didn't think that he was a lunatic before, you really think that Donald Trump at 78 300 some odd pounds is better looking than Kamala Harris."
"Nydia, let's start with you, Harris back in Pennsylvania today."
There are things we can talk about and talk about civilly.
"It also enhances his legal and political strategy, shapes the narrative on election fraud, consolidates Republican support, and sets the stage for effective debate performance."
So it's very complicated and I'm not sure what sense it makes.
You wouldn't even have to shoot him.
The same trash pollsters that that does this every single year.
Pennsylvania is one of the big ones.
It's all on this now.
I know you've interviewed her as well.
"But my point is that, you know, Fetterman, I thought he was gonna lose."
People make excuses for it.
What came show?
"I don't have details on the shooter yet, although I have heard that the shooter is down, that they have the person."
There is no victory we cannot have.
She was all in then.
They didn't get their mail ballot because they had moved somewhere else.
"So it's, I mean, it's, we're, you know, three weeks out."
Wages have not gone up as high as some people would like.
It hasn't gone blue since Obama in 2008.
"Immigration, I think, is number one on everybody's mind right now."
"We have a very high Probability I should say of more post-election chaos Whether it's organized or spontaneous if we look to see what happened in 2020, you know What what does it say on the National Archives building?"
"The white working-class population, particularly in rural areas and smaller towns, has historically leaned Republican."
Putting an end to fracking once and for all.
I'm doing it.
He's a nearly 80 year old man.
I'm not going to go super long on this.
Chase.
"A lot of people don't realize this, but outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, it is Trump country."
Biden had a seven-point lead in the state in October and you're talking about a one-point game.
"Specifically, those two individuals, if you know what their story was and what we could verify from what they they claimed."
Because those groups tend to vote more.
It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it.
"Because probably she has their best interest that she, when she becomes the president, will push through it."
"And I, as a progressive, am criticizing his approach in this interview because pretty much every question was out of the Republican handbook in which he had to defend, in some cases completely bonkers claims, where he could be a thoughtful journalist, which I think he is at times."
"Issues like trade, manufacturing, and energy have resonated strongly with these voters, many of whom feel left behind by globalization and the decline of traditional industries."
Talk a little bit about some of the voter suppression laws that have been passed by Republicans in that state that they're hoping will play into being able to send that state back into the Republican column in 2024.
"Now, this was in the middle of a pandemic."
"And in Pennsylvania, it was called a red mirage, because it looked like Trump had all these more votes because they didn't count the absentee votes until that day."
"Here, Donald Trump brags about, again, another unhinged lie."
No but in all seriousness you do know this better than I do.
They're specifically targeting Rust Belt states.
Well kind of.
"If not, you hope that doesn't happen."
"But if she adds in, say, Arizona along with Georgia, that's a possibility."
"To do the chaos, allow the criminal cartels to control the border, to allow drugs and fentanyl across our country, or put an end to it once and for all."
"Really all the Nevada 61% chance, Pennsylvania 63% chance."
"Kamala Harris now leading by four points in these three states shows a shift not only from what we saw with Biden, but potentially from the 2020 presidential election where Donald Trump lost these states, but not by four points in any of them."
"And if they don't, you tell them he's got concepts of a plan."
Would you like two in the back?
"So like I said, Dr. Oz and McCormick both are awful."
We're going to bring you together around the Steelers game.
We talked to you as it went on.
I'm Jones Cink and welcome to the Streaming News Network.
So that's what happened there.
"And there may not be a lot of steelworker jobs left in Pennsylvania, but there are enough for President Biden to care about it because, of course, Pennsylvania is a swing state."
So they can at least take on some culpability.
You should just be more optimistic.
You can't keep giving this this tyrant access to all the weapons and bombs that we manufacture.
Right there.
They were going to claim victory.
"There was one that would require you to include some kind of paperwork when you return your early ballot, which of course is a way of disqualifying early ballot voters who don't include that."
"It is my humble pleasure to introduce our amazing vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris."
"So Nevada, I mean, these are really, really good early vote numbers, but this is a very, very early, early snapshot."
She ended up getting 26 compared to her pulled 15.
"Yeah, this is Pennsylvania, not a deep red or deep blue state."
"Should the Vice President lose in Michigan, it's likely that she'd also lose almost every other state on this map, and thereby fall well short of 270 electoral votes."
It's on the ballot there and then of course we're going to continue on the rest of our trip.
"You know, if he were to hypothetically lose Pennsylvania, wins these two states and then gets Wisconsin, he's in a position to win."
We don't do it.
"And yet when Donald Trump lies or cheats or bullies or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls service members like John McCain losers because they died in battle or were captured, when he calls fellow citizens vermin or the enemy within, people make excuses for it."
The process is simple and 100% online.
"So, okay, so see his one story that said that it was a teleprompter."
Pennsylvania is basically the entire ballgame.
Vance encourages voter fraud in Arizona.
Talk a little bit about what's going on there.
"It's just going to be like, here's a little bit of allowance for you."
They be getting juicy though.
"The reason why honestly, a lot of Bernie voters ended up switching parties and voting for Trump is because of that economic messaging."
David.
I think it's a 0.4 percentage point average for Harris and Trump.
So Georgia and Pennsylvania really are gonna be the two states everyone's focusing in and we've seen a lot of poll movement there in the last couple of weeks.
"I mean, I don't want to get personal."
"So I would imagine she's talking about the odds of winning, of knowing who wins Pennsylvania at almost zero."
"They're struggling industrial towns where Trump needs to maximize his vote, smaller cities that are actually booming with Latino immigrants where Harris wants to make gains."
The simple answer is just wanting to move on.
"Tensions with China, Pennsylvania is a state with a large manufacturing industry, and trade wars with China have directly impacted the state's economy."
He's going to spend a lot of money here and his chances of winning are very slight.
The majority are at least a plurality of their supporters.
"And we expect that, but it's not, you're not going to make up eight points like that in a state like Arizona, especially with a more favorable environment for Trump in 2024."
"Yes, So we're here live in But PA at the Trump rally, his an appearance here in But it very easy for you."
Democrats need a firewall of about 390 votes to feel okay that they have a good enough shot of winning the state of Pennsylvania.
I did.
Still decisive.
We are getting to the last leg of the presidential election and the race is seeing some small but dramatic changes.
And that's why they leaked all the internal polls that said Biden was losing New Mexico.
So I don't know what she's going off on about.
"Because you know, this Trump train don't stop."
"Bobby, it's sort of fascinating that Kamala seems to be struggling with younger minority voters versus Trump struggling with white women, suburban voters."
Those are unequivocal.
According to a recent poll by Telemundo and Mason Dixon Polling in Strategy.
"Shapiro expressed his unflinching support for Harris's strategy, praising her knowledge of the electoral context of the state as well as her efforts to communicate with people in places that are underrepresented."
Let's dig deeper into why Pennsylvania has such a pivotal role in the 2024 election.
But the top line is Harris plus point five.
"I think you were looking at the final three, none of them were really particularly that appealing."
To go digging around to find out.
"Tonight, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump both held campaign events in Pennsylvania, in Erie, Pennsylvania."
"Come on, man."
He's going to be our rep in West Virginia and he skateboards.
And so I was able to delegate her responsibility on everything from foreign policy to domestic policy.
"We can have our partisan choices for candidates, but the running of elections is something that really needs to be nonpartisan."
Harris is not ahead and even one.

"And be sure to tune in to the ABC News Presidential Debate, the first between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, September 10th, right here on ABC News Live."
"So when we go out there for the next two weeks, as we're getting our friends to vote, as we're helping our friends get to the polls, as we're talking to people about why we want to make Donald Trump the next president of the United States."
What's this message?
It's never been stated before.
"And so we have to demonstrate our power, our power through our voice and our power through our vote."
You're still finding Harris plus five.
"Yeah, and especially those undecideds not going to factor into their decision."
"This marks a substantial shift from previous polling in May, where Trump had a nearly 10-point lead over President Biden in some of these states."
"That's it for this one, folks!"
"As a young Democrat, that really matters to me."
And so those are issues that advantage either side poll show and they're divided right down the middle.
"Harris, in her bid to win over white voters, has worked tirelessly to reshape her image and bridge the gap on key issues, particularly fracking."
I want to get a little bit more of a sense of Harris's message for Michigan voters because we know that both Harris and Trump have spent a lot of time there in Michigan.
"And all of us are just like, what did we tell you?"
I chalk it up to a state level apparatus.
"Yeah, it certainly is."
Thank you for everything that you did.
"They know they obviously saw a lot of momentum going into that convention, but the worry and the question on most of the Democratic faithful's minds that I when I was talking to them in Chicago is how do we keep this going?"
"The interview has sparked controversy, with some commentators questioning why Vice President Harris needed Governor Walz by her side for the occasion."
"The COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted disparities in healthcare access, particularly in rural areas and among communities of color, which could play a role in how voters approach the upcoming election."
"And I think one quote that kind of puts that on full display, I believe it was Jeff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia at the DNC, who said voting for Kamala Harris doesn't make you a Democrat."
I love America.
"So some are even pointing fingers at her campaign manager, Nikki Liu, who say they say lacks a deep knowledge of Philadelphia, where Kamala must drive voter turnout in order to win."
"He's up in the polls in Wisconsin, which is unheard of because he always outperforms them by about six and Biden's the incumbent president at 45."

His name is Doug Logan.
"Pennsylvania, a state in flux."
The problem is I just think they're for a lot of Trump voters.
I like to call him Coach Walz.
"Former White House aide to George H. W. Bush, Joe Watkins, believes Shapiro should be at the top of Harris's list."
They target young black men.
I can't even get by here.
"During and after the debate, Donald Trump seemed to be on the defense."
We can see that it's clearly dead heat.
So I think the math around the state has changed quite a bit.
"Among independents, 48 percent are for Harris, while 43 percent are for Trump."
"One of the most important is the economy, particularly the state's manufacturing sector."
And they had an interview.
"The Trump camouflage oven mitt, the Trump football flask, the Trump pool float, not intended for use as a flotation device, and the Trump needlepoint flag belt."
"The interplay between urban and rural voters, the critical importance of turnout, and the historical context of voting patterns all converge to underscore the complexity of the state's electoral landscape."
How long do you expect it will it will take for us to know who actually won Pennsylvania?
It's all programming.
That guy goes out and parrots Trump's bullshit every day.
So like when they call- He's on the defense now.
That's where the unfavorable numbers on the Biden presidency are really coming from.
"Yeah, I think that's going to be a central question of this election because we've seen across the country since the overturning of Roe every time an abortion measure was on the ballot it has passed."
"I hate that kind of mentality, but as I close, I want to say this, shout out to all the rich white liberals in Pennsylvania."
"T on the outer banks were h the costs down there are roof, there's not enough so much that needs to hap get our gas prices down."
This election will be decided in the suburbs.
It's of course now mid-July and they're still going strong.
"And just for the sake of disclosure, we're talking about a poll here, specifically in Pennsylvania, a sample size of a bit more than 1,300 people, a margin of error, 2.7 percentage points, smaller than the rest."

"And that meant that he would definitely need Pennsylvania, and he looked far away from home in Pennsylvania."
"But also if you want to support the channel, you can do so by buying the merchandise from shop.readygopolitics.com which is also on the website."
Now what will happen is throughout the whole night on election night every single one of these counties will be all of them through all state they will be reporting in their election counts from all of the polling stations and all of these counties over here will be the first to report in and so as you're watching whatever station they'll be showing that Pennsylvania is red red red red red and everybody will start freaking out and that's because so many of these counties are reporting in and they're all reporting in huge numbers for Donald Trump but here's what you have to understand about Pennsylvania is that the total vote count in Pennsylvania in 2020 was about 6.9 million total votes cast and 43.2 percent of them came from this county and these counties right here.
Scott can you tell us a bit of what you're seeing now?
"The beginning paragraph here in this article says when Vice President Kamala Harris ruled out her economic agenda, she went to Pittsburgh."
You just got to believe what you want personally at this point.
"But despite her gains, she is still not equaling what Democrats usually get among non-white voters and young voters."
"That's kind of always the case, though, isn't it?"
And that puts him up four points.
They came up with nothing.
It's a doppelganger of what we've already seen.
Harris is not capturing these people and they will determine the outcome of the state and they will determine potentially the outcome of a couple of these House races and possibly the Senate race as well.

"Yeah, true."
"Because as soon as it's connected, those cells join together."
"Donald Trump's top surrogate, Laura Loomer, says, ""'Donald Trump lifted the ban on blacks and Jews ""'coming to country clubs in Palm Beach, Florida."

Everything looks very good for it.
So we did see that at one point the protesters besides chanting to get the ballots counted and get the results out.
What do you think we're going to see?

Part of that was because they wanted Trump to be up so they could pressure Biden to drop out its political strategy.

This was effectively his home state.
"I'm going to be with Senate candidate Dave McCormick on November the second, which is the final Saturday before Election Day surrounding the Ohio State Penn State game."
Now these counties here will report in earlier than Philadelphia because there are fewer people here than there are in Philadelphia and the thing to note is of all of these votes here in Allegheny in 2020 almost 65% of them went for Biden in this whole section here including Philadelphia it was about 66% of all the votes from this area went for Biden but in Philadelphia which is included in this number of the 66% but if you take this out and just look at Philadelphia 80% of the votes coming out of Philadelphia went to Biden and so when you look at 43% of all of the votes cast in Pennsylvania are coming from these two areas and that roughly 65% of all of those votes went to Biden it means that the state goes to the Democrat it's just the way that the numbers work out especially if there is a significant increase in the number of people voting in this area especially in Philadelphia and also over here in Allegheny which we expect to have happened in this election so come November when you're watching the election returns you are going to relax take a deep breath get out your popcorn and whatever adult beverages you might be consuming that night and you will just sit and watch the returns coming in from Pennsylvania and you will not care what is happening for the whole state of Pennsylvania until the Philadelphia metropolitan area starts reporting in and Allegheny County because between those two areas that is 40 it's going to be 43% of the vote and in fact I would say with the increase in voter participation for this particular election it could be anywhere from 45 46 48 percent of the entire vote coming out of those two areas and because the majority of the voters are voting for the Democrat this is why I predict Kamala Harris is taking Pennsylvania in this election it's just about the math
We have record.
What they do is incredible with the weaponization of government.
It's not even believable.
So how long you been doing this?
"Like, why would they report this?"
"All right, Jake, so in recent hours, Trump's been dealing with more questions, more talk and discussion over his cognitive health, comes as his campaign is really ramping up efforts to appeal to younger male voters."
And people are very committed and strunk.

"But again, I am somebody who obviously we know where I stand politically."
I don't think it paints a whole picture.
"I mean, possibly because I was in literally in the suburbs, so maybe that's why the targeting was there, but it seemed to me like that, I took note of the fact that it was so strong, so unified in that message from both of those candidates, from the Senate candidates, as well as the presidential candidates that clearly they've got a lot of internals, this is the main thing to go all in on."
And yet you look at what Democrats have done with just their few years in power.
It's Trump sign.
We didn't have to say it.
"And you see Trump's in-door seat, Mark Burns."

There's some wiggle room in there.
Vice President Harris and her team say she is fully engaged as well.
"Harris has been outlining her opportunity agenda, which includes key issues like abortion rights."

"And if they're not confident about Pennsylvania, how do you expect to win because of Trump's winning Pennsylvania?"
"So we're here with Jack, live at Butler PA."
So I'm looking forward to November.
And then now because we've lifted sanctions on Iran and paved the way for them to get a bomb.
"So there might be something kind of going on there where they seem to be really, really heavily in favor of Trump, especially for like Arizona and Georgia and those states in North Carolina."
We have some sick people.
"And look, Erie's also had some economic challenges over the last summer."
It reinforces what we heard a couple of days ago.
"And and look, this is the Twitter is the place where the president of the United States announced he was not going to run to hold his seat."
So we'll see how Pennsylvania shakes out.
"You know Western, Pennsylvania I'd love to hear what you think should be focused on I Think that's a very stark choice, and I think all of those things are embedded in that you know if you really if democracy is Important to you of course you know you know vice president Harris is going to be who you choice if you're talking about reproductive freedom for women of course obviously you're going to you're going to choose the vice president and if you're concerned about is somebody going to try to have an insurrection and and and Claim about you know rigged elections and things so definitely you're going to vote for for Harrison things But but that's why I can't understand why I personally would vote for that But I know a lot of people that are in an absolutely going to vote for Donald Trump and spend any time all across in small County, Pennsylvania You see a lot of support and there's a lot of energy there for Trump And I want people to understand that it's it's true And it's there and if we don't take it very seriously Then we do it our own peril on that the same message that I would have had Back the secretary Clinton, and I would like to remind the secretary Clinton She beat Trump in all three debates I was actually in the audience of that first debate and he absolutely Wooked him, but that really wasn't determinative in that race sadly Yeah, and so I want everybody to do on this I do believe that Harris is going to win and Trump is going to have a strong performance, too But I do not think it's going to change the underlying dynamic that I've already been discussing That it's since 2016 a senator John Federman."
But the reality is that's what they did.
So executive privilege is this idea that basically there's a zone of secrecy around the president and presidential decision making that protects information.
"And now, eight years after he was elected, after all the arguments against Obamacare have been proven to be wrong, and even folks who don't like me sure like that insurance, when he was asked about it, he said, well, I have a concept of a plan for how I might replace it."
Kamala has talked about it over and over again.
" As Kamala Harris courts voters in Pennsylvania, black Greek life is thrust into the spotlight."
But we got to take this to the finish line.
"David Patel â€“ $1,250,000 David Patel, a real estate magnate based in Pittsburgh, has contributed $1.25 million to Kamala Harris' campaign."
He was the seventh most bipartisan member of Congress during his time in office.
"Just send somebody in and say, Hey, JD Vance, he's running for vice president."
He doesn't know what to do He said he heard bad things about Kamala Harris while in a helicopter crash With Willie Brown a hard land helicopter crash really?
"Come to think of it, this might not even be a hey."
"You might not be able to win the counties, but just walking away from Democrats are going to stay home."
"The Jill Stein effect back in 2016, even though she didn't win any states, she got enough votes and some key places to maybe, you know, made a difference."
"Trump's 2016 promises to bring back jobs resonated strongly in the rust belt, and although his tariffs on steel and aluminum were popular with some voters, others became disillusioned as the manufacturing sector continued to struggle."
"And Chris, I have to ask you before I let you go."
That's why they have $370 million reserved in ads from now until November.
It might be.
So the country's immigration issue is something that affects people and their everyday lives here.
There's no question about it went Obama in 2012 when Trump in 2016 when Biden in 2020 the last two cycles just about 1500 votes each Separated the two candidates who we wanted to ask voters who have not made a firm decision yet who they want to vote for What they actually saw in this debate now These are voters that have in the past supported Republicans and Democrats they have in the past shown support for Former president Trump or for Joe Biden but coming into this night They told us that they had not made up their minds yet in this election So just to step back a little bit show our focus group to people Erie residents again Most important state most important County in that state We asked for a show of hands before the debate who hadn't made up their mind yet But thought this debate may determine where they would go with their vote to start With this debate.
How is he expected to be involved in the campaign?
The reality is that there are certain things that must be repeated to ensure that I have everyone know what I stand for and the issues that I think are at stake in this election.
"Just to barely win the presidency and even if you get to 69, that's not enough."
Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote and Donald Trump 47%.
"Niggas is tired of Trump, bro."
"The only one who comes out ahead in this was Pennsylvania Governor, Josh Shapiro, who has a 47 percent approval rating."
"Says it's a Swiss watch, but nobody can actually figure out where in Switzerland was this thing made."
You mentioned some of the attacks that they had for each other there.
So it couldn't be better.
"And I'm being generous more than likely if you have pollsters like Quinnipiac and New York Times pushing out crap like this, there's a good chance the polling miss is closer to two to three points."
"However, in 2020, Biden made significant inroads in the suburbs, particularly among college-educated voters, helping him reclaim the state."
OK we have a problem with this demographic.
This is where the majority of the votes are.
"So tell me about that coalition, his building of Hispanic voters, trying to attract black voters."
I'm from Brooklyn.
"Harris is pushing hard on this front, but she's facing some challenges too."
You meet people where they are.
So the 46 to 43 lead here is also very much in line with what we see on Quinnipiac of a 48 versus 45 point lead and then a 50 to 46 lead for Kamala Harris in the New York Times poll.
"But they they have a lot of synergy at the top of the ticket where Trump appeals to that working class, middle class union Democrat."
And America is not having enough.
"And I think that's even going to get closer, honestly, because you're starting to see liberal polls."
Because we do got the president coming up soon.
Thank you over there.
But now it's been trending Trump.
The International Olympic Committee says Boxers Yuting Lin from Taiwan and Iman Kelleff from Algeria are biological females.
"Look, since I took office as Secretary in January of 23, we have worked directly with state, federal, and local law enforcement agents, and we've had even folks from the counterterrorism information center here in Arizona and CISA out inspecting our places where we do this work across the state, getting our cybersecurity, physical security agents out there from CISA to give us information and then going out with Tiger teams to help put in the bulletproof glass, do the ramps, do the firewalls in their electronic information technology systems."
She's supposed to fucking be.
"He's been holding a town hall near Philadelphia, rallying his base in this crucial state."
"So please tap your screen now, subscribe and donate to The Real News Network."
"He said, he said January 5th."
"Yeah, they're very respectful."
But he's doing it.
Should we be focusing more on the polling in these states?
"Because before the video continues, we just wanna urge you to lend your support to TYT."
Three percent of voters are still undecided.
"Now, America is the home of the brave."
We were inside on election day and officials showed us their process and they're saying it's slow because they want this to be right.
Trump hears a shot and he looks and then all of a sudden he grabs his ear and he falls to the ground and the Secret Service rushed in.
Steely Dan's Peg is my Song of the Day.
And I think a lot of that did come from the fact that she did get that Trump endorsement.
Watch.
You can't take this seriously.
This is not one or two surveys displaying her with such an appalling margin.
"And they've urged Harris in private meetings to do more to turn out voters of color, which is strange because Kamala is a person of color."
What are the most important issues for you?
And then of course you know breaking with the old guard GOP you know head of the convention they decided to change the party the party book to basically next entitlement reform.
"And we understand that this was one of the closest states, most contested states of the 2020 election."
Despite what Democrats may claim about the current state of the race and how Harris is actually up by 50 points.
She did Fox News.
"Well, that's right, the former president was in Central Wisconsin courting voters at an airport hangar rally."
He has been trying to find a way to claim ownership of this issue without the liability.
They are undermining us as parents.
I'm not shocked that that has filtered its way to people's sense about the strength of the economy.
"I really want to know how that's somehow good news for Harris because if if the point error is the exact same, which there's a possibility it could be off even more right now because of the insane response bias."
"Yesterday, we heard Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina say on one of the Sunday shows, on several of the Sunday shows, the reason we need to go ahead is, we need to know where you stand."
"Also, the latest poll results are showing the same."
We'll see if they'll be able to knock off Jared Golden.
I gotta get out of the sun.
So let's go to Susquehanna.
"Trump tells some story about rich people and subsidies, but he's slurring his entire way through this speech."
Has the Harris campaign reached out to you or have you reached out to them?
And it's pretty funny to be on a bus that's wrapped in Republican voters against Trump.
My opponent barely campaigns.
"And when the vice president talks about her history as a prosecutor, for example, and who she was fighting to protect and who she was defending, taking on the big banks to get 20 billion dollars for homeowners who got screwed during the during the financial crisis, you know, taking on gangs who were smuggling people and drugs across the border."
"So the more you look at it, the more it becomes apparent that Trump's in a good position here."
The economy.
And I think that's what some people are worried about with the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania.
That's part of the oppo that sort of been flung back and forth in the race to journalists and conservative media.
And in this election.
"But look, I can talk about it."
Whoopi Goldberg for president.
"Because look, when you are running against somebody who should be a historically unpopular opponent, you do have to use that against him."
"And for the people with Latter Day Saints, and I will say that I think I'm at 88% in terms of level of popularity or whatever you wanna call it."
The big question right now for Harris is will Shapiro help her clinch the Keystone state come November?
"OK, even if that's the case, let's just say fine."
Perry Russum is in Washington.
I believe so was Nevada as well.
"But not only that, a couple days ago, we heard from not just people at the Trump campaign, but from the Harris campaign, their own polling."
These polls show just how unpredictable Pennsylvania is.
But we're not giving up the outdoor rallies.
"But Trump repeatedly refusing Harris, releasing her detailed medical records this weekend and asking Trump who would be the oldest president ever to take the oath of office why he isn't doing the same."
"So on election night, what counties will you Dr."
Let's get into it.
"Potential jockeying this summer, but with huge implications for control of Congress next year and for who is running swing states in that all important 2024 presidential race."
"That is good for Trump, but still the overall numbers spell it out."
"Came straight to the comments, someone said everybody wants to know, so he's not a lot of real favorable comments there, saying why don't you just show up on The View and have a nice slot there right next to Whoopi."
"Those include Harris County, Dallas County, Tarrant County and Collin County."
That was a soundtrack to my childhood for sure.
We're not getting.
Oh my gosh.
There's going to be more day of voting for the Democrats.
I'm just tired of it.
Because they want to suck up to their base and folks in their base who think the election was stolen.
We have a Democratic House and a Republican Senate.
So that part I'm a little skeptical about.

"I would be honored, Madam Vice President."
"Crooks, he just looked like that incel type teenager, early 20-something male that probably didn't have any friends, bullied, not great luck with the women and turns for whatever reason to violence and gets politically polarized and radicalized and all that."
"But no, he came back."
"Alright, Dan, thank you very much."
"And all of this is part of the Harris's campaign's efforts to do outreach to these communities, especially in suburban areas."
Our Natalie Brand spoke with voters in Pennsylvania about what it's like living in such a hotly contested state this election cycle.

"It caught fire with Democrats, so he brought it back last night."
"Oh, there certainly is not."
I'm excited for the season.

"So 22 K versus like one 30, that's a difference of around a hundred K Republicans lost the state by 81 K. So you're talking about a bigger difference."
"Would everyone else, even the Washington Post or even Franklin and Marshall, they're finding the race, you know, within the margin of error."
What's the plan there?
"And I would argue that that's the goal as well, that this is really an effort to cause people to disengage, give up, not participate in future elections because they don't have faith in the outcomes."
"Well, to be clear in Arizona as well, the Trump campaign has already been granted a motion to intervene in a state case over this Sharpie Gate conspiracy theory, as has the local Democratic Party here in the state of Arizona."

I think that's her big job on Tuesday night more than making the case against them.
A lot of it is tied to policy preferences.
So there really isn't that huge of an impact.
"So again, numbers guy, data guy, let's break this down by the math."
It's 2022 now.

Nevada has 6.
Do you think truly this can be staged by you because I see so many comments of people saying it is going the extra lens just to be able to get to vote from people and I think the part and the reason why people are saying that it is staged the most was because of the clip that has been going viral where it was telling the person trying to get him off of the stage to calm down so he can make the black feasts into the hair a black power feasts into the hair a lot of people are stitching that part and saying come on like if this is real and not staged it wouldn't have time to be doing all of that on that stage so let me hear what you guys think about all of this I am going to see you guys in the next one.
They're not going to break for Harris.
"He can't reassure us that the people counting the ballots are a mix of Republicans and Democrats and independents, since we're a state with a third, a third and a third."

"But at the at the risk of him endorsing Oz, it's not exactly what it is."
"I think that the current outgoing Republican, he went to be the president of a university and it opened up the seat."
I've been privileged to win an area every time I've been on the ballot.
That almost makes me know that they knew he was and I thought they've been calling the man a dictator and a tyrant and a Hitler.
And that's the issue that you're going to likely see keep coming up.
I've done it before and I'm going to do it again.
He's been so well spoken with the media.
It's still poison.
And look at all this Trump support.
It's still around.
"Again, if heels up doesn't win Pennsylvania, it's over."
That's not exactly a good sign.
But I will say no matter what as someone who's sort of on the right in conservative media it has been so ugly in terms of oppo who's falling on what side who is trying to undercut who really really quickly.
Can you believe it?
And Alina Habba was the person who spoke before Donald Trump.
He also took the opportunity to share this helmet with the audience.
You had to go through a secret service protected detail to get into this site and people were arriving here as early as 10 or 11 this morning.
She couldn't move on Friday.
The dynamics are very different on the ground than they were then.
"Yeah, it does feel like if they can't even get their strategy right in Philly, what hope do they have for the rest of Pennsylvania?"
" Welcome to our show, The Trump Briefing."
"Whoa, that's crazy."
53-year-old Amanda Stewart Sprouse is a mother of three who voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020.
"You know, it found a little less than 200, I guess, issues of concern that could be sort of possibly fraud, only for actually most of the level of getting into the criminal justice system, though."
"Starting from the beginning to the end, I love the point that every single creator made in this video."
So it says basically we got these counties said decided already.
There appears to right now be some kind of surge going on in terms of a bunch of like shady or right wing pollsters coming out.
They say you like to stick to your talking points.
Obviously it was one of the closest states in 2020.
"Okay, a relatively smallish county that we're all going to be watching and obsessed with on election night this year, Erie County in 2016."
"If you think prices are high now, Donald Trump's message is you ain't seen nothing yet."
What's the latest there?
Michigan has 15 electoral votes.
"But if you're a Democrat, you don't want to rely just on election day because if it's very high turnout on election day more than likely those voters are going to lean towards Trump."
"By God, I'll tell you, it's a means of supply and what they're running around here complaining in this and it's these radicals."
So now they're running him again.
"It would appear that, like, look at the mainstream media, how they talk about it."
So that's crazy.
"Over in Chicago, delegates are arriving for this week's Democratic National Convention."
"It's not the popular vote, it's the electoral college."
And then you have these other candidates.
"I'm sure you guys are feeling it, too."
I'll try to answer them on this podcast.
I'm guessing he hasn't did anything.
"Republicans only need to net five races, Kenneth."
"It may all come down to the electoral college, which rockets Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro to the top of the list."
"The clearest choice yet for Republican voters, Trump endorsing Arizona candidate for Governor Kerry Lake, who was taking on Karen Taylor Robeson, a Republican backed by Mike Pence."
I think it's the perfect ticket for that.
There's a moment that a lot of people are talking about this morning where the former president just stood on stage for 30 minutes awkwardly while a greatest hits of his favorite songs played.
And maybe I'll do a separate video on that.
A narrow one point lead for Trump here.
And not just any votes.
"Another thing I should also mention, historically speaking, Pennsylvania numbers are far pretty accurate."
"If a Harris-Shapiro campaign were to win in November, Shapiro would be the first Jewish vice president."
"I just, I can't believe how much he has bungled his own campaign."
And I purposely convened them.
"That's right, Jimmy, yes."
"Um, Donald Trump."
"Democrats gained only 5,000."
"But I'm really talking to talk Erie right now, which is 103.3, 105.5 and 1530 a.m. up there in Erie."
"And if even they're off by half of what they were back in 2020, let's just be friendly, let's be generous and say they've gotten better, even in that scenario, that's a Trump lead in their own polls."
And they both join me now.
"Now, they're known for their party affiliation data, which has been crazy accurate in predicting the popular vote like for decades."
We won't have official results until we have official results.
"But when I say Hannibal Lecter, they say, why does he keep mentioning it?"
"No, and it probably won't ever happen."
And I think she has done that in her economic policies that she's laid out.
"If he wins Ohio, like we expect by eight or nine points, there's not going to be that much split ballot."
We rescind it.
"Her support is driven by her commitment to social justice, racial equality, and environmental protection, all of which are central to Harris' platform."
We're not to the conventions yet.
He then asks the crowd if they like red meat.
"Shapiro beat, by 13 points."
"I'm not denying that, but funny enough, Axios actually looked into this."
So our pollster here at ABC thinks that it's basically on par with what we've seen before.
"So it doesn't escalate any further, but it is crazy."
"This is a chance to bring out that joy, turn the page and look to the future."
"It has a population of about 4,000 people, a fraction of the size of Springfield, Ohio, which has been the primary target of Donald Trump and J.D."
What do you say?
"And who do you think will win Pennsylvania in 2024, Trump or Harris?"
Donald Trump for America.
And I thank all of the leaders here for being a part of that.
This is what I know right now.
A judge has found Lisa Snyder guilty of two counts of first degree murder among other charges and rejected the defense's attempt to claim Snyder was not guilty by reason of insanity.
And I think Pennsylvania is aware of it based on polling that we're getting.
"And number two, we offered her an opportunity to sign an affidavit saying that and she refused to do so."
"Well, I was going to say, upon penalty of perjury is a real thing."
I actually criticize 60 Minutes a lot.
"I hope when we look years from now, we have, I want to say a million, 100,000 subscribers."
A huge loss.
So he's very effective in that you don't these are he's a radical that you don't actually you can't actually tell at first glance.
They need a real plan and they need to execute it flawlessly and they need to do it fast.
President Biden won this state just by 50% of the vote.
So this is just another one of those stunts that he will continue on through the campaign.
"You have these two counties, Erie, Northampt like you had in twenty twenty three."
It is a hand count that you guys are talking about.
"Good morning to you Rick Yeah, good morning, Rob an election day still three weeks away But as of this morning brand-new numbers more than 5 million Americans have actually already voted That's across well more than half of the states that pace is actually down from four years ago when Covid drove record early voting And while we don't know exactly who voted for whom yet We do know that that more likely Democrats are voting early than likely Republicans But check this out Republicans have actually picked up their pace from four years ago There were more Republicans voting early than last time around both campaigns Spending massive amounts of money and energy trying to reach their voters as you mentioned in our latest ABC News Ipsos poll a whopping 62% of people across the seven major battlegrounds That's nearly two-thirds of voters say they've actually already been contacted by either the Harris or the Trump campaign Nearly half said they've been contacted directly by Harris almost the same number exactly by Trump's campaign But the Harris ground game appears to be doing more to actually help voters vote 48% of those contacted by Harris say the campaign has offered assistance things like helping people register or figure out where to cast their ballots That's nearly 10 percentage points more than say the Trump campaign has offered assistance to them in a race where every vote matters Robin that's because turnout plays directly into campaign messaging down the stretch Rick Yeah, Robin, and here's the deal The race is basically tied a range of national polls have Harris up a point or two Maybe even a tied race the 538 point polling average two and a half points 2.4 points separating the two That means that so much of this campaign at this point It's not really about undecided voters as much it is about convincing your voters to vote at all that said we are seeing some movement In the polls Donald Trump trailing among independence by five points in our latest poll That's 49 to 44, but he was down 10 points among independence just a month ago This is a group that more often than not sides with the winning presidential candidate something both campaigns are aware of Robin And we're aware that we are three weeks out."
"But one thing's for sure, Pennsylvania is shaping up to be the battleground of battlegrounds in 2024. Who do you think will win Pennsylvania in 2024, Trump or Harris?"
We talked a few weeks ago in Tucson.
"But if you're Harris, these are bad numbers for her."
The Trump campaign tells me they have about two dozen in Pennsylvania.
He's a great gentleman.
And that's the way you're going to get Trump people to stop believing the big lie.
"If you believe, and I'm not coming to Joe Biden's defense at all."
" Joining us now is Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who was, who is the governor there in that state where you just had that spirited debate."
"With your permission, I'm wondering if you would be willing to share one passage in particular with us."
This is post-conviction.
It would be a huge pickup for Republicans because of the incumbency with the Democrats.
Help your friends and family members and neighbors and co-workers do the same because if enough of us make our voices heard we will leave no doubt about the election outcome.
What is clear is Governor Shapiro's neighbors and voters here love him.
Fast forward to now.
Now Trump is plus three in Pennsylvania and you do have the Senate very close with Casey only up by two over McCormick.
It seems as if pretty much everybody in this race is awful.
It's for fun.
He's listening to you right now.
"In 2020, Trump performed well with voters who showed up on election day, and he's hoping for a repeat performance this year."
Which I have very mixed feelings about.
"Well, this commentary really digs into some demographic shifts that are happening all over the country, which is really interesting."
"And I say, yeah, yeah, it was good, because it was my economy that I gave to him."
"He'll never vote for the Women's Health Protection Act, which is we tried to advance in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision."
Compared to past elections.
That's a daily news podcast from WYTF where the only agenda is you.
Brett tends to be tough on Trump.
"Every Sabbath, every Sunday, if you go to church, you go to church, you break bread, in remembrance of him, this is my body which I have given up for you."
He's up 4.7.
So we'll see how it works out for her.
"I'm going to stand up for this, you know."
"And I think at this point she can only go upwards by being herself, being moderate and being strong."
"Ms. Harris is an active member of AKA, the oldest Greek letter organization established by African-American college-educated women, and has said the organization changed her life."
"And if you disagree with them, talk to them about it."
"And all he did with it was give a tax cut to people who did not need one, and drove up the deficit in the process."
"Donald Trump, however, has lost roughly half a point since that initial dropout."
It's far from over.
"Well, just two things."
Prediction markets allowed traders to bet on the outcomes of real world events from elections to sporting matches to the weather.
Another disastrous speech by Donald Trump.
"And one of those states is, of course, your home state of Georgia, where the Georgia State Election Board approved a new rule that would require a hand count of the number of ballots cast on Election Day."
"But seriously, I mean, I'm interested in this because I mean, I don't even know how many dozens, hundreds of campaign events I have covered in my career."
"If you take a look at the graph here, losing the state immediately after the assassination attempt, the odds at which Joe Biden was going to win."
"By ensuring that mail-in ballots are subject to strict requirements, the ruling may reduce the number of ballots that could otherwise be counted for Democratic candidates."
"It comes as she's ramping up the pressure on Trump, questioning his age and mental fitness, challenging him to another debate."
Huge campaigns.
But clearly that's something that he personally has identified that works with with these supporters.
And so Trump is using this line that Dr. Oz is who can win the general election.
"In order to become president, you need 270 electoral votes."
Just how unusual is the process that is happening there that you were able to see today?
I have a concept of a plan to do the dishes.
I've been asked this question 10 times in the past couple of weeks.
"She pulled behind, but now all of a sudden everybody likes her and she's bringing new energy into the party."
I have to address this.
And other members of the Senate aggressively questioned him.
Where was Scott Perry?
"No cats, but married and childless."
But of course Latinos con Harris.
"And after Kamala Harris wraps up her remarks in Charlotte, she'll then head here."
Who demonstrate character?
And these are polls.
They have those industrial steel towns.
He's confused.
Maybe a lack of understanding about how things work in Pennsylvania.
"This weekend, the Republican Party of Arizona voted to censure some high-profile people in their own ranks."
You heard from other.
"I thought that was a pretty good thing for the economy, a pretty good thing for America."
He went into the lion's den.
"VP Harris here is saying to black men who she really needs to turn out, particularly in a place like Philadelphia down the street from where Trump is today."
Thank you so much for coming on this kind of insight.
We need to get people out to vote for Donald Trump.
Don't worry about it.
And I forget the other guy that we're getting back.
"All right, that is Mike Noble, CEO and founder of Noble Predictive Insights."
And now you've got the mail-in mail-in votes here declining significantly more 15%.
"So I hope we see another one, but yeah, we're going to do a live stream after the VP debate and hopefully another presidential debate."
I do not take any – people were dying.
"We welcomed Governor Waltz, the area a little while ago."
Following Tuesday's fierce face-off.
"Andrapal, thank you for your inputs."
So obviously Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are very well known figures in Pennsylvania.
President Trump hit the stage.
"And just days after Ms. Harris moved to the top of the presidential ticket this summer, every divine nine president pledged in a joint statement to meet this critical moment in history with an unprecedented voter registration, education, and mobilization coordinated campaign."
"A couple of weeks ago, his running mate had the nerve, the hook spot, to say that Donald Trump salvaged the Affordable Care Act."
We see the Trump campaign focusing on a Harris county that is just so densely populated that getting a small bump in the percentage there could make the difference in Pennsylvania.
"Actually, we are currently feeding only enough to satisfy our direct to consumer base as it remains somewhat constant."
Two of the most critical battleground states.
"In Georgia, Trump holds a slight lead."
Now an analysts have put two firewalls in place.
What does that mean?
She's looking very fancy with the hoop earrings.
It voted for a Democrat president for generations.
"She's super popular, especially in Philly."
"People were saying he based on how he's speaking, he's a retard."
"He would say, aren't we all Republicans here?"
"I mean, it was just fascinating to watch."
"Been a great governor, working with Democrats and Republicans to get stuff done."
"And we've expressed these points time and time again that when it comes to this community here, the things that they're looking for at this point, it's beyond the ceasefire."
I've seen him play like three downs.
You can't exactly do that.
" Our buddy Sean Parnell is back in the mix, everybody."
"They said it is so much better to be for for something rather than against something to be for the future, not going back."
"But no, he dropped out and endorsed McCormick, the worst candidate in the race, a train wreck, a globalist, a neoliberal Republican, who has been aligned with the left on pretty much every social issue."
Make sure that those benefits go to the people who paid for them and not illegal aliens.
"And yes, it was."
But Kamala Harris is right on this.
Who are the people in America who have the lowest vaccine acceptance rate?
Harris offered it to him Tuesday morning as campaign cameras rolled.
" Yo, so we're here live in Butler, PA at the Trump rally."
"Well, now they released a poll out of Pennsylvania that has Trump up by a point."
Right now we just saw a shift change between some of the governor's detail as we are working to find out when the governor will return here at home.
"Galen, always good to see you."
A stone newly discovered in a cave in Bucks County could prove it was a hiding place for the legendary band of 18th century outlaws known as the Doan Gang.
"Everybody bend your knees real quick, because sometimes when you stand too long, you get a little faint."
"Thank you so much for joining us, Congressman."
Lead is a poison.
"She's talking about investing in small businesses, putting money into small businesses and cutting taxes."
"And of course, cross tabs are a little wonky in all polls."
Just another sign of how important Pennsylvania is to this election into these campaigns.
Many of them had assault rifles just out in their hands.
He is someone who will stop at nothing to claim power for himself.
I can't even get started on the detrimental effects that the weather has had on the vegetation in our region this year.
"You can make an argument that well, it was the middle of the summer."
"As we talked about on Friday, when we were doing scenarios, it all comes down to electoral math."
"His play, therefore his playlist and there for the dance moves."
"They have a long legacy of, you know, half of the state is gigantic, as more in common with the industrial Midwest than it does with the East Coast."
"But again, CNN is done with her garbage."
"Oh, that's such a good question."
"He deliberately lies, and then he lies about his lies."
"Whoo, it's hot here."
"I mean, I can't even imagine what the big channels that cover politics all the time because everybody was live, by the way."
This great state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk the face of the earth.
"No, it's okay."
With politics aside fracking has been positive I would say all around.
You have no idea what he's talking about.
"You know, the amazing thing."
"I mean, you're the man."
"And then kind of like in the middle of his speech, Kristi Noem's like, all right, so here are the songs that you wanted us to play."
"And we know, we know and can assume that if the government offered her a plea agreement, they like what she had to say."
And you said there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking.
"Our top story tonight involves a tense exchange at the White House earlier today, where White House correspondent Peter Ducey questioned press secretary Kareen Jean-Pierre about Vice President Kamala Harris's shifting policy positions."
"The private polling, basically the same thing, actually a bit more friendly to Trump."
So that gap closing.
"It may be a win in Wisconsin, and it certainly will be a win in the state of Minnesota."
"When Joe Biden dropped out of the race, he was losing nationally by roughly three points."
Let's look at this endorsement draft that Trump drafted up here talking about.
"But this time around, I believe it's a must win state for Trump."
"And when you look around Pittsburgh, is the enthusiasm that allegedly Kamala Harris generated anywhere evident?"
You know what the problem is?
"The Trump campaign told Spectrum News it has paid staffers and volunteer-powered field programs in every battleground state, including Pennsylvania, and they are expanding daily."
"So yesterday I went to the swing state of Pennsylvania to the town of Zelia, Nopal to speak with word energy workers who say they don't trust Harris and her flip flops on fracking."
 Pennsylvania is the most pivotal battleground in the race for the White House.
"In other words, this Harris plus point four is nothing."
I watched Marco over the weekend on television.
It's out of our favorite pollster.
He has no hope of winning instead of the states.
And what I'm trying to do is use a platform that I have and urging the vice president to chart a new course on what's happening.
"Yeah, I get that."
"The optics with this guy, it's just, he keeps posting W's, but the big W that is make or break is on November 5th."
But we've got to fight like the Democrats do in order to win.
It might ultimately come down to which candidate can deliver a new RV to Clarence Thomas first.
How did he do?
There was a woman in Scottsdale who is accused of casting a ballot for her dead mother as well as for herself because her mother died before the early ballots were sent out and then a ballot was voted on her behalf.
"OK, so Lisa, how are Republicans responding to all of this?"
You can see a little bit of it behind me.
Freeport.
He's not thinking about you.
"It's not so much that we agree with her, but we simply cannot deal with a minimum of four more years of that."
But now I'm in women's land because I am a Harris supporter.
"Personally, it was likely gonna come down to two people, Dr. Oz and David McCormick."
All of the polls look good.
"Uh, this is another interesting trend."
Central to Stierwald's analysis is the concept of voter turnout.
Harris and Trump are tied at 47% when voters are asked who they trust more to handle abortion-related issues.
"You've had four years, Pennsylvania."
"So please, if you don't like Donald Trump, totally get it."
Elections are very complicated.
I think next week is the week it all falls apart and people start distancing themselves from her.
"Let's all pray for the Trump family, and I will be back on later with more updates."
There's no logic to it.
"Doesn't exactly inspire confidence, does it?"
We did great in 2016.
And this is over 700 people.
"He's going to ask Congress for a 10 percent raise for the Border Patrol agents, as well as a $10,000 retention and signing bonus."
"Even Georgia, he can afford to lose Michigan."
We'll see news app today.
"But what I do think is interesting, both North Carolina and Arizona are similar in that they're battlegrounds where the Republican is favored, but they have unpopular candidates on the ticket."
"You are believed to be, sir, in a very tight race."
Your reaction to yesterday's verdict?
The city.
My work is centered on ensuring that that next generation has far greater opportunity and far less difficulty and being as American as they can be.
"OK, so Canada, Kamala Harris will be back in Pennsylvania for the second time this week."
Are you ready to go?
This makes sense because basketball and soccer are more popular than women's boxing.
I think he was already the president for four years.
And it's showing in this particular poll.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Let me look this up really quickly.
But.
Also the Democrat gains on Trump but hasn't closed the gap.
"He clearly has these tendencies, strongman tendencies, but he is also saying that if he gets reelected, he will, he intends to act against his political opponents."
"Well, as others in the videos have mentioned, we received, my secretaries would say, in excess of 20,000 emails and 10s of thousands of voicemails and texts which saturated our offices and we were unable to work, at least communicate."
Druid Hills is way too close to Atlanta.
It's sort of like a microcosm of all of America.
But it's especially weird when you consider what Trump had to say last week.
Then he was supposed to return on March 4th and the like.
Former President Donald Trump is holding a town hall with Latino voters.
"He would help us maybe a point, but it's not enough."
I don't know why he's imagining Kamala Harris as his wife in some weirdo bizarro thing that he shouldn't be talking about at all.
This is a live shot of an actual audit of the actual physical ballots that were cast.
"And look when I see clips like that and I read the comments that you send me a lot of the growth here at the Midas Touch Network is because this is a place where you have independence, where you have progressives and liberals, where you have real conservatives, where you have mainstream Republicans, where you have Democrats, where if your focus is normal."
It comes as inflation and interest rates come down.
"You have the Democratic candidate, John Federman."
That was like very cool.
"After that, Jen Fifield from the Arizona Republic was banned by the cyber ninja auditors from posting any further updates."
etc.
Not even did he manage to win it by a clear margin.
He was a brave man.
"And so I don't even venture a prediction, but I suspect we'll be at equilibrium for a while."
He's left the door open for pretty much any time from now until that big event in order to make that big announcement.
"Hillary Clinton, how'd she do?"
You can lose Nevada.
That's all he's not talking about what his plans are.
"And Donald Trump told ABC six, he was bragging about terminating Roe v Wade."
The race is on for both sides to define themselves and each other in what feels like a brand new race.
"And then in 2020, I said the same thing when polls really thought that Joe Biden was gonna have five points."
In this economy.
Great point.
"Yes, we will teach all history, the good and the bad, because we can't know where we're going unless we know where we have come from."
And that's why we're one of the battleground states and probably one of the most important states of this election year.
"The argument is, as we heard from Jim Clyburn, we need to know whose side you're on, which side are you on."
Let us all help our golden king break the spell and go on with his magnificent life.
And maybe we could ask them to come on up.
"A lot of them are from New York, New Jersey, Maryland, areas where they're historically more blue."
Democrats have gone down every day.
The heightened security measures underscored the volatile political climate and the very real concerns surrounding Trump's safety.
This is the aim crowd trying to make sure they stay the aim crowd I say it's time to upset the apple cart.
He's been senator there for quite a while.
"Well, Chris, thanks so much for being here today."
"So both Alyssa Slotkin, who's running for Senate as a Democrat, and Kamala Harris have said both, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive."
And yet what we watched unfold last night is ultimately a likely Kerry Lake victory.
I care about our national security.
You want to win the champion.
"No, I haven't thought of that with transitive property."
I think that gives opportunity for a better interview.
"This from Suffolk, a B rated pollster, likely voter 914."
"So that's heading in the right direction in the sense that there's zero evidence, but still two thirds."
"The stakes of this election with the statement being made by Donald Trump, I felt like I had to be here."
And don't forget to follow us on Spotify and turn on episode notifications so you're never out of the loop.
I think she needs to clarify her policy on immigration more and her policy on health care more because I don't think she's really laid that out correctly.
"Obviously, at that point in 2016, we did know who was going to win Pennsylvania."
Tell me about yourself and how you came to like Donald Trump.
Enforced savings.
Not at all.
Democrats have done it all to themselves.
"Dan, do you buy those polling numbers?"
"It's not necessarily that I was you know You know prescient before anybody else, but it was just so it was just so yeah, right It was just so obvious to me by what I was seeing and I think the two main things that I saw was that Before the 2016 election even happened."
"We've seen crime increase in inner cities in Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh."
People we never had in our country like this.
"The third poll was conducted between September 16 and 19th by Redfield and Wilton Strategies among 1,286 likely voters."
I get that.
He says he's an independent.
The state has been called the keystone of the Electoral College.
"But when they asked me to have an official hearing, we establish it by protocols, public notice, et cetera."
"Oh, that's such an interesting fact."
"In the US right now, I'm pretty sure it's like 100K, but I could be wrong."
"So they remain as it is, but it really is the seven swing states which hold the key to the US elections."
All he does is talk about himself.
No one flip-flopped more in the Senate.
"If you look at the graphic, it's been pretty stable."
"I don't know where she gets this because for four years, Donald Trump was the president of the United States."
"And they're talking about, oh, it was staged and it was faking."
And this is an important event for the Democrats as they try to win Pennsylvania and try to win the White House.
Donald Trump is perplexed by the concept that two weeks ago he was talking about President Biden and now he's talking about Vice President Kamala Harris.
"The diversity of this state is a major factor, making it the focal point of election campaigns."
"You have others that are a little more maybe a little more social liberal, the Harris."
I don't know why that's the case.
"If you look at what the Arizona Republican Party's been doing, not just, you know, terribly recently since the election, but over the past several years, they've really been doubling down and doubling down and doubling down yet again on the most fervent part of their right wing base."
His children go to a Jewish day school.
So we have a equal opportunity in this America in this country So that's a good thing for us.
One of the biggest reasons I'm voting for Kamala Harris and I would have voted for Joe Biden is that they are not Donald Trump.
"But there's more to this, check this out."
I'm in the scene.
A sitting president on a union picket line.
"By six point three, Wisconsin was meant to be assigned to Biden."
"Before her rally tonight, Vice President Harris visited a local black-owned small business for a conversation with black men from the Erie, Pennsylvania area after visiting with black farmers ahead of her remarks in North Carolina yesterday."
"So our motto at earlyvoteaction.com is to meet the voter, to get them registered to vote, to follow up with them and actualize them."
That's heading faster and faster toward a cliff that keeps getting higher and higher.
"Well, last night was a testament to where the voters are remaining today."
Absolutely not.
"No, i'm good Thank you so much."
"Hey, everyone."
He's cut taxes for middle class families in Minnesota.
McClelland and Shapiro's office did not respond to requests for comment.
What what about tonight?
They both are freaking straight out of central casting for what an assassin of the president looks like.
Quinnipiac has Trump losing by two.

The gross misinformation purposely put out by the county and the Associated Press.

And what's the issue with her?

"Like, what are we doing?"
"We are going to be talking about in this video, but it is important that we cover the fact that Donald Trump is pulled ahead in the state of Pennsylvania for the first time in a while that is with an outlier in there a Biden plus eight outlier."

But two thirds of Trump voters say that it is not.

But I don't know what happened to him.
Trump's averages in the state seem to have solidified in Georgia slightly ahead of North Carolina and Arizona which would put him at about 262 electoral votes but still shy of of course what he would need.
Tammy Baldwin is also not up by 12 either.
Now where is the majority of the vote coming from?
" Ladies and gentlemen, we've got more important early vote data."
This would be a 3-point overperformance for Harris compared to Biden's winning margin in 2020.

Who's the last Republican you supported?
"And at that point, if he just wins even Nevada, he's got the presidency."

"""'Trump is blacker than Kamala Harris will ever be.'"""
I'm the father of IVF.
That is also for all minorities.
to Dave Thomas.
We do appreciate that.
So they're going to be here duking it out to get these votes.

All of you.
"But this source, it points to voter turnout as something really important to watch, especially among young people and minority groups."

It's amazing.
"I understand just how critical jobs in the natural gas industry are here in this commonwealth, particularly for our building trades in the southwestern part of our state and elsewhere."

Something like four and a half out of the seven days that week she's returning.
"I said, let's calm down."
We'll play out the video in full.
"The state's political landscape has undergone dramatic transformations over the past few election cycles, often mirroring broader national trends."
"2017 Republicans are plus one, a seven point swing from 2020 to 2024."
And so any women and they were o vote for specifically bec candidate in Kamala Harris to anybody like that?
"And that comes from this post, which is this liberal person talking about the Democrats and their current firewall plus 294 K saying they're around three fourths of the way to getting 400 K, which doesn't make a lot of sense."
"While for Harris Waltz, it is merely a lot more difficult on election night."
It was a very good four years for the American people.
Depending on which way those votes go.
"But this is another lean GOP poll here for Trump, lifting him up and ahead of Harris now in the race to 270, with 198 electoral votes to 196."
They do not want to specifically talk about any of Trump's legal woes.
Now we talked to some Bay Area voters ahead of tonight's debate and one person told us Trump's rhetoric specifically around immigration is too divisive.
What happened?
"What is it about specifically Allentown, your county, your region, that has these candidates in such a tight race, do you think?"
Well in the meantime in August he went on CNN and he talked about why he was you know going for Kamala Harris instead of Donald Trump even though he is this local Republican leader.
They're anxious.
So yeah things look good.
This we're looking realistic here.
Okay Thanks for watching outspoken with Bruce and gaitos tap to watch more from KTR news and click the button in the middle to subscribe
"What we do know, and I thought Kamala Harris prosecuted this case effectively, is that Trump would just give Putin and give Russia exactly what they want and would make that entire region less stable, would put NATO at extraordinary risk, NATO countries and our allies at extraordinary risk."
He didn't even lose by that much.
And the fact that Trump shows up just it's he's leading by example on on every single front and he's showing up when he knows it's going to be emotionally taxing and difficult.

What's your overall message about the election generally and your election in Pennsylvania?
"And then Kamala made the way that the Gold Star families were treated at Arlington across the river from where I'm sitting in Washington, D.C., right now."
I put it at that.
And she's used it to grant amnesty to millions upon millions of people who have no legal right to be in the country.
The new poll today from the New York Times hasn't been added in to the Wisconsin average.
Trump's argument is that Dr. Oz is who can win the general election.
Currently Trump is in the lead.

"Whatever you do, you have to vote and make sure your ballot counts."
I honestly think that he used to understand how tariffs work.
"Yeah, and the economy is something that has been the top issue throughout this campaign There's a lot of frustration still from a lot of voters about inflation Even though some of those numbers have come down more recently."
They're still trying to kill him.
"Register voters, get them out to vote."
"A red county right next door, by the way, to Lackawanna County."
"So I find it very interesting that the Biden campaign, they're launching this six figure ad by, you know, where they highlight Trump essentially slamming Haley over and over again."
"I'm convinced that we are gonna win the White House, the Senate, and the House, and we're gonna have a very aggressive agenda to get the economy going again, to help everyone."

They made some nice offseason moves.
A Pennsylvania Democratic strategist said that Lew empowers a culture in the campaign that has left officials feeling unengaged and disrespected.

"Well, everything is on the line."
John Verone-Lopez has this report.
Pacey supported Nikki Haley but won't vote for Donald Trump.
"But here's a question to ponder, can Harris's newfound momentum in the suburbs of Pennsylvania and among younger voters carry her past Trump's formidable base?"
So you just going to go do it.
"And then there's a kind of thematic rhetorical one, which I think has been central."
He has a very high floor.
She's given hardly any interviews thus far.
These are not traditional places that Republicans go.
"Well, think about this."
"You have Brandon right over there, who's a leader for a long time, brilliantly the leader."
Listen right in the middle.
"Because we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God."
"Okay, let Trump's running mate, JD Vance, he still won't give a direct answer on who won in 2020."
"Although the child tax credit, the fact that that even JD Vance is disingenuously saying he's he'll do five thousand dollars."

"Obviously, Biden, it was his birth county."
"So he's very clear that he's obviously going to try to steal the election again, just like he did last time."
At the top left of the screen there's also a Discord server if you go ahead and join.
They just don't want to go back to the chaos of the Trump years.
"It's about who we are, how we treat each other, the example we want to set for our children and their children."
"All right, let's keep going down here."
So that's a big deal.
"So when Trump said the word black jobs, remember they lambasted him for that."
a national political debate for every on federal election and The Supreme Court did what they're supposed to do and kicked that down to the states That's a state's rights issue and that's where it belongs.
"Okay, we always get complaints about it, but no, Politico says no, no, no, no."
Their misses are awful.
"That was in the 80s, but within years the plant shut down, snuffing out thousands of jobs that were the town's economic lifeline."
But I think it's not fair to blame the media for insufficient coverage.
So this was great in my humble opinion.
He said she's an African-American woman who won office last year on a tough on crime message and when help Harris went over disillusioned black voters and working class white men.
"And then this old plaque of Elvis Presley said, Hernker, Hernker, Bernier, Lierd, Merlick, Hernker, Hernker, Bernier, Myrtle."
"But I think we're going to unleash, with Trump as president for a second term, a golden age of prosperity for Arizona and the whole country."
"Well, look, what I'll say is that in the 24 hours after Taylor Swift made that endorsement on Instagram, the voter registration site, vote.gov, said it saw 400,000 plus people visit it."
We're tired and exhausted with it.
Every time you motherfuckers.
Why did this dead end there?
"But you look at Erie County and you look at Northampton County, it's roughly in line with what those polls are showing."
This is where you see Pennsylvania and the Rust Belt states move in unison in favor of Vice President Harris.
He'll secure our borders.
We have to talk with the 2024 presidential election because it appears that Donald Trump's in a great position to win the swing state of Pennsylvania.
"Mr. President, please don't let the United States become Brazil, my native Brazil."
No.
We will never give up.
And that's not exactly something that's all that solid.
"All right, we see Harris, Heels Up Harris is an average lead of 0.6 percent."
That the whole election could be decided here.
But here are some of the comments.
But the fact of the matter is it always finds its way back to about as close to a tie as you can get.
This is really a big line for Republicans right now.
Make sure you follow me on X.
"Republicans gained around 19,000 new voters."
But even they found Harris up by only three.
That I'm more uncertain of.
You are by no means middle class and it's crazy.
And the article really highlights that.
What did you make of the vice president's performance?
"But in this case, the president, the former president is still throwing these temper tantrums."
Follow the social media accounts in the description down below.
"I was here in 20, 2022."
And he did that.
"She basically said that they were all talk, no action."
"But they reached out to Liu for this article and she's like, I'm visiting."
Now there's more.
I think we're going to talk about one of those issues in a minute.
What do you want to see in terms of change?
"A very accurate Donald Trump impression, actually."
"Then the polls are close and the Republicans and the Democrats have spent a lot of time, money and energy in Pennsylvania trying to get the state to swing their way."
I know people want us to talk about how to make their lives better.
A lot of people talk about the shy Trump voter.
It's the content or the statements being made in the middle of those rambling sessions.
They are surging.
"But no, they don't care because they're trying to even not talk about the gas powered car bands and the EVs."
The president is okay.
"As you say, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear 46 looks like the future as one Democrat put it to me, but Vice President Harris with Governor Beshear, a real picture of the future."
Here's some of the photos.
So we went on the ground from Baltimore to Pennsylvania to document two radically different approaches to picking up votes in otherwise hostile territory.
I believe in America and we need to get our country back.
"But even if there's a one point miss, a two point miss, which is, by the way, much more accurate than 2020, which again, in 2020, in September of 2020, excuse me, it was Biden plus four."
That is what Republicans have unleashed on Vice President Harris.
Donald Trump gets lost telling a story about marble columns.
And you better be wearing that outfit because it's going to become iconic.
I cannot provide content that promotes a specific political party or a specific candidate.
The Cash App link is in the description.
"Before we dive in, let me know."
"The findings reveal that Vice President Kamala Harris is polling at 46 percent, while former President Donald Trump holds a slight edge at 47 percent."
It reinforces that you're weird and you're a rambler.
And what would you hope to take away from this whole situation after the rally is all said and done?
"Where these other Trumpers at, man?"
We're not reading the articles here.
I wanted to reflect that there are people that have different opinions and I just thought that was a good opportunity.
"We talked so much about Senator Sinema, but there's somebody else in Arizona, another Democrat, Mark Kelly, he's up for reelection this year."
He's already talked to Putin.
"And yet when he has the opportunity to express power, he decides not to pass some comprehensive and less expensive health care plan, not to add jobs, not to pass the infrastructure law, not to pass a middle class tax cut, but use all of his political capital solely for a tax cut for millionaires and billionaires."
Right now there's a lot of young people in Philadelphia and elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that are feeling that pressure.
Ohio used to be a swing state.
And I think she has the capacity to do that with her small business programs and her commitment to put a Republican in her cabinet.
"But that's okay, because what I have to say is going to make so much sense that even if I'm coughing a little bit, I think you're still going to catch what I'm saying here, because here in Arizona voting has already started."
So there's a coordinated attack happening on specific polling markets.
" Harris, mistrusted in PA, Keystone State."
"Like I said, they're probably more used to than just about any place in the country having reporters come in and ask them questions before an election because we always do it."
And Casey made as much of that as he could.
"But of course, there's room to change people's minds."
"It's like she's absolutely capable to to have that message But what I'm committed to doing is I'm going to keep showing up and letting people understand that it's like hey You know I I stand with with the vice president just like I stood with with Joe Biden throughout all of this and I believe that Kamala Harris is going to prevail on this I really want people to understand I don't have anything different to say between now and 2016 that We all have to understand that it's going to be incredibly close and all of the things that's happened and all the Scandals and everything that hasn't that hasn't have any impact on Trump and here's where we are And now let's just hold hold the line between now and November And it's going to be very close and I do believe we are going to prevail in all of these things is it a pro-democracy Message freedom message is it an economic message that will win, Pennsylvania I know you don't want to give her advice, but you know the state well."
The series of explosive noises shuttered through this crowd.
"Donald Trump left office with net loss of 3 million jobs, with a 6.3% unemployment rate, with an economic contraction of 3.4%."
"Obviously, election day is a lot more Republican than in the midterms, where Republicans did better."
This is not a plan to bring down prices.
"But Nevada, obviously it's a little bit less."
"I really, if Trump was able to stretch a victory, a margin of victory in Pennsylvania by three and a half McCormick wouldn't be able to get, you know, get pushed over the finish line by like a point, a point and a half or something like that."
Who will be her running mate?
It's opposite.
And so I had a lot of conversations with them.
"Look, you don't have to agree with everything that I say."
You want to be a hippie?
"People don't love Dr. Oz, although he does in polling have a decent chunk of the vote."
"It did not look good for her favorabilities, for how people perceived her X, Y and Z until she was actually put in the position where the national spotlight was on her."
The infrastructure investment is about defending freedom.
"And if she doesn't get North Carolina for her, it basically comes down to Pennsylvania."
I literally got to the end of this part of the line.
There's no changing their minds.
"You know, Governor Walz is somebody who has that background."
It's down there to lawyers to represent the illegal immigrants that come into our country.
"Chris, polls did not seem to show much of a post debate bump for Vice President Kamala Harris."
The job of the media is to educate the American people on the issues that matter most by asking good questions.
"Hi Alex, all right, let's talk about this Keystone State."
"In conclusion, Donald Trump's recent legal victory in Pennsylvania is a significant development that could have far-reaching implications for the 2024 presidential election."
"In terms of former President Trump, he is I mean, he's going all around the country holding tons of rallies and he's sticking to this message that, you know, Kamala Harris will destroy this nation if she's elected."
"And that is maybe part of the equation, suburban women who used to be Republican who may be trending left."
"We must honor tribal sovereignty, embrace our trust and treaty obligations."
"But, you know, they're not trying to right now expand the party."
"Dr. Hannibal Lecter, he'd like to have you for dinner."
"And Harris' trip to Arizona continues on Friday, where she's expected to meet with 100 or 150 people from the group Arizona Republicans for Harris."
Arizona really seems to be trending.
The number one issue for me is we gotta protect our homeland.
Local media has reported the explosion was caused by a bomb carried by the lone fatality.
"If we immobilize that group, we win."
"But if we believe in freedom, then we should at least agree that such a deeply personal decision should be made by the woman whose body is involved, not by politicians."
"Joining me now is Pennsylvania Democratic Congressman, Krista Luzio."
"And clearly, former President Trump believes that immigration, he keeps hammering Vice President Harris on immigration."
Was that hard?
This level of frustration and finger pointing is not normal.
"I know a lot of people, I seen some, I didn't understand."
That's personal experience too.
"And Biden's totals among all demographics in terms of his popularity, his favorability, they have tanked completely across the board, which means turnout is likely going to decrease and you see that in these primary states and it's true."
It's one of the most important messages of the entire campaign.
And Secretary of State have a say in how elections are run in their state.
"He couldn't possibly have a decent proposal for healthcare, and he knows it, right?"
What is this ideology?
That is Kamala Harris's community.
We're going to make it better than ever.
That's why he's not connecting well with people because he can't connect well with himself.
"But once it switched from Biden to Kamala Harris, they backed out."
"I mean, I think she should face a level of scrutiny she doesn't often face because she doesn't do a lot of hostile or confrontational interviews."
"Whether people believed it or not, she couldn't have won being against fracking."
"And so when you entice him that way to talk about himself, instead of talking about the American people and how he's going to help them, it's something that we've come to know is just part of his problem."
I'm excited to hear that both of you are voting.
Do we believe in freedom?
"On the other hand, Donald Trump only got slightly over 80% of the votes, about 460,000 votes."
An arms embargo needs to be imposed in order for us to bring him to the table so we can put resolution to this conflict that's unfolding and hopefully put forward a just solution in establishing a Palestinian state to end this conflict once and for all.
We will never give in.
"Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will take their bus tour through central Pennsylvania this week, making multiple stops across the state."
What the hell do you need to be working for go home?
"I would hope that he would condemn this, but I haven't heard a word about condemnation."
"During the January 6th insurrection, he was outside the Capitol."
But it has been fascinating to me how much more information flows from both sides on social media.
You can play a big part in spreading the word about the morning agenda while helping us reach more people like you.
"Tax Network USA, a nationwide tax firm, has helped taxpayers save more than $1 billion in tax debt."
We can start with what's happening in Pennsylvania.
"And yet, a lot of the response to it from his supporters was to just agree and not really bad an eye about it."
"This state has historically been a key battleground in presidential elections, with its diverse electorate reflecting a range of political views and priorities."
Oh my goodness gracious.
I'm ready to watch Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris is making clear that she gets how to win Pennsylvania.
And my apologies if I've said his name incorrectly.
And I wrote just a couple of things then and I'm looking at that and I'm comparing it to what the Latter Day Saints think and liberty.
The state's electorate includes a significant number of union members and working-class voters who have historically supported Democratic candidates.
They like the way he handled the I-95 collapse.
Now that doesn't mean the Democrats are definitely going to win.
I think Biden's gonna come back and he's gonna retake the nomination of the DNC.
Harris plans to introduce her new running mate at a rally this evening in Philadelphia.
"Ozzy, we kept mentioning that Vice President Harris is now leading in national polls, but this election will most likely come down to a few battleground states, including Pennsylvania, where she and President Biden are today."
Jackie's politics are also rooted in family.
That we'll see.
"Biden was already challenged behind Trump in our state for numerous reasons, including putting a ban on liquid natural gas exports in our state."
They're funny guys.
We call them exurban areas.
You'll be watching tonight.
Or abortion.
They just see families.
100%.
"I mean, if Cleveland Cliffs or any domestic company were to buy US Steel, but not for enough money to continue operating those big mills, you would see workers losing their jobs anyway."
"We are going to crisscross this commonwealth talking about the stakes of this election, talking about how our fundamental rights and freedoms are on the line."
"But in these closing days, that has been notable as we're getting closer to the election."
"But in addition to that, of course, former president was just here in Georgia last night at a rally just outside of Atlanta."
"I genuinely projected Joe Biden's 306th and 232nd electoral vote triumph in 2020, and today I have to admit that this election is quite different."
Why is he talking about Arnold Palmer's penis in front of Pennsylvania voters?
"There are seven states that are considered swing states, meaning they could swing either way and have done so in the past few elections."
"How political talks is so, so, uh-huh."
Shapiro believes that Harris is the best candidate for the state.
I saw the crowds of Rochester yesterday.
Let people know what's up and it's so important.
We've seen massive polling errors in Wisconsin.
New York Times has Trump up by five in the state.
"This has been... Hey, what the hell?"
It was 28 or 29 last couple times.
Conclusion.
"163 K you've gone from 560 K to 160 K. Basically a huge difference there of 400,000 less in terms of the Democrats advantage over the Republicans."
I want you to listen to her over the weekend.
She has been consistent about this.
And that's basically what Wisconsin in and of itself tends to boil down to in the polling department.
"Like, how's it looking?"
We've covered that ad nauseam.
There's no answer there.
Please be safe.
"You had the two huge polls yesterday, national liberal polls that loved Biden in 2020."
A legislator can hold a group meeting.
"I remember reading that about, I don't know, a month ago."
I had no idea that that was the next thing in there.
Or what's it look like right now?
What is middle class like 75K?
It was Shapiro who mentioned specific policies that have been advantageous to the working-class people in the United States.
I'm out of here in January anyway.
"He picked, who was it?"
So he comes to you from the common sense perspective and then he comes to you from the business perspective and real people can recognize that we see what's going on.
"But they only won for Vice President, former Vice President, now President Joe Biden, won that county by only 4%."
"Again, it's hours until the library opens up."
"Kamala already worked with Joe Biden to take on the drug companies, bring down the cost of insulin."
"Again, the University of New Hampshire has Harris up 5 points among almost 2000 likely voters, 52% to 47%."
Will you just give a thumbs up or type Y if you can hear me?
But I think what what that clip shows you is how far some candidates are willing to go to genuflect to you know who?
 We're going to go now to Gotti Schwartz.
"And he says that the migrants who are there lawfully are actually illegal immigrants, spreading more racism and xenophobia."
"Philadelphia, the state's largest city, is a democratic stronghold, with African-American voters making up a large portion of the electorate."
Of course they didn't have that much time with her.
"It's quite the divide, 50 to 34 percent."
"Well, what you're talking about, Brianna, there is the draft report."
"And sure, it recovered to something more reasonable."
"And yeah, that's the type of president we need."
"The fact that Trump's tied according to RCP, and that's what two horrendous polls, I mean, Quinnipiac, we all know their garbage."
So it's like this false narrative that's being pushed.
So it was more about actually being particularly accurate and not the other way around.
But how does that impact the race?
We want to be tough on immigration.
And this has happened a number of times.
"But Shapiro, I think whoever she chooses to be a good person to go alongside her."
I've been in the oil field.
South Carolina is a place that picks presidents.
President Biden should just move out now because Republicans and cyber ninjas have fixed the problem of Trump apparently losing the election.
Let me get my shoes.
Democrats fret that any mistake here could tip the election.
"We polled it, we got like a statistical tie in Arizona."
Harris leads this poll by four points.
"I mean, we she helped write the Green New Deal, which is anti energy, anti fracking, anti energy."
So he's not winning based off getting 50s.
"It's not, it's not happening."
I'm still kind of in a shock.
"Thank you so very much, Secretary Hobbs."
"I see from people Indiana's primary Donald Trump got 78% of the vote against Nikki Haley in Indiana that prompted a lot of people to claim that oh, well Trump is having a lot of Republicans defect from him."
I'm not saying they're dead on.
"And sometimes I didn't live up to those values and I made mistakes, and I tried to learn from them."
"And here we are in a situation where once again, an argument needs to be made by men in order to reach men."
So I'm happy happy story.
People are ready to win and are ready to help deliver this ticket.
My colleague Ben Wasserstein caught up with some GOP crossovers in Lykaster County.
She's very visible across the country.

We would expect Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to go to Trump.
And that's why we did two events there.
Republicans have to decide for years.
I love the world.
We'll play YMCA Trump kept DJing and most of his supporters stayed for another 30 minutes of his place People Inside the hall seemed to like it very much at the end Trump did something he rarely does he came down off the stage and Mangled with the crowd shaking hands and chatting with people.
"But you might be saying, well, it's the polling."
"Yeah, I mean, just imagine all 67 counties in Pennsylvania and every voter on an Excel spreadsheet."

"Yeah, you have."
"Having Trump, former President Trump, back in president, having his hands on the buttons of controls makes me really nervous."

The eleventh poll was conducted by morning consult between September 19th and 25 with 993 registered voters.
It's very possible.
So it's nothing crazy anyways.
"Uh, this is kind of like their daily polling trend, uh, T I P P the right now they do have Trump sitting plus two."
"Well, they need know it's said all the ti years."
You know why?
So far the Harris campaign has said no and the market agrees that she won't show up pricing in a 37% chance of it happening before October.
So in Wisconsin 52% say Trump better on immigration 45% say Harris preserving democracy in the United States.
"And then as I got older, I continued to benefit from people who reinforced those values."
Well the DNC didn't give us enough support.
I'm a data geek.

I think that creating that sense of a community amongst voters to get them engaged and get them out to the polls is going to be super important.
Previously it appeared that the race post debate had frozen in place with neither candidate with any clear momentum.
Will they have to spend more money there?
In the video that has been circulating the media which made people consider that he was staged was when they were trying to get him off of the stage and he threw a fist at the crowd and people believed that he was staged because he was literally telling them to calm down and let him make the fist to the crowd.
But the Harris campaign cannot get overconfident.
He was supposed to win the state.
People love him.
What made you want to come out here and sell merch to the people and interact with the people and support Donald J. Trump?
"But I do think in the end that if we keep working and we keep, there's still a lot of voters still up for grabs."
But it was a statement that is much more painful to get because they're oftentimes in very bad shape.
"I mean, to catch everybody up on who Carrie Lake is, just over a decade ago, she donated to Barack Obama."

"Which is the whole point of what's going on here because as politically, a political analyst would say, it is the undecided people who will decide the direction Pennsylvania goes."
He was great.
There are no county officials around.
And the candidates need to fight over what they're going to do in the next four years.
"Of course, Donald Trump and I believe there were problems in 2020."
Is there any evidence that suggests that he in fact was trying to do that?
But also it leaves people like me scratching our heads.
The surprise of a lifetime for a mother there as Donald Trump gives a hundred dollar bill at the checkout line to a mother of three there in Pennsylvania.
"And also on top of that with the voter registration with all the recent polls where Trump's outperforming his numbers in 2020 and 2016 and he won in 2016 and he barely lost in 2020, Pennsylvania is looking really good that you can see the data with Biden winning the state by 81 K. This is huge news for Trump's election chances because it means democratic mail and enthusiasm is falling off and not just by more than Republicans and raw numbers, but at twice the rate 2020 was a pandemic year."
They're a threat to democracy.
She will not ban fracking.
He leads by five points over Joe Biden and that's with RFK Jr claiming he has enough signatures to get on the ballot in Michigan.

They're going to have to sign up for that early ballot list every time from now on rather than just having their ballots sent to their home.
So I'm glad you raised that point because I wanna play a clip from this morning where our colleague Jake Tapper asked speaker Mike Johnson for his reactions on some of those Trump remarks.
And that four-point swing actually is translated to a bit more than what we've seen just across the national map.
Pennsylvania's voters can't seem to decide.
The best people.
Hamas conducts the attack against Israel.

"Again, you have folks who very much do support the vice president."
"Jill Stein is getting 1% in Pennsylvania, 2% in Michigan and 1% in Wisconsin."
"If Joe Biden was leading the polls in every single swing state, some swing states that, you know, Democrats didn't even win last time, and he was up by, let's say, five points in some of them, there's no universe that Trump would even be a 20% favorite, yet they make Biden the outright favorite even if it is by a narrow margin."

"And if you're uncomfortable with it, you can still show up on election day and cast a provisional ballot."
So there's two questions here.
It's been exciting.
"Rasmussen, I can't see."
I don't think it's indicative necessarily of his actions in terms of Fanny.
"The way that they raise it, the fact that they did the audit is what helped foment these questions and people."
And don't forget to click the red subscribe button below to get more of News Nation's fact-driven unbiased coverage.
"However in their poll just after the debate they got the same result, showing no gains for either candidate."
And that I think is the question mark.
"Well, again, look, all of that underscores the importance of the work that you guys are doing over at the bulwark because having, you know, these, these former Republicans and independents speaking to Republican voters out there, disaffected Republicans, independents gives them a permission structure to know that it is okay just because they voted for Republicans in the past, that there is a community."
The article does mention that they recently brought in Paulette Aniskoff.
"And then in addition to that, you also have some rulings that impact how ballots will be addressed and how election night will be handled here in Georgia."
"Sean Parnell, you now have a new quarterback for your Pittsburgh Steelers."
I was former president Obama wrapping up we're at times what we're at times passionate emotional remarks in Pittsburgh the first stop on his sprint through swing stage four Kamala Harris
He's pointing out her flip flop and even warning during the last debate that fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one if she's elected.
We are going to be number one this year.
They've been treated unbelievably badly.
"Well Trump had a Pennsylvania rally yesterday and he held up the, not held up, but he had the girl that came out that prepared his big chart that he says saved his life and it was a rip roaring rally and he let come on, there is habit."
"Because Philly is make or break for Democrats in Pennsylvania, right?"
"Maybe we should, I don't know, bring back a little bit more YMCA."
"There's one big survey out Sunday, it's suggested Harris got no notable convention polling bounce, which I don't think is a complete surprise because, you know, once she shifted to the top of the ticket, there was this ground swell of enthusiasm, which, you know, one could say that would have been what happened after perhaps the DNC, instead she got it before."
Democrats have a small lead and a lot of that is male.
He had trans kids on his show in 2010.
"Okay, for those of you just joining in Butler, Pennsylvania at a rally of about 50,000 patriotic Trump loving Americans gathered together on a Saturday to hear about the president's agenda."
"And it's at least conceivable to me that in setting policy, you wouldn't want to say, hey, maybe there's some secret negotiation that's happening at the same time or something like that."
"In contrast to what he considers to be the failure of the Republican Party to protect basic freedoms in their current form, he highlighted marriage equality, religious freedom, and union rights and public safety as areas in which Democrats have been defending fundamental liberties."
"I mean, that's how we pay for it."
"I'm just giving a deep dime and noticing some broadly, I would say Concerning very concerning for Kamala Harris."
A little bit different than what we heard from him in 2020.
And I think this is really smart on her behalf.
"You know, one final thing on this, it's not related to the native issue in particular, but one of the things that I think really separates Donald Trump's approach to leadership and Kamala Harris's approach to leadership is Donald Trump believes in persuading your fellow citizens and not trying to censor them."
"But again, that's not too much to worry for the Republican Party."
CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes is following both campaigns for us from Washington.
Key swing state for both parties.
The campaign in the coming months is expected to continue intensifying with more resources and time invested in this state.
"Earlier in an interview, Trump discussed his concerns about the upcoming election day and his potential second term from dismissed Biden's awareness and emphasized that the real threat comes from within the country."
"Pennsylvania, the decisive battleground state, is where both leading candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, are intensifying their campaigns with different strategies and policies."
"And it's that shift that is in some ways historic, but also potentially unique to this specific contest."
"We're tired of the show, we're sick of the con."
You know who a dictator is?
"Now, when they add insider advantage and eventually get rid of this New York Times poll, it's probably going to be like Trump plus one."
"Though in reality, Joe Biden performed worse than Clinton did when she lost Florida back in 2016."
"In the last 50, 60 years, and now that Kissinger is dead, he's the worst, this is saying that it was equating with Darth Vader."
Polymarket founded in 2020 has been enjoying a breakout year amid enthusiasm for election betting monthly volume more than tripled from June to $387 million in July according to Dune Analytics.
"I think poll after poll that shows the presidential race effectively, you know, a dead heat, shows Senator Casey with a little bit of a lead."
I think it is safe to say that MSNBC is not reporting with the same level of integrity as Newsmax.
Two people familiar with this said that she has expressed fresh concerns about security following two assassination attempts against Trump.
"For example, she's also unveiling policies that providing a million loans for black entrepreneurs, national health initiative that is intended to focus on diseases that particularly impact black people."
And he's running well ahead of Kerry Lake.
And Watkins says he believes Shapiro is the kind of candidate that could pull Pennsylvania in favor of Harris.
"If we have this sort of equivalent of Kobe Bryant or Steph Curry or LeBron or something like that, they want to join the team."
He did vigorous campaign.
"If Republicans win either Michigan or Pennsylvania, then the night's over."
That's another thing that's factored into Dr. Oz.
"It says Harris courts Polish American votes in Pennsylvania Polish Americans are an important if politically overlooked demographic, but in Pennsylvania many have tended to lean Republican So keep in mind Pennsylvania is a dog fight."
"He said, would the war be over if you were president of the United States?"
If Harris wins Pennsylvania more than likely she wins the presidency.
"It was it was Donald Trump, obviously, back then by point seven percent."
I was born with President Obama wrapping up.
That's a better deficit for Harris than it was with Joe Biden on the issue of the economy.
She's in office.
She said that Carrie Lake is an extreme candidate.
"Trump's narrow victory in the state in 2016, followed by his loss to Biden in 2020, highlights the state's importance in determining the outcome of presidential elections."
"And if rounding up and deporting millions of desperate people, many of them women and children, is the answer to everything?"
I'm criticizing the editing choice they made in this case because I do think the response in the unedited version was something people should hear about.
"And at that meeting, did Mr. Giuliani raise any specific allegations of election fraud again?"
We would expect Bernie Moreno to win by around two to three points.
"Biden's approval ratings remain relatively high, and his endorsement carries significant weight, often swaying undecided voters and solidifying the party's stance."
She went away.
"All right, Jake Rosen reporting for us from Washington."
"So with each passing day just like North Carolina, it's trending Republican."
"And it belongs to you, Christina."
"I mean, it's just the facts, you know, so are you a Marine?"
"If Trump can win Pennsylvania by two or three points, I think it is possible."
We pray for you.
That's a big one.
"Because as I have been saying for months now, Donald Trump was never hitting 50% in battleground state polls."
"But I think that there are, for a lot of people, they say, well, they said all this in 2016 about him, how he's going to be dangerous and all that kind of stuff."
"If you get Arizona, if you get Pennsylvania, wait, actually, I think you might need, you might need another state after that."
"And if Carrie Lake is able to get those folks out in the rural part of state, who hadn't voted before until Donald Trump came along, but also win over so many folks like herself, who one time consider themselves moderates or even liberals or moderate Republicans to come over and embrace her here in the Maricopa County suburb areas, you're looking at a Governor Carrie Lake in 2023."
So let's steal from The New York Times right here.
"Well, look, we're going to be out crisscrossing Pennsylvania."
And you can see that.
"We don't really have a problem in the voting process in this country, nor do you have a problem in this state or Michigan or Pennsylvania or Georgia, anywhere else."
That's over 60 years ago.
It shuts off so many of Trump's paths to victory.
She gets asked a tough question.
"So when you look at the numbers, is it advantage Democrats in your state?"
He has a real plan to make this country competitive again in terms of business.
But the truth is that people are feeling the pinch.
And our electoral college system means there are only about six states that matter and the polls are showing very tight races in all of those states.
"Go back to 2016, 2020, 2004."
The Democratic Party in Arizona filed a lawsuit yesterday to try to stop this from going forward in Arizona.
And so this is really unfortunate.
So give us a sense of you know what are they counting now and you know people may wonder why we're sort of holding off on coming to a conclusion.
And they go after Supreme Court justices.
And we make more money.
Your reaction.
And we just saw the two candidates for Senate there face off Senator Bob Casey and businessman Dave McCormick had a spirited debate tonight in Pennsylvania is also where Donald Trump and Kamala Harris spent much of the day on Monday.
Trump's message appears to be resonating with suburban voters in particular.
"Yeah, and there's a reason why President Biden is traveling to the state three times in one week."
He's my friend.
I'm not sure that Harris has that kind of instincts or experience to know where that is.
And so I just want you to be aware of that when you go and cast your vote.
They tend to move together.
"Now let me say this, I'm not saying that she can't win this election."
"If I'm a black voter watching that, I'm more likely to vote for Trump."
"Historically, this state has often determined the winner of presidential elections."
It's going to go back down at ebbs and flows.
And that's the sad part.
Both candidates have bet big on Pennsylvania.
"So in addition to sort of becoming more aggressive in her messaging about the former president, you see her doing media interviews all over the place."
And the politicians are following.
We also know she ran against Madeline Dean a Democratic member of Congress in suburban Philadelphia lost by 30 which that's what you're going to do in 2018 against was was it 2018 or 2020.
"You know, love that."
"And so normally that's not a big deal, but because this election was always going to be close, it actually has outsized impact."
They're going to change the name of Pennsylvania.
"This time, Congress will have the full weight of the federal government behind its security, including more officers on the ground and technology to detect potential material used in weapons of mass destruction."
"I mean, the ultimate measure of leadership is the tenacity with which you pursue peace."
"By that means she was really the only reporter, as far as we know, who was able to get herself inside the room."
"When Fox News mentioned the findings, Trump responded, and we put this up on screen, Fox News and other media outlets incorrectly side with the outdated and terrible Maricopa County Election Board to report no fraud found in the presidential election."
"And a reporter asked Paul, have you ever been called?"
"However, Trump has maintained strong support in more rural parts of the state, particularly in the central and western regions, which are predominantly white and working class."
Russell has donated a staggering $15 million to Kamala Harris' campaign.
"Thank you, Joe Manchin."
"But for some reason, I think things are heating up and they don't like our poll numbers being out there."
And this is par for the course for Alina Habba and Trump surrogates.
And Ace.
"The letter calls for states to decertify electors where elections were certified inaccurately and suggests the US House of Representatives quote, convene and vote per the US Constitution by means of one vote per state to decide the rightful winner of the election."
If Trump is somehow able to even raise the margins further in Metro Pittsburgh that will offset some of his expected losses in Philadelphia collar.
"But remember, this was the same polling drop with Quinnipiac where they had Trump up by four in Michigan, the same polling drop up for in Michigan and winning Wisconsin by two as well, by the way."
They're about drinking.
The Democrats were less organized here.
"And if you don't like the current administration, well, she's made all the decisions too."
It's 5050.
The results is that what they're just there to support as well?
"And I think that we need to really focus on making sure that he is not elected, of course, because he is a threat to our democracy."
"Democrat incumbent Bob Casey, still in the lead, but that lead has been shrinking in recent polls."
Is there anything else you wanted to mention?
"Ah, Lori Roberts writing this week for the Arizona Republic, quote, anyone waiting breathlessly for Attorney General Mark Burnovich to launch an investigation into the fake Trump electors who participated in a scheme to overturn Arizona's vote should wait no longer."
My name is Marcus.
This is the kind of person who's going to help Kamala get stuff done.
Let's rock Maybe the VP pick could help her solidify some of those swing states But the problem is pennsylvania And I don't know what camel's deficit looks like in pennsylvania right now but uh We're gonna find out very soon Very very soon and I hope they've well we got time before the convention To lock things down to let polls start to gel To raise Gretchen Whitmer's profile to raise JP Pritzker's profile Anybody else who may want to get in the game some people have said Elizabeth Warren again Too old.
The enthusiasm is high on both sides.
But I also certainly understand the feeling that we now have with a new generation stepping forward.
"The Amish can't be pulled in many cases by families will share one phone and these, these are, these are businessmen."
It's one of those counties just north of Philadelphia.
That resonates here.
"But again, I think there's that frustration that something is not coming through to that whatever percentage of Americans just aren't buying it."
"With each region bringing its own set of priorities and concerns to the table, Pennsylvania's strong labor union presence, particularly in the manufacturing sector, has historically leaned democratic."
It's a consistent thing that we are now seeing.
What I get when I go?
I've heard it many different ways at this point.
The reality of the matter is that generally hasn't happened.
"Like it'll, it's going to happen no matter who, like really from the, no matter a Democrat or Republican at this point, like it's going to happen."
"During COVID, we were the only state in the country that never once shut down a single business."
I'm just saying that you can't underestimate the stupidity of the general public and how many NPCs there are in this election.
"But I think one key thing is, as Elaine points down her dispatch from the Arizona rally, you know, the way to achieve legitimacy in the GOP these days is to rally behind Trump's election lies."
She knew when she pulled out earlier.
"When they asked Kamala countless times how she would lower prices in the stores and get inflation under control, she went through this diatribe about how she grew up in a middle class family."
But all the other kind of progressive support both in state and nationally is behind Jamie McLeod Skinner who very well may knock Schrader out.
"But still, Trump's endorsement is doing well."
"And again, we're talking about people in the middle who don't know quite which way they're going."
"And they're not really the strongest pollster, period."
We just need the team in place to start working on that.
"It's about ad dollars, too."
It's much easier to work under a Trump administration than this administration by far.
Others as well addressed so many stuff.
 Part of it.
"So some of these Rasmussen was on one time, was off one time, it was on again, I can't remember the times."
"But it all comes down to Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania is essentially, you know, stuff might happen in North Carolina now, especially because of the hurricane."
You can bet your bottom dollar somebody is there.
"But yeah, it's a lot to process."
"You know, she's shown that she's shrewd and that's that's a that's a valuable asset."
I was calling to let you know that the president's available to take your call for free.
A lot of people in the crowd are not wearing masks.
"Joining us now from Chicago, we've got Patrick Murphy, who's a former US Congressman and the 32nd Undersecretary of the Army."
"We've got a lot more work to do, but things are going well."
"Not only is that cuckoo for Coco Pops, but that's like devolving in a way that is, that's more than I would have expected."
I just think it speaks to some subtle subtly who we think is going to be an effective communicator for people and who isn't that I don't know if it's necessarily true.
Trump will conduct diplomacy.
"This time, as you say, he is still under criminal charges here in Fulton County for that."
Everything we did was according to the law.
"So it's important, but it hasn't really moved at all."
And then I went back to the White House and I started throwing hamburgers at the wall.
"Listen Getting out we would have been out faster than that, but we wouldn't have lost the soldiers We wouldn't have left many Americans behind and we wouldn't have left we wouldn't have left 85 billion dollars worth of brand-new beautiful military equipment behind and just to finish They blew it The agreement said you have to do this this this this this and they didn't do it They didn't do it."
This is just waiting in line though Look at all these people That's wild Mattel y'all this is this is definitely wild and they keep late.
Portrait right there.
"When you hear it, what you hear is he's talking to Pennsylvania voters saying that they don't like Trump style, but they're going to vote for him anyway."
"And so I think Kamala Harris needs to make sure she's continuing to fight these legal matters right now and then obviously being prepared for what happens later, what comes later."
"And that's like the classic area of swing voter there in, you know, this area between Detroit and Ann Arbor."
So to me it's just really hard because it's what they really do when they're elected.
I'm absolutely convinced.
That's what I make.
"You know, we're seeing it, of course, in Arizona when they're, where they're announcing their big results today."
"No, it's every single poll that shifted like that."
And I think more people want elected officials who understand the day to day needs of working class Americans.
And there were many great nerds.
Because I could go into office and print $3 trillion and have the highest stock market in human history.
"But as I mentioned, it's about 44% of the Democratic electorate."
We're about to board the plane to California.
"So with election rallies in the last phase, Donald Trump has proposed ending US income taxes for Americans who live abroad as part of his 2024 presidential campaign."
"And also this morning, the House Select Committee investigating the January 6th insurrection has issued its first subpoenas for documents and testimony for four of Trump's closest advisers."
"I don't know so much about shooting other than I'm very good for the Second Amendment, I can tell you, but I don't know so much about shooting."
We shouldn't let anybody walk through into our country.
It's probably a pretty good encapsulation of America.
Because say what you want about Donald Trump.
It's not some lighthearted thing.
"Thousands of people braved the sweltering summer heat, waiting for hours under the blazing sun to attend the highly anticipated rally."
"And if you listen to his lies, it's like listening to Santa Claus."
"According to O'Neill's U.S., one out of every five Hispanics will vote in their first presidential election this year."
It's shameful.
They said they want to secure the border.
And it has gotten redder.
Now they have Donald Trump leading by three points and we got a poll from the New York Times that shows the opposite.
It's not really a thing.
Polling isn't everything.
"Obama completely trashed him on that, which was funny at the time, by the way."
This is Scranton.
"So, Dylan, what does that suggest to you?"
I care about our kids' education.
You're going to see people move out of the areas where the drilling and gas is.
"Masriano, he was really, really out there."
"According to a search warrant, officers seized the ninth grade student's phone in August at an East Onical Township home."
Haircuts coming back in style.
Section 5 â€“ The People's Concerns Attendees at the rally expressed a range of concerns heading into the 2024 election.
It's fake news.
"If she can successfully navigate the challenges ahead, she has a real chance of making history as the nation's first female president, breaking barriers and setting new precedents."
"I told my buddy, he said, I'll never vote for Donald Trump."
"Barack Marmo, CEO of Deep Well Services bluntly said, quote, I don't believe anybody in the Biden administration."
The report also found only four of the cases have led the charges so far.
And I think that's the best definition of freedom.
"Hi, Senator Vance, Rachel Louise Joes with ABC 15 Arizona."
"Thank you very much for joining us Oh, hey, it's just great to be here."
"You know, we have said all along that this decision was a deeply personal decision that Vice President Harris was going to have to make."
"And today, we got to talk about CNN interviewing and profiling a group of people in Pennsylvania who are kind of moderate, maybe center leftist, maybe center, right."
"She went from 44.3% today to now three points higher and 47.6%, in fact, 3.3% higher."
I see what kind of stuff you're on Nikki Haley.
"A couple of weeks ago, we had Ana Navarro visit us on the bus tour talking about reproductive rights."
We get laughed at a lot for some of the shenanigans that our government does.
The former president has been moved off-site.
Then Donald Trump tells Kristi Noem who killed her dogs that you know a lot about guns.
"And so I don't know how they came up with that number, but I don't have any faith in that."
"No, and that's the majority of the country because the majority of the country, they don't live in those upscale suburbs."
She's focusing on these northern battleground states to try to put up a fight against former president Donald Trump.
"Well, the first thing I think she has to do is be herself."
President Trump wants to give a boost to another primary candidate.
"Well, I find it interesting."
Oh my gosh I'm so excited.
Just shit.
"I've been saying that since the kindergarten, during the middle of our convention, that there wasn't this great surge in enthusiasm."
She's going to be tied to the Biden record regardless of what she says or what she does.
"In the interview with Fox News, Jackson said that his nephew was grazed in the neck by the bullet and it cut his neck and he was bleeding."
 It's the top of the hour.
You know interesting attempt by Democrats to kind of break break their mold.
"So even in the extreme circumstances where race is Democrat plus 15, the Republican poll will show Democrats plus five."
He's a teacher.
We did nothing.
" The House Select Committee, investigating the January 6th insurrection, has accused Donald Trump of playing a direct and personal role in pressuring state and local officials to help overturn Joe Biden's 2020 election victory."
Look at this guy.
But the only reason it's not like a Trump plus one lead is because of the Suffolk poll for those that don't know Suffolk University is one of the worst pollsters out there.
"He was out there camp on the road with a right wing activist, Laurel Lumer, and sort of trying to announce new policy initiatives, like something like No Taxes on Overtime, really leaning into blue collar voters."
So we've hired private investigators.
I just felt her Passion response and that she would carry it out and that resonated with you in the moment.
"But you know, in terms of these big states, the big seven, we're talking about Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and then Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada."
Did you ever hear that expression before?

I was about to say I saw I saw the EGA there.
"His family remembers him as a warm and emotionally connected father and grandfather, who enjoyed life to the fullest, and they plan to honor his memory with a celebration of life event."

Think about this.
"In fact, let me just weigh in on something."

"So Kamala Harris, when she's here in Michigan, she's really hammering home the fact that it was the Biden-Harris administration that passed this massive inflation reduction act, which contains billions of dollars worth of grants and subsidies and credits and incentives for green energy and especially important here in Michigan for green vehicles, incentives to buy them, but more importantly here in Michigan, incentives to build them, incentives to convert factories into electric vehicle factories."
The lap dog definitely was a memorable one.
"We then also have Delaware and New Jersey, which are probably blue as well."
"It's like, really?"
I Liked how she spoke from her heart.
What would that mean?
"You know, some of those counties might still move left, but it's possible they could even shift right because you have other demographics besides, you know, college-educated white voters that are going to be moving to the right more so than college-educated white voters can move to the left at this point."
While Trump was on stage at a rally in Pennsylvania a sniper from some distance attempted to assassinate him.
We've got a rally coming up with Doug Bastiano and that's going to be with the Amish in the midnight.
Brian Kemp most certainly gained his reelection as governor by a margin.
"And this is what you hear on the campaign trail of, look, here are these tax credits, here's this tax relief that's going to come to you."

"But yet, the very public wasn't necessarily familiar with her."
"It's crazy Here's another angle This is a while That's crazy Look is Hey, at least the sheriff's department got it cuz I don't know where to uh, Okay, I'll see your service here a little late though That's wild y'all that's why I Like I said, this is my first time seeing this I didn't even know you know this Happened but this is definitely it's definitely crazy."
It's Bob Casey who's doing right by Pennsylvania I'm Bob Casey and I definitely approve this message so a surprising I could say a surprising advertisement because he is running on Trump's tariffs and and Buying and trying to restrict natural gas and oil which again tariffs are popular in Pennsylvania trying to ban fracking or restrict natural oil and gas That's not popular.
"He said that they did have proof, and I asked him, do you have names?"

"It's a state that's a little bit tougher for Donald Trump, even though he won it very narrowly in 2016, has a lot of voters, a lot of Republican voters that are tough for him in the WOW counties around Milwaukee, the suburban sort of well-educated voters."
But we have this dead heat.
"She's got momentum now, but this race still has a long way to go."
We're talking.
"All right, Erin."
That doesn't bother you.
When did that become OK?
"And by the way, I'm sorry, gentlemen."
I've got to ask you quickly about some changes Three charges against Trump dropped yesterday.
Are you confident in the Arizona election system and are you going to accept the results moving forward?
Do you really believe Michigan's going to vote Republican?
"So really, as you get older, it seems as you tend to get more conservative."
That's the reports.
"Now, nuclear politics hasn't added in either of these polls, which I find to be interesting, but I've been very adamant with you guys from the very beginning."

Harris 51 in Pennsylvania to Trump's 45.
Helping director David Sherman retell them the rocket is the story is Jean Renoux.
"Look at 2024 Republicans went down by roughly 50,000 votes."
What approach do you think would be the best path forward for her right now?
"And I get it, it sort of does a bit of a self-service, but when some of these polls actually do get released publicly and the Republican pollsters are sponsoring them, they never want to come back to their base and their core donors and say, we're losing our own poll by a massive amount."
"Okay, that smile on her Yes, this okay."
What would a Harris point five victory look like?
I haven't asked a question yet.
"Within literally within hours, they're sold out."
"Yeah, there's no question."
That means there are a lot of American families who are not getting the things that they need.
"I mean, I know they can mention fracking."
"Vice President Harris has been replaying some of former President Trump's words that he's used at his rallies and in certain interviews that indicate that he would use the military, for example, to go after his political opponents or leftists."

"Obviously, what's so shocking about that?"
"But but then the Long Island rally, maybe it's to help House Republicans."
But let me pull this up with that caveat from Quinnipiac October 3rd to 7th.
So there are no people with guns that are out on display.
"He just discovered a stone carved with 1775 M, likely the initial of gang leader Moses Doan."
What does it say about the state of this race that this is the tack that he's taking now?
Is Kamala Harris going to be the next president of the United States of America?
And I will always have the fact of America's steel workers.
I know that name.
My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency.
"Oh, right."
They've been giving us the Green New Deal.
"We know that President Biden is expected to also campaign in Florida for former governor, Charlie Crist, now campaigning for his old job, but in a different party."
Are you with us or are you against us?
"That's what we do over here on this channel So uh, subscribe hit the comments and i'll catch you guys on the next one."
"Scott, can you tell us what is happening now?"
"Former President Trump begins by calling you a Rhino, a Republican in name only."
Those people are more dangerous.
"And so you know that I haven't thought that Trump had an age problem because I'm like, look, if you think the things he's saying is crazy, he's always been crazy, right?"
"So for Trump right now, and then obviously you look at all the betting and everything like that and in the Atlas Intel poll, and now we're really talking about the popular vote being a potential Trump victory as well to the point where I might have to predict a Trump popular vote victory."
She's changing the momentum and she's building out a broader coalition in a way that Democrats had not been able to be able to do under Joe Biden.
And that quest continues.
You're going to have lines that are not going to be as long in 2020.
And also by saying they kept repeating this whole bullseye thing that Joe Biden said.
"Again, I'm not denying that she is doing better than Biden because well, Biden was just doing so bad that people were begging for something else."
"So many veterans are upset about that, including here in Pennsylvania."
Thank you so much for your support.
"What I will ask you about, my friend, your takeaways from this conversation, what stands out most?"
"Yeah, that case has been embroiled in a lot of controversy with district attorney Fonnie Willis And questions about whether she will even remain on the case as she had a relationship alleged relationship with the prosecutor on the case as well So a few charges dropped on that Trump not commenting on it at this moment He did not mention it yesterday at all, but he does talk often about how his court cases are Quote rigged against him and he believes he will defeat them all so allies I spoke to yesterday on the Trump campaign just kind of shrugged it off and said look it's just part of Kind of what we've been dealing with with these court cases They said that they are confident that Trump will beat all of them and you know We'll be looking to see if any of these court cases really come to fruition and come on the docket before November time is really ticking out especially for Jack Smith in Washington DC, right?"
I can't really say that because I don't really know.
Charges are being dropped.
Who else here immediately came to the comments to see him?
We don't call each other names.
"So at this point in the race, I don't think you can look to the polls reliably to say who is going to win."
He's not talking about God is on the side of Republicans.
The final Pennsylvania Senate debate between Democrat Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick happens live tonight on 6 ABC.
They've been called fickle because they're not a reliable age group to actually show up to the polls.
"I do think Nevada has probably got a higher chance than Arizona, but even Arizona, I would say around a 60% chance Trump wins it."
"Alex, you know, you're doing such an excellent job of breaking down these two states for us."
"And look, even though your grocery prices are improving, gas is going down slowly."
"The variation in polling data across different areas reflects the state's diverse political landscape, with each region bringing its own set of priorities and concerns to the table."
"Again, God bless him and his family."
They've done things that nobody thought was even possible.
"In terms of my immediate plan, I will tell you a few of the following."
See you next time.
Brave.
Where you already had a lot of Democrats switched to voting in person.
And these visits come as Vice President Kamala Harris visited Erie PA last night while former President Donald Trump spoke to a crowd of local supporters in Oaks.
"Yeah, stop the count."
"But they're bringing in like, oh, we're going to have a battery assembly plant, all the parts from China, of course."
" Overview of polling data in key states, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada.as the political landscape heats up in the lead up to the upcoming elections, polling data from critical battleground states provides insight into voter preferences and potential outcomes."
I'm probably wrong.
"As the Democratic National Convention approaches, Harris's upcoming speech is anticipated to further boost her campaign, setting the stage for a crucial period leading up to the presidential debate and the start of early voting."
"According to a poll conducted by Emerson College between October 5th and 8th, involving 900 likely voters, Kamala Harris holds a lead with 49 percent compared to Donald Trump's 48 percent."
"The more inflationary debt cycle, economic calamity with food shortages, rationing, limits on your transportation, vehicle limits, the more you're going to have calamity, the easier it is to impose this kind of centrally planned totalitarian vision."
"And he was this big horrible person who killed, I mean, they said he killed millions."
"So, Dan, tell us, voters, they're not moved by yesterday's verdict."
So the economy is going to continue to get better.
We have all these epic designs.
Will you do that for me?
"Yeah, and we're going to have tons of little data points like this during the next seven months."
I'll put it right here.
"So when people are saying, oh, well, we've got these folks without documents, they're automatically, no, no, no."
And that's against the backdrop of a bunch of races to be the top elections official that we've covered that have now partisan Republican candidates running basically in the mode of the big lie.
"That's a pretty compelling stat, especially when you look at how our economy are unemployment into the historic low right now in America."
We will not yield.
Here's Governor Walz again.
"And meanwhile, the Trump force 47 is launching in Arizona with the grand opening of a new office in Phoenix."
"So Trump knows that if he wins here, he's on a really good path to maybe winning."
"The event is being held in Palm Beach at a billionaire's house, so that rules out Mar-a-Lago."
"So you can't, you know, dissect one poll."
"I mean, you've got Mayor Parker in Philadelphia."
Take care.
"And listen, these are just, you know, these are just the polls."
Pennsylvania also includes many rural areas and traditional industrial zones where voters lean towards the Republican Party and Donald Trump.
So we'll see how that gets resolved in the next coming eight days.
It don't matter.
She's going to New Hampshire on Wednesday.
"His experience in the classroom and his service to the country have shaped his leadership style, which emphasizes pragmatism and a commitment to working families."
Peace
"But then we have this other issue set that only limits the choices to abortion rights, illegal immigration, rising prices and protecting our democracy and protecting our democracy is like a dog whistle."
"She was actually at 1.6 on the 12th, which is damn near a month ago at this point."
I wish there were more diverse candidates.
And in fact it stayed that way and voted blue for every single presidential election all the way through the Bush years.
It resulted eventually in him dropping out of the race less than a month later.
"By highlighting the court's decision as evidence of their commitment to preventing fraud, Trump's campaign can continue to push the narrative that the 2020 election was flawed and that they are actively working to address these issues."
"And in some ways, this is a race about who do you like less incumbent politicians or hedge fund managers, right?"
"Anthony, you're speaking my language as someone who grew up in Bucks County, Pennsylvania."
"You have Erie, you have Pittsburgh, you have Harrisburg, you have you have you have Philadelphia, you have Scranton."
They did not win for Donald Trump.
"Early voting dominance suggests she's on the right track, but the race is far from over."
"The gap has narrowed, which is a positive for her."
"Welcome to The Morning Agenda, WITF's daily news podcast, where the only agenda is you."
I cannot comprehend that.
Pennsylvania's cannot trust Kamala Harris or Bob Casey on the most critical industry for their future.
"His message of economic populism, combined with his stance on issues like immigration and trade, resonated strongly with these voters in 2016."
And he couldn't even do that right.
"You know, when you win, you don't really necessarily have to do it a second time."
"And when we flipped Arizona red to blue, that meant that Trump was hit under the water line, right?"
"They're really banking on the idea that, well, these far right pollsters like Insider Advantage, Emerson, Trafalgar, they're going to understate Harris."
I'm not a Democrat.
"At another table we found Corey Stevens, a Republican who ran for county supervisor that seemed to acknowledge some things her party's candidate says."
"He wants you to believe that if you let him round up whoever he wants and ship him out, all your problems will be solved."
"All the efforts you made to prepare for an election during a pandemic, all the things you put in place, did that actually make it easier to go through those nine?"
"Anthony Salvanto, as always, thank you for bringing this to us."
Make no mistake.
"Um, You know, I don't trust the media and what they say, you know My mom is a very educated woman and you know, she she believes in Trump and I believe in my mom So, you know, I'm here to support her, but I don't always trust what the media says So I'd rather hear it from the horse's mouth I want to ask you're obviously a female person of color that's some of the Democrats core constituency What would you say to possibly reach out to Democrats?"
And you are the type of person we want to be the president.
And so both of these states will remain under Trump.
"So heck, if there were kids out here, I could put them to work."
Ford just announced they're bailing.
"I understand you don't speak for this group, but what does that mean?"
"Pivot to, yeah."
Take a look at what they say.
Now here are some of the names being considered Governor Shapiro Arizona Senator Mark Kelly Minnesota Governor Tim Waltz Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg Kentucky Governor Andy Bashir and Illinois Governor J.
He's going to be appearing on his own because he's still a big draw within the Democratic Party.
Integrity.
That's like I broke some type of taboo.
Democrats back Harris 95 to 4 percent.
They are now separated here by less than a point.
She got old.
On that point the press secretary had no comment.
"Set between the events of the first and second Aliens, the seventh installment in the Alien franchise takes us back to space where no one can hear you scream."
"We started driving, as we mentioned, in Brooklyn."
"It's like Trump says, hey, I want to get a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia."
So we are basically doing a lot of the Democrat activities just to elect Republicans.
"They have all, has your town changed slightly?"
That is bull crap.
That's what strength looks like.
 19 electoral votes at stake in the Keystone State.
Can you get me tickets?
"If you look at the battleground states, Pennsylvania offers the most electoral votes out of all of them."
But now Donald Trump leads in Pennsylvania.
"Then over in Wisconsin, out of the core swing states this cycle, Biden's numbers were surprisingly the strongest here before he dropped out."
"Because if Kamala can't win Pennsylvania, she's not winning."
"And to help stave off a shortage of blood at the height of summer heat and travel, the American Red Cross is imploring people to donate."
Are you feeling optimistic about things at the moment?
"Yeah, I think it'd be great to have him back and have the vice president there."
"He said a lot of weird stuff, too, so I'm just going to say that."
"But most importantly, let people know why you want Donald J. Trump to be the next president of the United States of America."
Harris plus four.
"They're already at 330,000 while Democrats they're still 200,000 votes shy from their total in 2022."
"And of course that in and of itself is a misrepresentation, because a lot of those people, number one, you had hospitals that were incentivized to label every death as a COVID death due to insurance."
"In my race, I think Kamala Harris is about close to that."
Don't worry.
And I'm really optimistic.
And it's not necessarily in such a vital state.
" According to the latest Noble Predictive Insights poll, Donald Trump holds a three-point lead over Kamala Harris in Arizona, 47 to 44 percent."
"And did he ever, did you ever receive from him that evidence either during the call, after the call, or to this day?"
"Right now, polling there shows that Vice President Kamala Harris leads among young voters."
So you hear John talk about there being a bigger loser.
She lost.
her ineptitude and her Incompetence and her Her war on the Second Amendment.
So she's been in Pennsylvania for a couple of years at least.
Here they are with our ballots.
That's not going to happen and we know it but Kamala Harris does have a Pennsylvania problem and we can discuss it and we're going to discuss it at length in this video.
And I looked up the next day.
"If Donald Trump wins Pennsylvania, he will most likely be president."
He will score two to three points to win it.
I'm expecting hopefully answers.
Kamala Harris received 52% of the vote and Donald Trump 47%.
"Meanwhile, Trump's ability to energize rural voters and maintain his working-class base will be key to his campaign's success.Michigan's population is diverse and politically segmented in ways that make it difficult for either party to establish dominance."
I live there.
Played at my grandpa's funeral.
"Be well, enjoy the rest of this Tuesday and we'll talk again tomorrow."
That's a fact.
Trump's base is highly motivated by issues related to election integrity.
We'll do Madison Square Garden.
Why is it taking so long?
It's going to take a lot more than just one person to turn things around.
"Hey, Donald Trump is your president."
"On behalf of the 16,000 men and women represented by the National Board of Patrol Council, we strongly support and endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States."
It blew the roof off the stadium where the rays play.
I can show you a temper tantrum.
"Yeah, we know that over the last four years, about 10 to 15,000 Haitian immigrants have moved to this town in Springfield, Ohio."
"Specifically, which demographic groups will show up in higher numbers on election day?"
"For this Suffolk poll here, they're literally rated number one."
"Puerto Rico, Pedro Albezo Campos."
"No, that's no warning sign to these people even though I think that's a much larger warning sign, especially as these protests are kind of ramping up because this conflict in the Middle East is showing no signs of stopping."
Every president has to cut their own path.
All that I ask is that you understand that I'm a human being.
That we're going to take other countries jobs.
"During his appearance, Trump continued to say that her selection as vice president has no impact on the election."
What more can you tell us about this one?
"In stark contrast, Donald Trump's campaign succeeded in securing around 20,000 more votes in this key area compared to Clinton, signaling a shift in voter sentiment that Harris must address."
The issue here is that this audit had no grounds to begin with.
Rural and exurban areas.
No matter how many lawsuits or court cases when something is proven.
"But again, a lot of doom."
I also wanted to take a moment out and read the statement that Trump made on Twitter.
"But to see Harris basically, I'm not going to take the bait."
So maybe I think four.
And the outcome will shape the future of America for years to come.
"But if Shapiro is on the ticket, what do you think this means nationally?"
So you went around the country selling all this stuff for Trump and you didn't vote in the previous elections for him?
But just be fair for the most part.
"When she unveiled her running mate, she went to Philly."
That was their final poll.
"And that's why you see those folks, those Kerry Lake type voters come in and turn in their ballots in person here."
And you've been making candidate cookies since 2008.
The Keystone State's energy workers are perfectly justified in mistrusting Camilla Harris.
Perhaps the most dramatic development in Pennsylvania is Harris's surge in suburban areas.
"And Axios kind of summing up the polling trends of recent, Axios put it this way this morning, which I loved kind of speaking to all American voters."
"If it's a cheap stunt, then you got a picture of Kamala literally flipping burgers."
"Either way, it's a popular issue to be discussing in Nevada, which again has so many people in the service industry."
"So really, really good news for the Kamala Harris campaign."
There's actually still a bit of undecidedness among leading Republicans.
All right everybody saw the Trump rally where he was potentially you know tried to be taken and one or two things could be true.
"A lot of fun here, everybody."
I'm super proud to cast my first ever ballot for President Trump.
"And this crowd, it looks like it's going to continue out here growing right now."
"But it's clear that this is actually one way I think that Donald Trump has really shifted the entire, what's considered normal in American politics, is this kind of economic populism or nationalism is in now, and both parties are trying to get in on it."
"Not perfect, but quite accurate in a way that many other national pollsters have really missed the mark."
"It's just a delicious way, I think, to get the stress off the election and all the political ads."
"And I would imagine Baier is going to have a hard time asking questions that haven't already been answered in the public, especially about immigration and then Johnson and Trump killing that border bill."
They're sucking up to their base to try to give them the things that they want.
We saw it in the focus groups afterwards.
"With 126 electoral votes, Trump leads now."
"Yeah, I mean, she didn't really answer the question."
There will be more connection to the Board of Supervisors.
"I can't tell, which is the bigger problem?"
"We're bringing our political panel, Nancy Cook and Sabrina Rodriguez."
Let me be very clear.
He's going to drop out.
And so Kamala Harris now narrowing down even pre-VP selection in Pennsylvania goes to show that Democrats are in a far better position.
I definitely love it.
"She says, I'm not going to ban fracking."
"Yes, exactly."
"But today in Georgia, the Trump campaign, definitely hoping he stays on message trying to court those suburban women voters."
"The upcoming debates will provide her with a valuable opportunity to draw a contrast between her approach and that of her opponents, showcasing her leadership qualities."
"All right, guys, thanks so much."
It's looking good for him.
I saw it in Philadelphia when she and Governor Walz fired up that crowd in Philly.
"No, it's been longer than that Hasn't it?"
"And Perry, it used to be that the opposing party would see the spotlight during the others' convention."
It's called demographics Y'all see that iceberg?
"That's why Pennsylvania, in my opinion, is the must win state of the cycle."
So here they are.
"Use the built-in stand to display him proudly on your desk, or just keep him under your bed."
It causes damage to the brain.
"Like, for example, for the national polls, if you do like F of P equals 46 because that's what I think he's going to get."
I'm read Cowan.
"Remember, it was only two weeks ago that President Biden exited the race and that the party rallied behind Harris to replace him at the top of the ticket."
Some of their they said some about them cheering on the The people they do it is they're not cheering on the people that's doing this.
"God bless you, my friend."
Because I'm a business owner.
"At the moment, a 15-week abortion ban is in effect in Arizona, but a proposal is on the ballot this year that will give voters a chance to restore reproductive rights in this state."
Kamala Harris will triumph by rather less than 15.
We have a big crowd.
So it used to be the case that social security was supposed to be enough to help you live without needing other forms of income.
"And while that battle happens on screen, CBS News has reporting on another battle taking place behind the screen, the scenes off screen, you might say, also in the Keystone State."
" The countdown is on 15 days till the midterm elections and candidates in one of the most closely watched races will face off tomorrow, exactly two weeks until the election."
"There's not much that the Trump campaign is offering you if you are somebody who just wants to keep jobs in America, right?"
"Tell me among suburban Republicans, among centrists, to make sure that if there is any unexpected low turnout in Philadelphia or Pittsburgh, in those urban areas where the Democrats have a lot of historically significant support among labor unions, among voters of color, among other workers in those cities, if those numbers are not at the levels they need to be, that means they need to do well in the suburbs."
Ruben's the kind of person we need in Washington.
"Like they gained 5,000 voters, but Republicans gained over 21,000 voters."
"We understand that, but based off of the polls and based off of these numbers, it looks like they're just throwing random things up."
"You know, I do a PG show."
"Well, it's a great question."
"The question a bit and ask you what people you live with, people who vote for you, your friends, people you grow up with, what do they see in Donald Trump that makes them want to vote for him?"
"Yeah, I'm going to vote, but I can guarantee you, whoever wins, I'm going to ride their ass."
"But these people are now in our country and they always, you know, actually it's quite clever, I think, but you know, what do you do?"
"Back in Arizona tomorrow, my friend."
The Harris campaign knows it.
"And it is really, really good news for the Democratic Party in all Pennsylvania will be a state that could genuinely make or break the Republican or Democratic ticket."
"Both campaigns are making concerted efforts to ensure their supporters get to the polls, knowing that every vote in Pennsylvania could be decisive."
That's the first one.
There's been no comment otherwise from government entities about this.
"Yeah this maybe you're right I can't imagine that people that that are asking to and will be going to the Harris rally right tomorrow Just hate Joe, but like I don't Not hate or even well, I'm just I'm just here because it's not Joe Biden No, I think they're there because it's her but are you excited about her or you excited?"
"But based off of their own histories, their own track records, I don't think they're going to be correct."
Shouldn't be running.
"Donald Trump's recent legal victory in Pennsylvania, with the state Supreme Court upheld the requirements for mail-in ballots to be signed and dated, has significant implications for his chances in the upcoming presidential election."
Can you get me a meet-and-greet?
There he is.
"To show his love, try to win over the people of Pennsylvania to his side to become Republicans or whatever."
So it's not as if the region is shifting to the Republican side.
Trump's the greatest for security.
And we will start talking about greatness for our country again.
So her numbers have moved in a negative direction.
We begin our report on the campaign trail.
Just watch.
Big problems there.
And I think it looks favorable for the vice president.
"And the American people will only be able to convey their feedback through a customer satisfaction survey at the end of the call, and nobody will understand."
So it was standard in a few ways.
This offer is only going to be around for another 10 minutes.
"Again, with the betting favorites with Trump taking Pennsylvania, what happens when we turn Pennsylvania red?"
"The perception among voters, among a slight majority of voters that were Donald Trump to win, he would leave abortion up to the states."
"It was the first time I'm like, I'm happy I don't live in a swing state, because I don't think I could handle this, because even if you don't want to engage with it and you don't watch terrestrial TV, it's on the radio, the yard signs are everywhere."
You have you have some terrific people.
"Because Kamala goes around the country, she has said explicitly that she wants to give Social Security and Medicare benefits to people who don't have the legal right to be in this country in the first place."
"Inflation, immigration, and international conflicts were top of mind for many."
If there are any problems then it has to be looked at by both that Democrat and Republican and for them to say okay this is okay let's move this along.
"Technically, you don't own your steam games."
What is up with?
I think Kamala Harris has the momentum and is moving in the right direction and showing signs that she clearly understands how to campaign in our Commonwealth.
"The Republican Party of late September 2021 is a profoundly more radical party than it was on Election Day, than it was on January 6th, than it was on Inauguration Day."
You talk about what do you need to do to flip the state of Pennsylvania?
This guy.
"She said, absolutely."
"These are voters that they might have been voting Republican for the last like 10 to 15 years, but they still register as Democrats."
We don't need him here again for a while.
This was more than just a political rally.
I want that to continue.
"Meanwhile, back on the campaign trail, a local Pennsylvania journalist has raised concerns about the accessibility of Governor Walz to the press during a campaign event in Lancaster County on Wednesday."
There is no way.
So the deduction on Wall Street was it's going to be a governor.
"By the way, the Democratic party has also pushed numerous lawsuits to keep candidates like Jill Stein, candidates like Cornel West, off the ballot in swing states."
"So yesterday, Raphael Warnock, her surrogate on Meet the Press, gets asked about Kamala Harris' mandatory buyback of guns program from 2019."
Trump is doing a rally in Pennsylvania tonight.
You don't need me to tell you we live in what I believe are prophesied times.
And that's something that she's particularly under pressure to do right now.
"So what we're hearing with these leaks about her staff and that she's not there, she's not participating, mirrors what we heard from her staff that constantly left when she as being in the White House as vice president."
"Right now, he's slated to be the victor in Arizona."
"It's something way more unexpected and eating it just a few times a week could crush your energy, your motivation and your testosterone."
This is fascist.
"Nationally, I think his ceiling is probably 46% this time around with all the third party candidates."
"Well, I'm seeing this number here that Donald Trump has more support, although I'm seeing in the text that also Biden does have some support there."
"The two hour speeches, word salad, just, you know, it's like Fidel Castro, just on and on."
"That's why it's all, Oh, they say we've got record job growth."
We're not going back to that.
"When you think about where Kamala Harris was really improving support on for, compared to Joe Biden, minority voters, specifically black voters, in some of the polls that we saw with Biden in Pennsylvania, he was losing ground from black voters compared to 2020."
You have to realize it is literally possible.
So one of the clips that she has talked about is this comment from Donald Trump a couple days ago that there is an enemy within that might need to be dealt with by the military.
"Now if Harris is going to outperform Biden anywhere, it is going to be in a state like Georgia, with a high percentage of African American and young Democratic voters that simply were not energized by Biden's candidacy, to say the least."
He also said that the Republican Party has failed to preserve social freedoms.
"I mean, how did he I think he wanted Michelle to be the candidate?"
"When President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Kamala Harris stepped in, democratic enthusiasm went up."
"That doesn't mean that he is a part of, I think a mainstream or pro democracy wing of the Republican party here."
He's talking about Hannibal Lecter.
"And I believe Dearborn to be the greatest American city there is, coast to coast."
"Obviously, they weren't sizable enough to overtake him in the primary, but are they sizable enough to make the difference in the margins in the general election?"
Thursday night a small group of big political players in the Grand Canyon state greeted vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris at Sky Harbor International Airport she didn't address reporters but her supporters said they wouldn't miss the chance to welcome her to Arizona.
I did So decision made there.
Lloyd Benson.
So he said that he won the 2020 election.
"Here if you want even more detail, here's the whole website version of the wanted poster."
 It's a sprint to the finish line for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump.
And some special welcome to those watching us from the Sunshine State.
"And can I get, can I get him to walk me down?"
Kevin McCarthy needs Marjorie Taylor Greene right now to become elected speaker.
Or criminal referral rather to the U.S. Attorney General William Barr.
"And look, we're seeing this over and over again."
"According to some people, Kamala Harris is up by 15 points."
"Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz."
And he did a fist pump to let the people know that he was going to be okay.
"In his analysis of the next election in 2024, Shapiro described it not only as a contest between two political parties, but more as a referendum on the continuation of democratic values."
So it'll be him against likely be him against whoever the Republicans put up.
"Immediately, I saw that the White House on my Bluetooth was calling, and I took the call and I would presume the operator at the White House if I would hold for the president, which I did."
"When you think about it, the big guys only have one half."
He can turn that around.
Harris finished five points ahead of Trump in this poll.
"It was, but it was their best shot."
"Kaylee, just, Deakin's making a very good point here because Kamala Harris did come out in 2019 for these EV mandates."
A friendly couch named J.D.
"And then, of course, your two senators wanted to be here today."
I did look at us for a little bit.
Monica Garcia has the night off Vice president Kamala Harris came back to battleground Arizona today to visit the southern border for the first time as the Democratic presidential nominee And just her second time as vice president She spent the day in Cochise County and it comes as voting is set to begin in Arizona in under two weeks Who's for Tucson's political specialist Eric Fink reports from Douglas?
"And number two, the socioeconomic situation that we find ourselves in favors a populist platform like Trump's in places like Pennsylvania, in places like Nevada."
But Trump's solid base in Florida's Hispanic community keeps him firmly in the game.
"And helping us to sort through that is Mike Noble, the CEO and founder of Noble Predictive Insights, who joins us now on Arizona's Morning News."
So we'll have to wait and see on that front.
"Well, this is it."
So you can give that to Trump as well if you're trying to orchestrate his path to victory here doesn't seem like he's at risk of losing any single state that he won in 2020.
Allegheny County began to work on our home and worked quickly to get all of the lead removed.

Who's this?
When I first heard that we were abandoning or we're withdrawing from Afghanistan and the the way it was happening I had my Kennedy moment It was very similar to when we decided to invade Iraq back under President Bush and when I saw that we were leaving that amount of high-tech equipment in the hands of our enemy and Later that that day or later that week.

"That was the George W. Bush era, the Obama era, and then a little bit of the Trump era."
"In summation, Pennsylvania represents a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing Kamala Harris in her presidential ambitions."
So basically the debate was what?
Something was wrong here.
"A month and a half ago, Kamala Harris was not the presidential nominee."
"But anyway, let's keep on moving."
But good news coming out of Pennsylvania.
She just basically repeated everything that Biden has said in the past.
" Hey guys, welcome back to today's video."
"So my guess is, and it's an educated guess, this will be the one place you will see him on the ground for Kamala Harris."

What happens in your confidence in the election going forward?
"To what extent do we think that is because they're talking about either subsidies or tax breaks, lower taxes versus talking about, this is realistically what the cost it's going to come from longer term when we consider our debt and deficit."

"And despite all of the damage that Kamala has inflicted on the state and, you know, don't forget, she's the vice president."
Huh.
We'll go with Wilkes-Barre.
It's gone.
And so you can and then sort of switching and you can see how in certain cases these things are representative and reflective.
It's political poison.
"One of those members of the board of supervisors that they're talking about, Bill Gates, actually, also received this orange prison jumpsuit in the mail today after she sent out that email calling for them to be put in jail."

And then Kamala had the nerve to attack those Gold Star families when President Trump celebrated those families and the lives of the fallen soldiers at the Arlington Cemetery.

You have one out of Emerson.
Now a lot of them get on board the ones who don't get on board some have retired some have left some have been primary voted out and what's left is a conference that is much more aligned with the Trump agenda than what we saw in a first term.

"Again, return on investment."
I want to leave you with just a couple of final thoughts here.

They always go to the fake news.
So keep that in mind.
"You know, my dear friend, Senator Casey, do you expect that Senator Casey will run a little bit ahead of Vice President Harris?"

"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision is critical because it mandates that all mail-in ballots must be signed and dated by voters, and they must be returned within a specified timeframe."
So I think that I'm not sure how many persuadable voters there are out there.
"I mean, listen to our show on Apple podcasts or wherever you watch your show, Tim cast and Tim cast IRL hang out."
"So it shouldn't shock anyone that the polls are within a point or so, or even a dead heat."

He also had a lot of time or a lot of fun seemingly to poke at her rehab image over the last couple of weeks since Joe Biden's dropped out.

"51% were women, 48% were men."
"And the other one I pointed out in the video, this is incredible, too."

This race has turned nasty really in this final stretch.
But let's go over what's in this draft report.
It's so negative.
Harris is not really gaining a lot from 2020 and there's a lot of room that she apparently would have to grow.
And some media says you have... That would be called discipline.
Have you seen him lately?
"If you look at polls Trump is leading men by I think in the in an August Wall Street Journal poll he's leading men by about 10 points, Harris is leading women by about 13."

"If we have to go with another four years of these people, these people, and she's worse, and she's worse than Biden, in my opinion."
Her love of cooking and dreams of opening a restaurant are relatable to America's foodies.
 What Josh Shapiro brings to Pennsylvania is that he loves what he's doing and he has a passion and it's a ministry.

That's battleground Arizona right there.
It showed.
"They've launched three new ads since the debate, all highlighting exchanges in that debate, including ones on abortion, as well as Harris saying that she wants to represent all Americans."
But they do it with the Supreme Court justices.

"And in fact, even the Republican Attorney General of this state, Mark Bernovich, who initially said, I'm looking into this, I've heard the voter complaints about the potential issues of Sharpie's invalidating voters ballots, just said last night in a letter that indeed he had concluded that the use of Sharpie's in Maricopa County was not linked to any voters being disenfranchised here in this state."
"Especially in 2016, Democrats held their convention in Philadelphia."
"Let's, let's rate this on a scale from one to 10."
"And you know, when you talk to the Amish, they're just so down the earth."
"Again, I put this in a video, went out last night."
" Yeah, this is the most bizarre Trump event I think I've ever covered."
"Akayla, good morning."
And I think that's where it makes the most difference in Arizona for me.
It's not going to win talking about whether she's dumb.
I didn't know she was black until a few years ago when she became black and now wants to be known as black.
"But something that bulletproof glass and sheriffs on horseback can't do anything about is the subversion of elections by suppressing votes through the filing of frivolous lawsuits and stalling tactics to not only slow down the certification, but to sow doubt about the process in the minds of American voters."
"That's right, Tam, just weeks away from the election."
You got the shoulder on her.
"Here in Arizona, you don't even have to wait."
And they show how these two campaigns are trying to gather more voters in this state.
"And to some involved in the efforts, it's happening at the encouragement of former President Donald Trump."
"I mean, they are swing states because they are balanced on the edge of a knife."
"And they've simply sent us the information, they've taken it back, and they always have the same response of, hey, if this bill makes it to our desk, then we'll have a follow-up conversation."
"And I think what's important too, in terms of like what's happening more broadly from a 30,000 foot view is having these people who, who are long time, lifelong Republicans, I mean, Liz Cheney is one of the most conservative members of Congress that, that I could remember having these people who then, who then see an opening with Democratic politicians like Kamala Harris, that will bring a whole, like a whole swath of people, like kind of as a gateway into, into, into what is okay about democratic politics."
Druid Hills is blue.
"And Pennsylvania, by the way, we're the second largest natural gas producing state in the nation."
And just looking through these key counties on the eastern half of Pennsylvania.
"I mean, what are you going to stop?"
"And in places that it will be on the ballot, Arizona, Florida, these will be big test cases for whether if you support the measure, do you also in turn vote for Biden, right?"
"I think generally, the polls are going to be relatively accurate, but when they're this close, I mean, one percentage point can completely change the outcome."
"Well, we don't know there Biden's local ties and cultural roots left him to victory in 2020 here But obviously as Democrats battle for the state Kamala Harris is their nominee, you know, she's not a Catholic man she is a California woman of color who is spearheaded post-dab as a porcelain messaging So she's an awkward fit political rights for the state of Pennsylvania, you know have a hard-pressed working-class region That's historically been a locus of anti-abortion activity So I don't know if every like if a majority of voters are actually anti-abortion but again, it's She does remind the voters there of She doesn't Biden reminded them of the older Democrats more focused on economic messages then Kamala who's focused more on abortion and democracy and other stuff like that and Obviously they say here Biden's discomfort we're talking about abortion may have been a Swiss spot modern for the Democrats but Paris by contrast like It's you know For voters that like Northeastern is Pennsylvania Catholics."
I just don't approve of her views on Israel.
"So folks, together, we will propel great cities like Pittsburgh into the future with safer, healthier, and more resilient water infrastructure."
He's white and Republican and they're going to protect him somehow.
We just saw last week where one day he told another network that he was going to vote in a way that signaled his opposition to a six-week abortion ban in Florida.
"But these numbers right now are so bad for her that how could anyone say as of now, Harris is the clear favorite in Pennsylvania?"
The borough manager isn't the only Pennsylvania official speaking out against Trump's attacks on the Haitian community in Charleroi.
"What you see in my opponent, a former president of the United States, really is, it demeans the office."
And it is a very straightforward thing.
It doesn't smell right.
It says independent presidential candidate Cornell West lost the legal challenge Friday in his bid to get on the ballot in the ballot ground battleground state of Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court judge Renee Cone Jubileerer in a 15 page opinion sided with the Secretary of State's office under Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro in rejecting West candidacy paperwork The Secretary of State's office said West campaign lacked or card affidavits for 14 of the West 19 presidential electors So what I think is kind of going on to I don't know if that's the case here But what it looks like is I guess a lot of the states required maybe in addition to signatures also these electors who are Promising to vote for you But what ended up happening in the state of Arizona?
It's real.
"Yeah, I also think I think economy."
And it's not surprising that it's the first place that we've seen President Joe Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris.
And this is why Rupert Murdoch and some others are pulling the ripcord and trying to get the hell out of here.
But there's two butlers.
"And I thought that was a crazy idea, but he did it."
"We can't stand you, you're a... Vice president."
"Trump 49, Trump 50."
I've never seen a politician bragging about raising taxes on American citizens and then rewarding companies that ship American jobs overseas.
Harris's ability to consolidate support among younger voters and suburban residents in Pennsylvania has given her a narrow lead.
"I'm not saying he's, but I say that I am much better looking than her."
So Donald Trump will be in a Philly suburb later today.
"It didn't matter if you list 10, 15 policies that they all like, everything that he was doing as a president, but they weren't willing to vote for him."
"But yet they're very much enjoying this contrast of President Biden continuing to be on the trail, continuing to have that flexibility."
You think they liked him the whole time?
I want to talk about this in the future because I think this can genuinely sum up exactly what we need to know about the past three weeks.
"And here's the Secretary of State's office saying, hi, Attorney General, crime here."
"I tell you, so if it, if it gets the point where we do see a huge shift in the demographic and don't get me wrong, people keep talking about black men, but black women, black women are, are, are, you know, they, they, they're the biggest demographic for the democratic party, but they don't vote in the same percentage either."
" Kamala Harris is in Pennsylvania tonight, which may very well be the most important tipping point state in this year's election."
"And, uh, good luck to you."
We'll continue that trip planning ahead of the presidential election.
Trafalgar Whitmer plus one.
"We've spent a lot of time covering him in the western part of the state, more rural parts of the state here in Pennsylvania."
The one debate they had was in Philadelphia.
That's what's happening to your face with the cheap razors.
This is an illustration of why Donald Trump is going to win the state of Pennsylvania.
"The stakes are undeniably high, not only for candidacy, but also for the Democratic Party's future viability in an increasingly polarized political environment."
"So for that being said, let's get it."
"Now, his remarks were twice interrupted by medical emergencies in the crowd."
So who knows what they're going to do.
"That's just not something that happens because when it gets identified, there are severe consequences, whether it's prosecution and or deportation from the country."
"And honestly, the conversations among those groups were very positive."
The two of them at the top of the ticket.
"I mean, you're crazy if you do believe you."
"Clearly, the rhetoric one of the candidates has is pretty ugly and cruel."
"But that margin in Pennsylvania, Joe, might be giving them some cause to worry in the Trump campaign."
"She will continue, allow it to continue."
So what'd she say?
"But so on abortion, 57% in Pennsylvania say Harris is better 38% say Trump in Michigan 53% say Kamala Harris is better 42% for Donald Trump in Wisconsin 53% of likely voters say Kamala Harris is better on abortion 40% say Trump and the final one the final issue a crisis that put the country at risk in Pennsylvania 49% say Harris over Trump at 47% 51% in Michigan say Harris 47% for Trump in Wisconsin 49% for Harris 48% for Trump."
"So major implications not just for the midterms but also looking ahead to 2024, Kenneth."
"But in Arizona, you've got to additionally provide documented proof of citizenship to vote in all of our state systems."
And we've seen that rhetoric heightened over the past couple of weeks and especially over the weekend.
"Look, Wolf, this election could very well be decided by which candidate better articulates an economic message."
Donald Trump will be the next president.
"If the ruling leads to fewer valid mail-in ballots for Democrats, it could increase Trump's chances of winning the state."
Let's dive deep into the evolving dynamics of these critical states.
"Not just because of one pollster having Harris plus four because if you're up by only one, hell, you're not even up by a point, you're still tied."
That's a fun one to look up.
"Like, maybe this is just misinformation, whatever."
Arizona is an actual border state.
"And, and, and you hear all these rumors and, and, and I think back to when Trump, and we'll put this in the, in the post and it'll look really cool."
"Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump toured hurricane damage in Georgia earlier today, before participating in a town hall event in North Carolina."
"My all time favorite chart, by the way."
"It adds they are investigating all angles, but it appears to have been a terrorist attack."
It's really hard to say what's really happening here.
They're going to ask her about the border bill.
"Why do people want to show up for an event that she's at not everybody wants to go to one of these events and This thing I mean people want in droves want to go to this in my life I've never wanted to go to one and I never will I don't like politicians and I don't I don't put them on a pedestal Okay, but it's interesting by the way, I hear she might be laying to get Luke."
"Because he understood tariffs, I charged him massive hundreds of millions of din- dollars China paid to the United States."
And this is a neck and neck race.
"So it looked, if it turns out that it's less than 90% of black women voted for Kamala, then you know, it's real."
And you certainly wouldn't put them in charge of anything.
I'm really glad to be back.
It was called a blue mirage.
This is massive.
"The birds are back, baby."
All of that is true.
And I think that continual lying about the last election is affecting how people approach this election.
It's a runaway.
"Yeah, go ahead."
"Just like or like Trump, people have a pretty good sense of those."
It was run like they run elections in a banana republic.
That's the message from one Republican Arizona state senator threatening members of her own party to watch their backs for refusing to push the big lie and support the baseless Arizona election audit.
"This is not the only poll to come out recently, showing Harris in a tight race."
Well we need to fill some more time.
"In my opinion, the Republicans best issue."
"But, but Alex, how does that become some kind of a conspiracy theory?"
"Which is interesting because two weeks ago, 11 House Republicans from Florida voted against keeping the government and FEMA fully funded."
And did they also press him for proof of these allegations?
"Congressman Scott Perry, Republican from the state of Pennsylvania."
"The four-point swing has, in fact, narrowed down Pennsylvania quite tremendously, and the three recent polls here are tremendous ones for Kamala Harris's campaign, because they show a consistency, a consistency that we hadn't seen in Pennsylvania for quite some time, unless it was predicting that Joe Biden was losing the state to Donald Trump."
"And I want to thank all of the leaders who are here, including Administrator Michael Regan."
The result is an homage to the franchise while simultaneously moving the story for later.
"I got elected governor, she went to the U.S. Senate and then the vice presidency and we've maintained a close relationship and I think she's an extraordinary public servant."
Maybe he doesn't understand.
"Also, please remember to share this video with your friends and family if you really, really, really like the video."
What are they saying?
"In August, Harris received 50 percent of the vote and Trump received 47 percent."
He'll read it and he'll go.
"However, what we could see from this poll is this Insider Advantage name."
"Donald Trump, the 45th and former president, receives 45 percent of the vote."
"Hypothetically, what if the shooter couldn't afford a more high caliber deadly weapon because of inflation?"
That was a terrible thing.
What do you find interesting at this point?
"Oh, yeah, I mean, yeah, it was it was a surprise."
So What did she do as vice president?
She's already trying to steal the 2024 election right here in this beautiful facility.
They got the shooter.
Finally in early March Susquehanna had Biden leading Trump 50-45.
"By demonstrating effectiveness in achieving legal and policy goals, Trump's campaign can solidify support among Republican voters and enhance its position within the party."
"But then in this question, when offered some options after being told that one million immigrants enter this country legally every year, MSNBC viewers, a pretty good portion of them, one third want a level of legal immigration lower than it currently is."
"For Harris to capitalize on this, she must not only mobilize these demographics, but also craft a narrative that resonates with independents and moderate republicans."
There's Nola.
And it's also controversial because it extracts fossil fuels.
Now we know the economy is the number one issue for voters coming up after the break.
Do they turn out for Biden?
"I can sit all day long and have disagreements over fiscal policy, over the fine points of immigration policy, how we deal with border security."
We're not going to turn on the heating tonight because we can't afford it.
You have to run the table everywhere.
They're all for Trump.
"Harris leads former President Donald Trump in Arizona and North Carolina, while trailing narrowly in Nevada."
It is neck and neck in Michigan.
"So earlier in the evening, it started when we saw a group of people with cameras, they had cell phones and they said that they were journalists."
She's a criminal.
"And even if you want to compare like the polls today to the polls back then in a lot of these 2022 races, they were, you know, more accurate than the final aggregates were."
Hundreds of people killed and President Biden and Vice President Harris were down there meeting with local officials and comforting families asking how they could help and Donald Trump at a rally just started making up stories about the Biden administration withholding aid from Republican areas and siphoning off aid to give to undocumented immigrants.
"All you do when you go vote is they'll ask you, do you want a Democratic ballot or Republican win?"
It can be misleading and I'm not denying that part of this is because of former Democrats that have been voting Republican for 30 years.
Now Republicans lead by registered party by like 10%.
And drink your drink something if you got it.
Both candidates will make the case for why they are better either now or better four years ago.
"No matter all the arguments, the pro-arguments for Donald Trump, January 6th tips the skills every single time for me, that we just cannot have a sitting president of the United States inside a violent attack on the Capitol like that, because he's upset that he lost the election."
"What comes to places like Johnstown, which isn't often visited by presidential candidates in previous elections, is because this is where America got left behind, where people, when they offshored the steel industry and other manufacturing industries and even during the Biden administration, right, those inflation numbers, those jobs numbers, it's not even across the country."
"You're just mad whenever you lose, even though Mark Zuckerberg admitted in a letter to Jim Jordan that, yeah, I mean, I mean that letter is earth shattering."

"Now, I think you all know where I'm going with this, don't you?"
"I remember the stories about getting John Thurman elected and how many people brought buses to Pennsylvania to get people on board, drive them to the polling station."
"The Muslim ban, the annexation of the Golan Heights, elimination of all A towards Palestinians during his term."
"And it is like I was talking about the numbers on it, but why is she there specifically, do you think?"
So that's why all of this election integrity is so important.
She's most likely going to win by about 10 points at most.
"Yeah, most polling has Harris up by the narrowest narrowest of margins maybe one to two points So within the margin of error essentially it could go either way with the margin of error It's arguable that Donald Trump actually has the lead You could ask me this question every day from now until November 5th And I think the answer will be the same either candidate could really plausibly win it a small shift at any point Right up to election day could really change the outcome We start wondering what causes one campaign or the other to break out if anything They're both still laying out new policy proposals today Kamala Harris aiming a series of proposals that young black men with business incentives an effort to legalize Cannabis on the federal level Donald Trump continues to introduce tax deductions."
"And the more informed we are, the better choices we can make."
And the margin in the state's lower chamber is a single seat.
But just him as a person.
"Tia, what's the analog to this in Atlanta?"
"And so really, 52 to 46 is already a game for Kamala Harris, well, yesterday, three point gain in terms of odds and chances based on the betting markets."
Some light bedtime reading.
"Okay, here we go."
"Number two, the jobs have been added because the COVID is over or, or I'm not going to say it's over."
"ZACH HUDAK, CNN News Reporter, CBS News There's no question both these campaigns view Pennsylvania as nearly a must-win state."

"So if we can applaud their leadership, please."
"He'd say build the wall, lock her up, etc."
"I think that's a successful way to go after your opponent, is to talk about their record."
"And then at the very end, it becomes a little bit better."
"Looking at the graph, we can see that it is a highly contested battle between Harris and Trump."
The election is fundamentally done.
"And a lot of times, when we're filling in these seven states, it comes down to Pennsylvania."
I can care about your company and what your employees do.
I have a feeling that he would have been tougher than her.
But I think this also applies to illegal aliens.
"... Well, today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which means it's a day full of Republican politicians who support voter suppression efforts and have spent months fanning a crazed right-wing panic over so-called critical race theory, deceptively quoting Dr. King out of context like the new governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin, who signed an executive order banning the teaching of critical race theory on his first day in office and then went on Fox News and quoted Dr. King."
So I'm sorry if some of that was a rehash for everybody.
Those are just a few.
Will there be any guardrails for another Trump presidency?
It doesn't.
"Okay, that's true."
"Again, Harris leads this poll by one point."

There was no state of the union bump whatsoever.
"You know, where the geese are in the park, in the lake, and even walking off with their pets."
Now we have some new polling data out of Michigan.
Same poll had Biden up and sit by similar margins before Democrats forced him out.
They understand that too many folks not just here in Arizona but across the country are still struggling to pay the bills.

"We see between Joe Biden and going all the way back to Barack Obama, there's only been a few percentage points, like a one and a half percent difference between the campaigns."
We're seeing some pictures likely from earlier of a motorcade being taken out and security personnel and camouflage heading in with long guns surely trying to secure the area.
And I know the Biden campaign makes it seem like North Carolina is in play.
The security guard came running.
"No, no, I'm sorry."
I'll start with you.
"And one of them, and this is where the vice president is going on her way right now, is Luzerne County."
Like she didn't feel heard at all.
Because I found that exchange quite interesting on the debate stage.
And here now we've got a situation where a lot of Republicans are voting for the Harris Walls ticket.
We don't know if he was grazed.
"But I think it's important to note that we shouldn't really, in my opinion, count any polls before the debate because that was a huge event and some of the polling numbers have really changed."
"Today, we're diving into the polls for the 2024 US presidential election, focusing specifically on TENSILVANIA, a state known for its razor-thin election results."
So it says new general election poll.
"I mean, because that, you know, there's nothing more important than getting to the bottom of the truth."
"There's two in Pennsylvania that went twice for Obama, then went for Trump, and then Biden got him back."
"Yeah, why even wait?"
What's your sense of how it's going to go after election night in terms of we're just going to have to get used to the fact that we may not all get results on election night?
"Read stuff from different news outlets, even ones you think you might disagree with."
They are dumping money into the state.
Natural gas is the way in which we heat most of our homes in Western Pennsylvania.
"The last time an attempt at a U.S. president's life was actually successful was 1963, John F. Kennedy."
That's a strong man right there Make sure to let me describe and definitely appreciate y'all stay tuned with today's video.
This is just a fun way to take off the heat off the election.
I like election day.
Having the right people in place to execute the strategy.
"But these numbers are way off from where they are supposed to be, at least in accordance to 2020."
A MAGA hat wouldn't have been as bad as the Trump 2024.
"And obviously, 2020 was a pandemic year."
"It was a lead that had been pretty substantial and had been maintained for quite some time, but was building up in the immediate aftermath of the first presidential debate that ultimately ended with Joe Biden dropping out of the presidential race."
Now Quinnipiac also had Trump only winning Iowa in 2020 by one.
"Remember back in 2016 when Jill Stein got 1% of the vote in Michigan, Trump won it by 0.3%."
There is also this clip circulating this morning that's going viral.
"According to the polling, the vice president is leading by three percentage points nationally, a smaller margin than last month."
"Long a reliably conservative state, the Atlanta metropolitan region has rapidly diversified over the last decade, much like Phoenix back in Arizona, with an influx of left-leaning college grads and minority voters helping push Biden over the edge in an extraordinarily high turnout election in 2020."
But his candidacy was challenged by Democrats.
Robert I know we started off the evening where you said you're not sure who you may support.
Take a look at this when it comes to election integrity.
My wife was like pounding high noons when we tested positive.
"Now, the one region nobody is talking about, everyone's so focused on Philadelphia, Western Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh area, there is one region that absolutely has devastated Democrats."
There were new polls that dropped out of the state of Michigan and he's leading in every single swing state.
The early vote metrics for black women are up 250% from 2022.
"I know what this kind of rhetoric can lead to, and it leads nowhere good."
A Republican's not going to win a campaign in California.
"I was like, oh, no, sir."
I understand that fracking has been a large driver of industry in Pennsylvania.
The crowd is going absolutely bonkers.
"Quinnipiac University showed that in Pennsylvania, Kamala Harris had a slight edge over Donald Trump in what they argued to be a tight race."
All righty.
"And then other issues like, you know, like we end up kind of like tending to go along with whatever the people in our tribe say, right?"
He thought he was facing Joe Biden.
"But if you had Trump's voter base up and you give give all the Haley voters to bite, I'm not sure."
Another top pollster and one that doesn't do as many statewide polls and doesn't do that many national polls frequently.
It's not quite as close as the presidential race.
Don't ask me.
And this is where you are today with Dr. Oz.
Wealthy white women with a college degree are going to go for heels up probably 85 to 15.
"But still, this is a really good sign."
And probably doesn't vote for Donald Trump and probably never voted for Donald Trump.
What follows next is an incredible adventure that will touch your heart.
"Please give us a call back, sir."
"Minister, Minister Obama right there, boys."
"His defense team sought to limit such details, arguing they amount to character assassination, but the judge has promised to control the introduction of salacious evidence."
But he's at 48 in Michigan.
And I don't blame her because it's not a good one.
And today I'm announcing a plan to address the shortage.
But Trump didn't really get it.
So it is what it is.
And so right now the audit of the 2020 presidential election results in Arizona is somehow ongoing.
That shows total incompetence.
"Yeah, even if I move this, it's still a Trump win."
Names.
"You know, there's tens of thousands of us, probably more than that, that we will all be standing in a bread line because if you shut the oil field down, then like all my eggs are in this basket and lots of guys, all our eggs are in the oil field."
Do you see the problem?
That's why Kamala Harris herself avoids the question.
"Every legal scholar felt and felt for a long time for 53 years, they've been trying to do it."
"And then something that doesn't get a lot of attention is the fact that the federal government is spending America into bankruptcy, which is crazy."
Very confusing.
"And so I, it's not like she's sacrificing anything, you know, on her left flank to kind of bring these people in."
"And there are strong elements of economic performance during his tenure, particularly when it comes to job creation."
What are the songs we're getting?
It's been a while.
But it is a general election campaign for a Democrat that actually is interested in in winning and not just winning for the sake of it.
"Kamala's anti-Catholic, according to Trump."
Their work at the end just reaffirmed President Joe Biden's win there.
"We've got almost 10,000 jurisdictions in the United States of America."
Can you explain how you're going to pay for those?
"Poly Market, I think is kind of like crypto based."
And we even constituted our own private investigation because I don't trust the federal government.
"They could still play a spoiler role, but not for the reasons that they anticipated."
Has a lot of people.
Pennsylvania is poised to be one of the most critical battleground states this cycle.
"My friends, that's how we're going to win this election."
"And I don't think on election day, it will be Harris plus five."
"Now, importantly, this is a wild and baseless conspiracy theory that voting machines in your county were connected to the Internet on Election Day and somehow Italian satellites were utilized to change votes from Trump to Biden."
It's like Bruce Lee meets The Hunger Games with a little bit of squid game thrown in for good measure.
"It's always a nail-biter, right?"
"Marjorie Taylor Greene says, if she and Steve Bannon had been in charge, listen."
She's trying to say that somehow Donald Trump is going to go after Social Security and Medicare.
We did a whole video on this.
"She said that he wasn't serious, sort of called into question his temperament and character."
You see how that works.
He's endorsed by Donald Trump.
"Negative partisanship is the most effective campaigning tool in any race, from city council to the race for president."
"Right now, make sure you enjoy, comment, and subscribe."
"Um, I wanted to hear more about how he felt about the central banking system And I know he's probably like the only president that I heard talk about that in the Federal Reserve So I was really interested in hearing what he had to say about that and I also would like to hear more about how he feels about You know black and justices in America I Really hear so many issues of people saying that Trump is racist But I would like for him to talk on that subject in particular Many in the media do call him racist for years now."
"It is said, the winner of Pennsylvania will win."
They came into office bragging that they were going to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.
And I thought that's what was so compelling about Tim Walts' speech last night.
Did people like working with it?
They're so excited to be part of this movement because it is a movement.
"Well, in the past few elections, we've seen that the Latino vote, the Latino electorate has sort of been shifting away from the Democrats and particularly here in South Florida."
And so this is the calm that's happening in this room.
That last yard and a half to get to the other side is hard.
I grew up a middle class kid.
"I mean, it's obvious on its face."
Pennsylvania is once again poised to be a decisive battleground in the 2024 election.
"Congressman Deluzio and Congresswoman Lee, thank you all for joining us."
"And when you look at this race right now, is that they're gonna they're gonna have to make a movie on this race because there's so many plot twists and twists and turns."
"So really, like you said, hitting home on who are you and who will you be if you are in that seat?"
The Susquehanna missing the final result by two points in either direction for 2016 and 2020.
So this is a pretty good number that we have here in Pennsylvania.
"So who wins, who loses?"
"The indoor venue allowed for more controlled access, with attendees undergoing multiple security checks before entering."
"She got out of her car, and she started pacing around kind of aimlessly and weirdly."
You can see the city of St. Petersburg got 18 inches of rain.
But you see how important these three states are to both of these candidates.
"I'm on one side, David McCormick's on the other."
"Today, both candidates are holding rallies in the key battleground state of Michigan."
I am playing it as if Trump might win and I should be more optimistic.
"Not me though, I have bad eyesight."
It finds that right now the race for the White House is close with Kamala Harris having a one point edge over former President Trump nationally.
"But former President Trump has his own issues in Pennsylvania, the suburbs."
But I've had a great partnership with the Biden-Harris administration that's allowed me to do so much of this work.
I'm Mary Season.
"Well, take a look here."
"You know, whether if he accepts money or not, he's made of money prior to all this."
I think you're going to see a massive Trump outperformance here.
"He's going to cut the business tax rate to 15 percent, but only for companies that make their product in America and hire American workers is going to make America competitive again and bring jobs back here at home."
"And from that point, when Kamala Harris was attorney general, she went after drug smugglers, human traffickers."
Appreciate it.
"Let's see Elaine Godfrey, Tess Owen."
But that has gotten harder.
"But Ruben and I were talking to a remarkable group of men right before we came out, and we were talking about this, and somebody said, man, I'm just so tired of everybody being divided and mean and nasty."
They're going to continue to fight price gouging and these junk fees that the Biden-Harris administration has been taking dead aim at.
"If you send Reuben Gayle to the Senate, he'll vote to restore the reproductive freedom that women had for nearly 50 years."
I also care about healthcare.
And the best way to do it over the next couple of weeks is to get people out there to vote for Donald J. Trump and all of our great candidates here in the state of Arizona.
And he's continuing to make statements that's helping Kamala Harris increase her lead in the general election.
They're not going to vote on Election Day compared to 2020.
"You tell me at the end of the day, you know what I'm saying?"
Sputes that election officials in the courts have found no merit to allegations of fraud or errors.
"He's teamed up with fellow Republican, former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett."
"I think that they've sort of blown their load, though, already and they failed."
Take a photo.
That other guy.
"I mean, obviously none of these audits are actually going to change the result of the election."
That really hits home how much every single vote matters.
We've heard him engage in race baiting Kamala Harris.
"Amish f conservative, their quali everything to them."
"Now, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken now in a visit aimed at intensifying diplomatic pressure to achieve a Gaza ceasefire deal."
So this is the actual envelope in these where the ballots are returned in?
I just like to eat.
"In this analysis, we will delve into the recent polling results from Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada, focusing on key metrics, voter sentiment, and the implications for the candidates involved."
We know the campaign's working hard to turn out their voters It's what they call the ground game our political director and Washington bureau chief Rick Klein Has the latest on the key aspect of the race with new polling out this morning.
I think that she seems to have a reasonable approach to a pathway to citizenship.
We're forced to provide full coverage right here on ABC News Live all day long.
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 49% each.
So this has a cascading effect.
I'm going to keep those conversations private.
"Now, when you watch this, you'll see the interaction here and the guy who he takes the hat from ends up calling him like, I'm proud of you, you'll fart and all this other kind of stuff."
"And now, eight years after he was elected, after all the arguments against Obamacare have been proven to be wrong, and even folks who don't like me sure like that insurance."
"But it's a very, very important state."
Do we have a sense of the strategy here?
So what do you do about the big mills in the South?
"Instead of sort of trying to make as much of a policy contrast, particularly on economic issues, she has been going after him personally, after his felony convictions, after his behavior, his temperament."
"And I want to ask you, what's your plan?"
And there are lots of union workers in my region who rely on that industry.
I know about golf.
"And what you have are the latest political science techniques being used to identify voters, register voters, keep track of voters and make certain they vote."
What school is that?
There's going to be a lot less mail-in ballot votes just because it's not COVID anymore.
We were told that here in Maricopa County which is the largest county by far in Arizona its Phoenix and its suburbs is what it includes is that they can run about six to eight thousand ballots an hour.
So Trump's going to make up more ground in terms of the popular vote.
We have to take care of the Earth through stories like that.
So I don't really question Quinnipiac support for Harris in this.
Donald Trump would break 50% in Pennsylvania.
We got a lot more work to do.
"For each candidate, they will be simple triumphs."
Pennsylvania's got the fourth largest natural gas reserves in the world.
Are you gonna call any of your friends in Pennsylvania?
There is no summit we cannot reach.
Our country is dying.
"Well, this one's about 30% complete so far, this Elon Musk painting."
We'll talk about a little more a little later before we get to the polling numbers.
"Yes, and I've again worked on that My values have not changed."
"But what he does know about his golf, he says, play the clip."
"You know, if passes prologue, yes."
And I think that showed the Democratic Party that there's a pathway to victory through Gen Z.
"And this has been happening for decades with, you know, back since Obama's first green stimulus."
"We're never in a fair shake from Kamala Harris or her media allies, but we can tell the truth to one another."
You all remember these arrows.
And that question goes right to the heart of it.
We've got great designs.
"Nyle Scanage, White House columnist at The Hill, among a number of other titles at our sister publication."
"Unfortunately, I have a feeling it's going to be happening more than once every 1,000 years."
Let me see the chart.
He's a bold leader of the EPA.
Judge for yourself.
You could even argue Wisconsin.
I want to save Shapiro.
"I mean, I'm sure you and I will be talking about this during the next primaries that come."
And this is a sample?
It shows Donald Trump defeating Kamala Harris by 3 percentage points.
They're roughly 9% of the electorate in that specific county.
"We can take a look at Michigan, for instance, where Harris now leads by two points."
"Anthony, good to see you."
"Also in Arizona, I know we've been talking about the presidential race, but they have a really key Senate race there between Ruben Gallego, who's a current congressman, and Kerry Lake, the Republican."
"Democrats added only 17,000."
So that's really the way that it is.
And it's going to be tight because a lot of Americans are struggling right now.
So I take it real seriously.
You mentioned he's won everyone pretty widely.
"Next up, Donald Trump tells the same exact story he told over a year ago where he claims that he watched somebody shoplift and carry a refrigerator."
I thought it goes bad.
"And that's why they've come into this state, not just to attack Kamala, but also in a very focused way to attack me."
"Oath Keepers sounds like a yellow jacket's knockoff about a group of teen girls who have to keep a terrible secret, although I would definitely watch a show about a group of teen girls, plus Donald Trump, who had to keep a secret because it would be only a half an episode before he gave it up."
"So, yeah, later in the debate, they did agree that they could agree on some things around gun safety, but not much."
"Because some people think the people, the rally goers, the attendees, the guests are crazy for showing up to a place where somebody tried to kill another person."
"And so that's why at least with Trump, we're going to get some dialogue moving in the direction of potential peace as opposed to Democrats bragging about signing shells that are going to be used to, you know, in Russian territory."
Now you're talking about an eight point electorate advantage that lines up with what we expect.
It could be Detroit for you in November.
Polls of Pennsylvania in the presidential race are even closer.
"Their support, driven by a range of interests from health care and education to economic equity and environmental protection, reflects the diverse coalition Harris has built as she seeks the presidency."
"Which seems like, doesn't seem like a great strategy."
We are polling very good with LDS.
"And finally, a town in California was on edge after someone reported a mountain lion sighting on their ring camera."
"I just don't see how you lose Pennsylvania or win Pennsylvania, but somehow lose the presidency at that point."
"Oh, I thought it was coming from the necklace."
"I think it'd be more likely that if this poll is correct, it'd be more like 51 49 for Trump, for Harris, excuse me, in Pennsylvania, where Trump gets up to 49 and Harris wins by two."
"I mean, what did she do in the span of three months?"
"Like, yeah, it sucks, but it's not as important regionally and demographically as Pennsylvania."
"Like my in-laws, they like to watch actual cable television and like sitting there, being bombarded with those ads is maddening, especially, I think when we're watching the Phillies game, every single commercial break is just, it's literally Trump ad, Kamala ad, Dave McCormick ad, Bob Casey ad, then whoever the congressional candidate is, I'm like, I'm gonna lose my goddamn mind."
"Are they moving the stage, or is it in the same place?"
Bella Kinwood is in Montgomery County.
"There's one other of that, you know, literal ping pong counties, Northampton right here in the northeast part of the state."
Has anyone thought about unplugging America and plugging it back in again?
"Okay, Secret Service encircled Trump within seconds of the shots being fired and the agency statement is that the former president is safe."
"Are you confident about the election infrastructure in your state, about the sort of these kind of county-level canvassing boards, any kind of mischief that folks in the Trump campaign might get up to to get people to not do what is essentially their legal duty to count certified votes?"
"But now for the first time, I'm beginning to think it might be an age issue."
"However their recent poll in mid September had Trump gaining a single point to hit 46 while Harris dropped 4 to tie him at 46, another tie, a net gain of 5 for Trump."
And the presidential race.
She's very left of center.
"Thank you so much, sir."
What are you going to do for them?
It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as their citizens of color are concerned.
Interest rates dropping today.
Sort of.
Just want to throw that out there.
And then you've also got this going on at the same time on the same day.
We're going to have to get Elon to explain that.
"Lastly, Kamala Harris is bracing for a massive pro-Palestine protest at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago."
"Yeah, it's really, really well said."
"Well, which is why, you know, some of these left-leaning pollsters in the midterms were more accurate than these right-leaning pollsters were in the midterm."
Arizona visited Biden in 2020 at 0.3.
"I think she's doing really well and she seems to have a lot of momentum and I donated to the campaign and it sounds like she's doing really good with her fundraising, so yeah things look good."
We did have a special guest come on stage at one point.
You're totally fucked.
"And we know, according to polling, according to, you know, some very preliminary early data, that we have in North Carolina and Georgia, seems like the turnout dynamic is going to give Donald Trump a boost in those two states."
But watching this early vote will give us an insight into what's going to be happening.
"And when Joe Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020, he won it by a pretty dowdy margin."
So maybe we'll make a Maha skateboard.
"However, in recent years, it has shifted more decisively toward the Republican party."
So it's totally legal.
Her campaign just issued a statement.
I'm excited that he's here.
And she's chosen the person that she believes can help her win this election and that she believes can help her best govern.
Scranton's a place that climbs into your heart and it never leaves.
"Harris simply isn't performing as well as the prior three nominees, though."
"And the last time there was a really impressive, I think this is right, black turnout there was with Obama and everybody's tried hard and Biden got a huge percentage."
She has said that she does not align herself with those views.
"This was a plot to make sure that America never becomes first again, because his supporters already think he's the second coming of Jesus."
Everyone's voting.
This poll also had some insight into what voters are feeling just about Trump and Harris as candidates generally and their approval ratings.
I'm a fan of Peter.
"In fact, Trump is now so confident of victory that he has begun moving beyond the battleground states to stage rallies in democratic strongholds like California."
"And in prime video, check out Jackpot."
"Two hours ago, so big tweets out Shapiro and Zelensky visits our visit artillery shell plant in Scranton."
That's what I want to see in the President of the United States of America.
"Yeah, and it's interesting just to see how tight the race is, just 63 days out, it's pretty remarkable to watch."
We have to understand there's going to be less mail in voting in 2024.
"Though she hasn't cracked 15, Kamala Harris is doing better."
"Bowers testified about how he denied Trump's request to overturn his loss in Arizona by 10,457 votes by potentially removing Joe Biden's electors in the state."
Kamala Harris is not going to be able to accomplish such.
"You know, we have a tremendous shortage because they haven't been treated right."
"And what has happened since the 2020 election when Donald Trump narrowly lost against Joe Biden, lost the state of Pennsylvania, okay?"
"And in fact, a lot of these policies are exactly in line with what these long-time Republicans have been advocating for, especially in terms of, of, of freedom, bodily autonomy and, and, and on and on."
Yes it is about winning and we will win.
So we remember.
The notion that the other side is worse than ours.
I'll ask this question to you.
You have candidates for office threatening to lock people up.
They're concerned about that.
"It's a small one, but compared to 2020 and 2016, this is a big lead for him."
That's incredible.
"Final question, if this election were to be held tomorrow, where would you be putting your money?"
Okay is Kamala Obama 2.0 nothing to do with skin color.
"Yes, I did, sir."
"That facility, along with many others in Arizona, are recipients of ChIPS Act funding, which former President Trump has criticized on occasion."
"You know, this is a campaign in which Kerry Lake was the front runner for the better part of the last year ever since announcing her bid."
Do you think that that issue remains such a potent driver in this election?
"So 48, 14, 18, 22, 26 minus three is 23, 1234567."
I've spent a lot of time there particularly in 2020 The people there are unsure about it say there's actually a divide between it is either bear or Barry It's named after a guy named Isaac B-a-r-r-e with an accent in a French pronunciation But there there is indecisiveness even on the level of how to pronounce that in that County that is in Lezern County which is particularly fascinating because that is a Obama Obama Trump Trump County It's a place that about five years before Donald Trump really even stepped onto the political stage a guy named Lou Barletta ran from Hazleton the neighboring town to Wilkes-Barre and kind of set the playbook for a populist candidate like Donald Trump years before he did it so this is a place that Harris sees potential VP Harris sees potential to win back an area that traditionally has been a bit red but that Obama president Obama was able to win only about a decade ago So we got some new polling numbers out from Reuters and it shows Harris up five points over Trump nationwide I mean when we're talking about such a close race five points is kind of significant I think over half the respondents also said that they viewed Harris as a winning the debate against Trump So I don't know about this this poll.
"But we have right here for these two guys, and we see the Hill, Marist."
"I'm sorry, gentlemen."
Says Pennsylvania is such a mess and it's incredibly frustrating.
"As of right now, I'm going to go through the details that we have of the event of President Donald Trump being shot."
"As far as my opinion I believe the man has enough common sense to realize that this is a source of income, it's a source of bargaining in the world."
Let's see.
"Because I don't think they've been enough for election security, even here in my own county, Fulton County, even though we're run by the Republicans."
They had a seven point polling lead for Trump going into the switch and now it's down.
Four years coming from Connecticut supported a 55 year old or a Medicare buy in or dropping it to 55.
"But at that part of the conversation, I know he referred to someone else."
We are going to leave it there.
Do you think that somebody planned it?
"According to our partners at Decision Desk headquarters, Vice President Harris has a slight lead over Trump with 49.2%, Trump is at 48.1%."
It's incredible.
I think it showed DeSantis up about 7 percent among Hispanic voters and also 50 percent of them saying that they liked his policy of shipping migrants to Martha's Vineyards.
Trump's case in New York is falling apart.
"Early voting, of course, underway."
Carmen Russell Sluchansky with our partners at WHYY in Philadelphia takes a look at the debate over Shapiro's position on Israel.
And there's a couple of different perspectives about what took place in Pennsylvania.
The very long walk from the parking lots to the rally site.
We're taking it back.
"Maricopa County is the second largest, but we do it in so many different ways, local laws, statutes, local kind of the way the government is set up, and it's really, really robust, and we've actually never been more secure, more accountable, more transparent than we are now because of the way we've had to combat the misdissent malinformation that have been flooding the zone and really causing a lot of the problems that you've been talking about."
"I mean, we're talking about electing someone who has access to the nuclear codes and given his age will probably deteriorate further, maybe day by day and certainly year by year."
So we're going to go the other way.
This is a remarkable 15-point swing since April.
They'll do it.
What do you think is happening in Pennsylvania?
So I'd encourage people to hold him accountable.
"But on top of that, we have good news out of Marist of all pollsters."
"Uh, you've got this Clark County."
Maybe they think orange man bad.
You know we win Pennsylvania.
"The old saying, I think James Carville gets credit for it, but if you look at the red and the blue on the map, Pennsylvania is basically Philadelphia in the east, Pittsburgh in the west, and Alabama in the middle, because it's so red."
"Based on prior elections, we can estimate that between 70% and 80% of votes will be counted on election night, which is probably not enough in a tight race like this to know who won the state."
"Listen, nobody deserves to lose their life at all right now."
"Danielle Miller reporting for us live in Phoenix, Arizona as election 2020 continues to roll on there as President Trump supporters continuing to wait for more results in Arizona to see if they can indeed flip it back to read there and really change up the race there and the vote count electoral count that we are seeing right here at 264 to 214 right now in favor of Joe Biden."
"So in Allegheny County, the Democrats actually losing a percentage of the registered voters into that county."
"I am going to be and you may well be there to Sean, because I know you spoke and did so fabulously well at one of the most recent Trump rallies."
"And former President Trump, you're right."
"Now that we are digging deeper and excavating, we're starting to change our mind and say that it is possible."
"And it shows why getting people engaged, especially those who haven't felt heard or represented is so important."
Trump is higher than ever.
I'm excited that he's working with Trump.
And it's sad because it shouldn't be happening.
It certainly increases his visibility as a national player in both American politics and in Democratic politics.
"Okay, Congressman Chris Deluzio, thank you so much for the conversation, sir."

It sounds racist as hell to me but this is Kamala.
It was Clinton plus six.
"That statement by the former president, that one and the one preceding it, should be categorically condemned."
"You're already seeing Republicans, you know, resurface those concerns after Governor Walz was announced, as Vice President Harris was running mate last night."
"Harris's team, however, is outspending Trump."
"In 2020, Biden's focus on expanding health care access and addressing the opiate crisis helped him make some inroads with voters in the state, but Trump's strong support among working-class voters ultimately carried him to victory."
 I know where the United States belongs.
"Now, there are some circumstances where, you know, it's better later on the cycle or earlier, but most of the time, August is the best polling for Democrats virtually every single cycle, not just for the presidency, but for House races, for the Senate, for governorships."
"If Donald Trump wins this state, it is likely game over."
You didn't think it was gonna happen right now.
"Red Eagle, out."
"And she certainly and the Biden administration, to be fair, has kept the Trump tariffs in place and even doubled down on some of them."
That's praetoritism.
"But, as with any election, early voting isn't the final word."
Josh Appearo can make that sale.
They tend to be microcosms of the state.
And the truth is out there.
I'm not doing this for myself.
Oh my.
We told you.
We don't know because the as the audit it demonstrates very clearly Mr. Raskin.
We are going to make America great again.
Yeah you make really good points and that is exactly what's happening here is that everybody thought on election night that Arizona would very quickly get the results up and there wouldn't be much dispute about it because they were actually able to start calculating tabulating those ballots mail-in ballots and early ballots about two weeks ago.
I don't know why this car keeps waiting here.
So I just took I took his hand and hugged him.
The blue mirage was Democrat Joe Biden's huge 11-point lead over Republican Donald Trump after the first batch of early ballots were counted.
So here's another I want you to listen to the sound bite.
Honestly because Donald Trump told me to.
"And so for anybody who's like, oh, no, no, no, Kamala Harris is going to win these swing states."
Are there sort of votes being left on the table if they don't go out and get these voters?
I've had people criticize Donald Trump.
"Yes, his shares for Shapiro were trading at 68 cents Monday during morning hours in New York indicating the market sees a 68% chance he will be the Democratic nominee for vice president."
Because that seems like something the Democrats are good at.
Is that right?
I've been told that my magnetic antics make my artwork disgusting to look at.
An ex Arizona lawmaker who was allegedly photographed on the steps of the US Capitol during the January 6th riots as he and his wife are now involved in Arizona's audit of the 2020 election.
"Now, I would argue that that's a little bit high."
"And that really speaks volumes, even though Donald Trump was getting outspent in the primary in a lot of places."
"She now has in a Midwestern governor who's popular in his state, who has a track record to run on from Congress, who's a veteran, a high school social studies teacher, a football coach, has a story to tell that is very, very different when compared in juxtaposed with that of J.D."
"Like that shit really pissed a lot of people off, man, because you guys have already been taking us for granted anyway."
And now this.
"It may not have the best explanation, but it's offering things in very sharp contrasting language."
Back to Trump for a second.
"I mean, in the rate of inflation, the rate of price increases has certainly moderated."
"And we have Kamala Harris telling farmers in 2019 that if they're, you know, they heard new climate policies affecting, remember, they're coming after high yield agriculture."
And they're really being able to beat some of these early concerns that we heard from Democrats and within the party that they had this slow start to the campaign.
"Just making it clear as day, spelling it out for all the stupid, stupid other members of Congress who don't get it, even though it's so clear to him what happened."
"Yeah, Israel seems certain to pass."
Who could get elected with this stuff?
"But the fact is, Trump is a known commodity."
"If you win it, you're basically guaranteed the presidency."
"Whereas Harris, she could win every other state yet losing the scenario."
"So when we talk about it, Governor Shapiro out campaigning for the vice president today, there's Shapiro as we know, he's on the short list to become her running mate."
"Washington Post reports this quote, the six-month GOP driven review confirmed the accuracy of the results according to a report released last month, but that hasn't silenced Trump who continues to make false claims or those of other Republicans including several Arizona lawmakers on the House Committee."
"Now the details on that, they didn't have any of the specifics on when or where this might be, but just that this is in the works."
"On the South side, you have the mainline, old school, traditional."
"On this map, it will be the last probably state."
"People ask me, we love Trump."
And that has to stop.
Part of that is what people choose to accept.
This creates a fierce competition between the candidates as they seek support from both of these voter groups.
"On Fox News, he largely focused on immigration and the border."
"I remember sitting there and thinking, who does that?"
"Now, Kelly Ward was reelected as the state party chair this weekend, narrowly, but the folks she beat were also pretty hardcore Donald Trump supporters."
There were photos circulating on True Social of the massive crowd outside the farm show here in Harrisburg.
We'll have a contest.
But we're going to get to that.
That's where Penn State is.
"No, she hasn't been impressive in three years And she does seem to have trouble with speaking Extemporaneously, right?"
So how would you assess how the vice president is doing with three weeks to go.
"And I said, RFK Jr. says that if Donald Trump wins, he wins."
How would that affect your timeline for thinking about your political future?
"Can Harris replicate that margin in Montgomery, Chester, Bucks and Delaware?"
He said Democrats complaints a reflection of their anxiety over a tight race.
It shouldn't just be due to um misuse of our Female and male body parts.
And we're going to punish the companies that are shipping American jobs overseas.
And I have friends.
And ideally we could just say Donald Trump has taken the average right now.
They don't seem to know what what their message should be.
"But, but kiddo, I want you to just take a look, OK?"
That's exactly what Josh Shapiro and I did in our campaign for governor and lieutenant governor.
"Because those fantasies about how Biden will come back into the race, like I don't know if you saw those Anna when you were away, but he kept talking about like Biden could come back."
Is it the policies or the person you don't like?
"That's why it's a big deal that he's tied to the RCP average, which is a tie because screw Bloomberg for having this garbage Harris plus five."
Oh You know the internet is abuzz our number two the best This is gonna be a big hour because some of you are on the roads and for some of you It's gonna become a bit of a nightmare.
The back to back errors in 2016 and 2020.

"I understand that you don't like Trump, but I seen people even making comments talking about they wish that it got done."
"I don't know, but they certainly blame the current administration."
All of this chaos that we're seeing in the world right now can be laid right at the feet of the Harris Biden administration.
"And when we fight, we win."
Don't just read the headlines.
I don't think you got 55 percent of Catholics in Pennsylvania.

"And this 13 DNC again, we just saw one from his 13 DNC and we heard the audio, but look at this year, hell to the chef."
"So we've talked about those early polls, but it sounds like we shouldn't read too much into them just yet."
How's that fly in Pennsylvania?
"Hey man, you got to be careful about this."
Because we could use a reboot.
"And so when he ran for president the first time, he said he would support punishing women who got an abortion, punishing women."
So that was probably the most damaging thing that came out of that for people who generally just voted in presidential elections.
And it says Trump that bitch?
"Shapiro for his part says he's grateful to have had the opportunity to speak with Harris about her vision for the campaign ahead, but is excited to continue working to deliver results for Pennsylvanians as governor."
"The Democrats are down 416,000 mail-in ballot requests from where they were four years ago at the same time."

"We're at the Rawhide Event Center, Bianca Bono, 12 News."

She's a weird person.
"So it's absolutely massive news, even if it's like a small number in terms of the overall numbers, right?"
Go to joe Biden.com.
How do you think they're going to vote?
"Well, for starters, if you get rid of one poll, either the Bloomberg poll or the Quinnipiac poll, just one of the two, it would go from Harris plus point five to probably Trump plus one, because both of these polls are clear outliers."
They look delicious.
I wouldn't take anything for granted but I'm feeling optimistic.
"They keep invoking John McCain and a state where people were judged and judged policies and made decisions, didn't vote blindly for anyone."

"While Harris's platform addresses the need for comprehensive immigration reform and public health initiatives.as the election approaches, both campaigns will need to tailor their strategies to appeal to Arizona's diverse electorate."

They are barely above 59%.
"I think a lot of people were very excited to see the Arizona help push Joe Biden over, but Arizona is not a blue state."

"In May of 22, a year after our energy independence moved overseas, one of our fuel receipts totaled $996 for 166 gallons of fuel."

I noticed a very fascinating trend.
But let's just look.
They are driving both chaos at the same time where they are selling order.
"It was very contentious, but it was a state that Republicans had focused on."
"In Arizona, Biden's lead has narrowed slightly in recent days."
So I think that's actually that's a message that resonates.
"And even they are saying, it didn't matter one way or another."
They're literally being told that Harris has to win because Donald Trump is going to take away their democracy or abortion rights.
"If he could merely stick to a teleprompter for 60 plus days, he could win the whole thing."
But what's driving the early voting surge in Pennsylvania?
Pretty consistent if you ask me.
"WR's Noah Klein is here now with where she is set to speak and when, Noah."

"Yeah, things he has said bother me."
"With favorable polling data in key battleground states and a strong legal foundation, Trump's campaign is positioned to make a significant impact on the outcome of the election."
I'd be considered a supporter and I'm worried in regards to what the polling is suggesting to put up around black men.

What is the feeling now about the best course of action?
"The energy surrounding Harris and Walz's visit was palpable, underscoring the high stakes of the upcoming election."
"I mean, you know, Republicans first predicted that Donald Trump would win, then that the Supreme Court was going to intervene on his behalf, then that Biden would last 10 days."
"For more on our latest polling, I want to bring in CBS News executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto."

You've got some of the Steelers players now.
"Trump this weekend stepping up his anti-immigrant rhetoric and suggesting he might use the military against, quote, radical left lunatics on Election Day."
So there's no.
Well that remains to be seen as you know Nora but certainly a very spirited conversation among these voters as they watch tonight's debate but clearly not all of their answers were not all of their questions were answered tonight so that is why I know that they should hear more.
I would like to direct you to our next meeting.
Just to go back to the election there.

Like it's this it's a huge thing for Republicans and it is very good.
He's done so much for our country and he's going to make an extraordinary Vice President of the United States.
"I think she's it's gonna be a hopefully not a tie, but I think it's gonna be close race."
So we'll see what happens in terms of that.
Can you hook us up?
 Harris likely to pick Pennsylvania Gov.
"I don't think no, it hasn't."
It's about 48% to 47%.
And the ability of each candidate to sway the remaining undecided voters in these pivotal states.
"We've tried to reach out to a lot of tribal Americans, a lot of Native Americans."
"So really at this point, Harris cannot lose any more states."
They're all represented now.

He said that she never called or came to visit after any other hurricanes in the last three and a half years.

"And he goes, yeah, I love him."
"The electoral landscape of Pennsylvania is of paramount importance for any presidential candidate, particularly for Kamala Harris, as it has historically served as a bellwether state that can decisively influence the overall outcome of elections."

"But Quinnipiac, they're known for push polls."
But shouldn't the state's prosecutor have at least a passing interest in such a blatant scheme carried out right under his nose?

You have got to send him back to the United States Senate for the time that I was in the United States Senate and worked with Bob.
"Recent polls show that not just black men and black voters, but even Latin Americans are pivoting towards Donald Trump over Kamala Harris."
So we know what we are about.
But you know what I mean?
"Camara Bartolotta, a state senator who represents Washington County, Pennsylvania, which includes the town of Charleroi, became concerned about the lies being told about the immigrant community."
Trends are working against Democrats in many parts of the state.
"Well, from one end of the state to the other, KDK and our sister station CBS News Philadelphia are teaming up today to listen to you and take the pulse of Pennsylvania voters."
"They can cause people, compel people, persuade people to do things, to act."
"It's like, well, whatever happens in Somerset, you can multiply that to 57 because there's 57 other small counties all across Pennsylvania that's gonna have the similar kinds of thing."
"And these numbers, by the way, they're actually out of date a little bit."
That's always going to happen.
"It is me, Real American, back again with a new video, and today, we have to talk about the 2024 presidential election, because brand new data suggests that Donald Trump's on pace for victory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania."
Will he count the votes for the Democratic candidate that won or will he not?
But you know why?
And they very rarely agree with each other.
Wow!
"Philadelphia, what are they going to do?"
And there's no true test and courage under fire.
And so that's obviously kind of signals where the party is moving.
"He's showing strength there with white working class voters, with older voters, with black men, with the Hispanics suburbs around Philly."
I've never heard of any such thing.
We know it's bogus.
"And I know he's got a lot of children and we all want a better future for our children, correct?"

He's up in Arizona.
"Yes, they're both in good shape."
"And I believe that she could very well lose the state by two to three points when it's all said and done, depending on how things go over the next 35 days."
So 58% are not approving of Snippy Joe.
"Professor Sprinson says it's fitting that Pennsylvania is a battleground state, representing many of the political divides and splits seen nationally."
There's I think 50 or 60 pallets of them.
So let's take a quick look at some trends from the past few months.
But one thing is for sure Pennsylvania is shaping up to be one of the most critical battlegrounds in the 2024 election.
They had Hillary Clinton winning it by six points.
"Likewise, another contract that asks if Trump will win every swing state is down 4 percentage points in the last week and 35 percentage points in the last month since Biden's gaffered in performance debating Trump."
CBS News estimates that both states will likely go to Biden.
"That it's a kind of double edged sword to caramelize not giving herself the opportunity to make mistakes, but at the same time, it kind of cuts off access to who she is."
"In order for people to feel, in order for Democrats to feel comfortable about Bob Casey Jr. beating McCormick in the Pennsylvania Senate race, Democrats need to have banked around 335,000 votes."
There are seven states.
And I don't know how you feel.
But I want to hear what you guys have to say.
"If Donald Trump is elected, that 60 percent across the board of tariffs, or even worse, can put them out of business."
"It opens up so many pathways that are just simple, much more easier than, oh yeah, you're down for sure in."
"That's why I am committed to passing a Green New Deal, creating clean jobs, and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all."
"On the other hand, Trump is doubling down on his promise to bring back manufacturing jobs to Pennsylvania."
I apologize if I wasn't clear.
"Andrew, Ryan, both of you know who you're voting for, but a lot of your fellow students are still undecided."
"Pennsylvania's diverse electorate, combined with its recent history of flipping between parties, makes it a crucial state for both Harris and Trump."
"You're talking about 2.2 million people where 100 percent are displaced, whether you're looking to the health ministry numbers or the Lancet Journal publication, the deaths are somewhere between 40,000 and 180,000, the majority of which are women and children, and 90 percent of civilian infrastructure has been decimated."
"Number one, a lot of that's part time crap that people have to get because of how bad inflation is because of this administration."
"John was conservative, to put it mildly."
He's up in Pennsylvania.
"And he's engaged in some really bizarre types of, uh, activities during this campaign."
"But after that, it became great."
That's what I got to tell you about that.
Is this the closing message they want and can it move the needle?
Here's the abortion issue.
We don't like that.
Donald Trump sees power as nothing more than a means to his ends.
I think it's I think it's a very uncontroversial statement to say that only 26 percent of CNN viewers think the Republican Party is the biggest enemy facing America.
Pennsylvania is the big win.
And they all say one thing.
It was tough and you can sense the closeness of this race by the intensity of that debate.
And I saw where the engines came down.
"Charlemagne, why did Obama single out black men?"
There's some Trump signs over there.
I'm Kristen Smith.
Turns out the oil field was the perfect fit for me.
And that is there will be no deal.
"You could see a Harris victory, a Trump victory helping one or either of these candidates, or maybe people are gonna split their tickets."
Get these people out there.
But here's the thing about this.
"Now Dana Bash's credit, what she just asked her there was, well, you said that your values have not changed."
I find that fascinating.
"Despite all the dooming surrounding Pennsylvania, Trump is in a very good position to win it."
"He was down in Michigan, he was down in Wisconsin."
"In the edited version, she responds swiftly and is not seen to make that claim."
"Historically, they don't show up in mass like the older age groups."
Do you?
I'll tell you when.
Kamala Harris received 46% of the vote and Donald Trump 48%.
Thank you for all the clapping.
You're working hard to get Republicans over the line in this election.
These are deeply serious conditions that clearly impact her functioning.
And my opponent said nothing about that.
"And we've, we've been clear and said again today that U.S. energy companies must bring, must keep bringing pump prices down by closing this historic, historically large gap between wholesale and retail gas prices."
"But, you know, the world is very different."
"I want to ask you about this far-right activist, this woman, Laura Loomer, who's been traveling with Donald Trump."
I'm U. K. Washington Aziza is off tonight.
You've called Joe Biden an illegitimate president.
"Of the tiny amount in swing states, Northampton County was the closest in 2020."
"Yeah, Japan."
But do I think you could see Trump win the state by like two to three?
"Five states remain now, let's start with our Midwestern duo of Ohio and Iowa, a duo because they have followed nearly identical trends as one another in recent years."
Horrifically honest.
Pecu.
"Welcome back, everyone."
"There were threats early on that were pretty generic in nature, but as days went on, they became a lot more specific, providing my address, graphic descriptions of what they would do to my family."
"Democrats are the ones working on housing policy to make sure these kids have a safe roof over their head, addressing violence in their community, gun violence in particular in their schools and their neighborhoods."
"So too, I mean, remember at the DNC, he spoke first instead of speaking his ass and then he left."
He also said a lot of other things that you would expect.
"And on more than one occasion throughout all this, that has been brought up and it is a tenet of my faith."
Let's think about what has been happening in the south where even moderate flooding can overwhelm sewage systems and contaminate drinking water.
The country's unsafe.
Because that matters.
"So even this, if these 10,000 were to be thrown out, these could be deciding votes, especially because if they're on net votes, like if you guys remember back in 2020, I remember, you know, trying to explain to people even after it looked like the red mirage was happening on the night of election, right?"
What does that tell you?
"I think part of the challenge with contacting Latino voters is that neither of the parties historically had been well prepared to connect with Latino voters, not a ton of Latino volunteers, not a ton of Spanish speakers."
That's what he said.
"It actually started up I think Mary Trump kind of helped start that kind of trend now It's a Mary and I think someone else and then you know a bunch of you know There's a senator that came out of cameras to me and you know, there's an Arizona, you know camera froze a mayor or you know, then you have like I think Gonzalez the AG former AG just came out too."
It's never going to happen when they are on the ground in Pennsylvania.
"I tried my best to be a realist, but I also choose to have hope, which I think is not something that a lot of people have, which is hard."
"McGarvey said, and again, you've got President Biden talking about hope."
But she's run a fairly flawless campaign so far and still isn't budging.
I just can't do that.
"You and I have had this discussion many, many times."
"He re-ups some polls that have been done in battleground states, not necessarily Pennsylvania, but other states."
Now earlier today we stopped in Upper Marion Township.
"If somebody says, Well, I'm thinking about voting for Trump because I remember the economy being pretty good."
"Democratic senator, it happens on occasion, but I'm not expecting Casey to lose."
There's a lot of other parts in Pennsylvania.
"He has pleaded not guilty, with his defense expected to argue that his actions were influenced by struggles with substance abuse."
"That's pretty much all the Democrats when they're in control of states, they try and make the voting laws extremely lax."
And we don't see any of that.
So we're going to wait a while.
He is okay.
Former President Trump returned to Pennsylvania for the first time since the attempted assassination of him in western Pennsylvania a few weeks earlier.
Will you give them to me?
I'm not that.
10% of the total votes came from just this tiny little area here and that's Philadelphia.
That's why it's not good for Democrats that they're way behind where they should be.
I wonder if the Trump campaign has responded to the vice president's use of his own words at her rallies to rally voters to her cause.
"If she can tap into the concerns of suburban voters, she may significantly enhance her chances of securing a win in Pennsylvania."
"And I think a lot of our grandparents are just saying, could we get a little bit of help?"
"These urban areas have traditionally been Democratic strongholds, but the state's rural and small-town voters have increasingly turned to the Republican party in recent years' point one of the key factors driving Ohio's shift toward the Republicans has been the realignment of working-class white voters."
"There's there's about 50 percent are Democrats, about 25 percent are Republicans, and then 25 percent are independent, at least here in Pennsylvania."
And they got everything completely wrong.
"The campaign and the White House have really tried to remind voters what the country was like in 2020, the raging pandemic, job losses."
"We talked about the election polls, and we talked about emergency prep."
We knew that was going to come.
"President Biden going after Facebook, saying that they're killing people."
"I mean, I've seen him when the cameras are on and when they're off."
That was the word I was thinking of Jodie transitory.
"Joining us now is Caitlin Becker, who is live in Bucks County."
He's leading in them.
"The seventh poll was conducted between September 20 and 24 by Beacon Research, Shaw and Company Research among 1,021 registered voters."
So let's look at some of the possibilities for her.
To lower health care costs.
Trumpy Trout will make you feel so good.
Well today in these blue wall states Vice President Harris is really going after that narrow sliver of those undecided voters specifically suburban women those more moderate Republicans and independents they're really hoping that former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney is going to make a dent with some of those voters who may be unsure about Vice President Kamala Harris but are also frustrated and tired of Donald Trump and Harris's message to them is that they've got a home within the Democratic Party and Liz Cheney is making the pitch that it's because she's deeply conservative that she's backing Harris she says she's putting the Constitution over her party calling Donald Trump unchecked unstable and dangerous.
"He is us, and we are him."
Didn't comment about complaints about Lew.
It is the first time the US President has appeared with his Vice President on the election trail since dropping out of the race.
"Please support us by subscribing to our channel, liking this video, and sharing it with your friends to show support for Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign."
You read stories like this all the time about people who believe this.
Are y'all ready to address white and white crime?
"And I think that's also why Kelly Ward, who's the current chairwoman of the Arizona Republican party, I think she said it best last week at the rally as she introduced Donald Trump."
Transitor.
That's good.
And we think she'll be a great president.
Kerry Lake can win by about one.
"So therefore his campaign has always been targeted to specifying particular areas, particular counties in crucial states and focusing their efforts on there."
And she's offering her own set of proposals and vision for the country.
I wanted to finish here.
"Of the electorate in the midterms, but this is a presidential year."
The problem is we're losing union jobs.
Give me one reason you believe that.
And you guys did do a great job of keeping them on task and on track.
Even some traditionally liberal groups are seeing closer races than they expected.
Trump's path to victory also runs through the Keystone State.
I started off on the other side of the farm complex.
So we're going to we're going to retain them.
But everybody else actually gets something for their vote.
"So I feel this is for him to come back here, another act of defiance."
"Be well, be kind."
There are some like CBS News that have not yet called or projected a winner there in that state.
So to this two percent is huge This one has a zero so some of these polls have and this is another one that has West at two percent the bull Finch group these ones have some pretty crazy polls going on right now for for Kamala Harris And so they have West here at two some of the other ones have zeros This one has one so he's definitely pulling at some numbers in some of these polls for sure and a lot of them He's not included and then in others he's getting zero like in this one and some of the other ones But zero might also be rounded down.
Tim Walz will be ready on day one.
Very sad but also it looks like we're coming to an end with this.
The sample size is 1331.
Niggas is missing now what what the fuck going on?
And a pandemic.
"This pink knit scarf, this beautiful item, made in China."
There were four pillars.
"One issue, if you could nail down one issue that matters to you the most, reproductive rights, climate change, the economy, being pro-life."
Certainly you would like to take it because that would be a swing of 12 cause Harris would be losing the six and Nevada and Trump would be gaining them.
"I mean, like 50 bucks for a pack of diapers is wild."
You just can't.
"It shows you how many articles there are, but the coverage is only 10 percent on the left."
"Good evening, Pennsylvania."
And you'll see him again and again.
"Now Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has notably withdrawn from the Maine ballots, which does mean that we're unlikely to get to rank choice voting here this November."
"Now, a lot of you know a little bit about my story."
"Meanwhile, a New York Times-Siana poll now shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in three key battleground states."
50% is exactly where you want to be if you're not beyond 50% when you're looking at a lead in any type of poll.
And this is almost a point here that would go for Trump.
"Hit subscribe, let's get to three million subscribers together, thank you so much for watching."
Do you really think a 500 K advantage for Harris means a victory?
"Kind of in the middle of the state, more or less."
"You people are asking, a number of people are asking, why go ahead with this to the Democrats when the prospects look so dim?"
"For all our viewers asking where One America News is heading in the future, we would like to introduce you to OAN Live."
Could you make it easier to afford the things that I need to buy rather than harder?
So Arizona will be crucial on election day.
And Trump is up big in the polls in Georgia.
"I mean, in recent elections, we have seen people turn out and vote with abortion on their minds, and that has very much benefited Democrats."
"Months after the work was done, my daughter's blood work improved, the frequency of our headaches began to decrease, and my dad's breathing had improved."
Where the guy's not charged?
I set before you today as a Republican who was voted into office in November of 2020.
"Fellow Americans of mine, please don't forget we have a big election coming up on November the 5th, so if you are eligible to vote, if you are intending to vote, if it's possible for you to vote, please double-check your voter registration before election day, and if you can do more than vote, by all means please do more, but at the very least on November the 5th."
"Oh, I want to talk about IVF."
"You said, what if Biden was in a rally like that?"
"I'm not saying that, but I find it fascinating that every poll is showing Trump doing at the bare minimum three points better in Pennsylvania."
Stick around.
What is all people of the Internet?
What do you do when you're a presidential candidate and your withering attacks on a marginalized group in a struggling small town aren't paying off like you hoped they would?
But we'll see what happens.
"If the final numbers on approval rating in the exit polls are like even, I mean, it's, it's, she's not winning like that."
61%.
Concrete plans to lower health care costs.
That's part of it.
"Edward Isaac Dovery is reporting that North America's building trades union voted today to endorse Biden much earlier than usual and with plans to spend eight figures on mobilizing its 250,000 members in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, they credit President Biden's work with infrastructure."
They're saying we've got record job growth.
Listen to what they told me.
The third poll was conducted between September 14th and 15 by Insider Advantage among 800 likely voters.
"OK, yeah, compared to 2020, even 2022."
"You know, trillions of dollars wasted, thousands of Americans dead, tens of thousands wounded, hundreds of thousands with the invisible wounds of war."
"And this is one of the only issues where there is some disagreement among Democrats on how to do... On most policies, Democratic Party is in a lot of the same places."
So Trump has got to be feeling pretty good right now.
I spoke with some young voters today at UNC Greensboro.
The most recent poll for the New York Times shows Harris is closing in on Donald Trump in a number of swing states.
I don't even know that we've seen that before.
"And it's an area where you got to compete really, really hard."
"And that, keeping that trend going, is the formula for statewide success in Pennsylvania."
"Now, she's only doing these softball interviews."
"If people lose faith in that, that's going to dramatically impact our democracy."
"Whenever the campaign is here, there is a focus on speaking with Latino voters in part because when you visit Allentown, you are visiting a Latino city."
I know I don't think it was since 2016 that Republicans haven't won here in Pennsylvania a key swing state What do they have to do differently this time around to win?
It's things like crime.
"And if for anybody that was around 10 years ago in the state of Arizona, you had said Jan Brewer would be calling, another wing of the party extreme, it's telling you something."
You had to get wanted.
But Santa Claus is real.
You know that better than anybody.
I really try not to think about the future in politics.
"I'm a Christian, a wife, a mother of three, and a small business owner in that particular order."
"So it's very, very expensive."
He just did.
"And we've also seen Donald Trump be indicted on various federal crimes, not limited to sexually assaulting, being found liable for sexually assaulting E. Jean Carroll in a New York City dressing room in 1994."
"Yeah, good morning, Savannah."
"So even if you can pick off a voter here and there, you know, it makes a difference."
"Yeah, and again, I think there's a problem, like there's a disconnect."
And so that kind of tipped the balance enough where Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania.
And actually Clinton under Biden under performed Clinton in this county as well.
Well what is swatting?
They want to control what women can and can't do to their bodies.
So follow me on those platforms as well.
"My question to you is, what's your stance on reparations?"
"They don't want to talk about continuing the tax cuts for the billionaires, the wealthiest people in the world and the biggest corporations in the world, because they know that if they talk about that stuff, they're going to lose a lot of votes."
But he said that Joe Biden has been on the wrong side of American foreign policy for the last 50 years.
"First of all, let me ask you, because you've been following us closely, do you see any scenario in the next 22 days where that issue is resolved before Election Day?"
He mentioned that perhaps he should revoke CBS broadcasting license.
It's going to be difficult if she continues with who she's been up until this point.
They are just wonderful.
I didn't know he'd go this far This is surprising.
"I paint just for, you know, kind of fun."
And that was Governor Tim Walz in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
"So it's not like Quinnipiac is really the strongest pollster, especially in the Rust Belt."
They think it's OK.
This is the stuff you read about in history books never did I ever think in my lifetime that would happen in real time let alone read it on twitter sitting in a driveway.
You said tatju?
Love this video?
Several shots were heard.
"But then like a lot of beeps, beep, beep, beep, was a thumbs up with a positive."
We'll put the links to the bulwark right here on the screen and also in the post description of this video.
And it turned out she was available and wanted to do it.
Thank you for clarifying that.
We're going to make our country get this is going to be I want this to be a really important evening.
Other people have their own opinions on it.
"Another subject that the governor addressed was freedom, which is a theme that is regularly brought up in Republican speech and is frequently a key component of conversation."
"I mean, 60%."
"And keeping our incredible veteran agents on the force, don't leave us."
Florida comes next.
I think she's she's running good.
Illinois is a reliably Democratic state voting for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since 1992.
Thank you very much
"The company has said that this year till date, it has managed to fall 20 such attempts, including a set of chat GPT accounts in August that were used to produce articles on topics that included the 2024 US elections."
"Both campaigns will likely pour significant resources into the state, knowing that its 20 electoral votes could be the deciding factor in the race to 270."
"Well, certainly make sure that you have a thick skin."
"And to help her do it, she needs a Senate full of public servants like Reuben Ganeagle."
"From the biggest of cities to the smallest of rural communities, I've met with people from all walks of life and all backgrounds and that's one thing that we all agree upon, that clean water is essential."
She quit after two weeks.
And then you have articles sounding the alarm.
Do you remember that?
She needs to.
"You have a chance to vote yes on Prop 139 and put women, not politicians, back in control of their personal medical decisions."
Kamala Harris received 47 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 48 percent.
"But the margin may be smaller, if that makes sense."
My mother raised my sister and me she worked very hard again with this.
By the way get out there and vote.
But there's a long way to go.
We need support over here and we're not really getting any.
It showed that there's a certain love of a country when they do that.
And it was talked about using the military even before taking office again if he were to.
Y'all here to have a little bit of fun?
"Speaking to Sean Parnell, combat veteran host of the Battleground Live podcast on the Clay and Buck Network."
"Look, I'm from western Pennsylvania."
And we do hear him walk on that message a little bit sometimes.
But but it also decapitates both of them.
As Newsom did.
The idea of intentionally trying to deceive people in their most desperate and vulnerable moments.
"There are 90,000 Amish in Pennsylvania."
"During that conversation, did, you asked Mr. Giuliani for proof of these allegations of fraud that he was making?"
I need that hat.
So recapping real quick in Pennsylvania Harris up six points on Trump in Michigan.
So this could be a down ballot situation.
"Catherine Scott Channel 6 Action News, Matt."
"Thank you for joining us Thank you, thank you, that's really that's actually true you really can't you can't split physical health and Mental health so it's thank you."
"And if you look at, let's just look at Michigan, for example."
"If Harris wins Pennsylvania, her path to the White House becomes much clearer."
"He's been someone who was told the New York Times that the whole thing has been very silly, that these cyber ninjas don't know what they're doing, and that, frankly, he's embarrassed by what he's seeing unfold in Arizona."
"It's about helping people not just get by, but get ahead, making sure that there's a conversation around housing policy and building more housing and making sure that the issues that resonate with all voters are the issues that they talk about with our voters here in Allentown."
"Well, maybe he's had more pertinent information."
"The latest poll here in Georgia from a polling company called Focal Group does still have Trump leading by 4 points over Harris, 52% to 48% among 651 likely voters."
"Ace, have a great day to all Republicans and Democrats and independents."
But these are the numbers that we're going to be following.
This is a political liability for Republicans and specifically for Donald Trump.
So what does this mean?
No Trump presence or endorsement.
He's just freaking hilarious.
The 12th poll was conducted between September 19 and 25 by Morning Consult with 993 registered voters.
"And there is a concern privately among some Democrats that Vice President Harris, her support among some some union members could be a little bit soft."
So Gary who's with you and what are they saying about the speech?
But I also want to note that Minnesota has a history of producing Democratic vice presidents.
That's a murder.
We give up maybe to go back and forth.
We're seeing Trump doing it and we're seeing the Harris-Wallis campaign doing this work.
"Maybe they're comparing it to 2016, but Hillary lost it in 2016 in Pennsylvania."
"Definitely not the liberals of yesteryear, my goodness."
"Remember, John Dickerson sat down with Bob Woodward, who's releasing audio tapes of conversations with the former president."
"As for the Republican leader, his campaign fund currently stands at a measly three hundred and eight million dollars in comparison with Kamala Harris's war chest, which is way far behind his political rival."
"There are reports suggesting Trump worked at him at Donald's, but that's not quite right because there's differences between work and stage theatrics."
So Harris is expected to make remarks here around 650 in Greensboro.
There was blood pouring everywhere.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I think a lot of people are trying to answer this question.
"They wanted to see, OK, what's happening in Pennsylvania when it comes to voter registration."
"This is the level of spirit mic is stronger now than it's ever been, Rick, would you say?"
" This is Teagram for The Real News Network in Baltimore City, Maryland."
"What's at stake, the road ahead."
Oh my God.
"And folks, the trends are overwhelming pro democracy and rejecting the madness, rejecting the chaos, rejecting the meanness, rejecting the wannabe fascism, rejecting the attack on our democracy, rejecting the loserness, the weirdness, all of that that Donald Trump represents and supporting on the other hand, President Biden and the pro democracy movement, normalcy, democracy, our Constitution, actually delivering things, policies."
"All right, so use the proper labels."
Nor now.
And that's why we are urging with all the power that we have.
Because they said that Donald Trump opened things up too quickly and he killed people because of it.
She's a strong candidate.
He was a veteran.
"And yeah, more than all, share the video."
"And I don't even think Harris is really that strong of a candidate when it comes to these like, you know, millennial men, for example, which, you know, typically when they grow up as well, they're going to be, you could argue, moving to the right."
So just not now.
"Well, why are you actively trying to make it harder to pass legislation that prevents that potential voter fraud?"
You have a very good governor.
Was a slate of fake electors anywhere on your list of things to think about?
"I mean, I know what we all know what they're going to ask questions."
If you're worried about losing the games because Steam will shut down forever.
"Well, you better than four years ago, 43%."
"Momma, Kamala, just don't give a frack."
"And I mean, it was crazy in the way that it was counted and all the ballot dumps like three or four IMS."
"The third poll was conducted between September 16th and 19th by Redfield and Wilton Strategies among 1,286 likely voters."
"No, I'm not making up this."
It's about our future.
They're saying those policies helped their families.
"She was actually interviewed by our local affiliate, KLAS in Las Vegas."
Order was a little bit better.
There's just no two ways around this.
"But he comes off as the Chuck's guy next door, you know, football coach."
What was life like four years ago?
"Now, in contrast, Donald Trump is managed to get just about 310 odd million dollars."
"I mean, you sent some fighters to D.C., Pennsylvania."
"We understand that right about in about an hour and a half, there's going to be another batch that comes out."
They couldn't believe it.
"Unfortunately, I'm going to keep standing up and doing my job defending our elections, defending the voters of Arizona and making sure that their will is upheld in our in our next election."
"I shared this with our Vice President during her 2022 visit, and it was so great hearing a passion and concern in her voice, speaking on how diligently she and the administration is working to make sure that all households achieve the goal of having access to clean drinking water and lead-free paint."
No one knew that I sang before.
Harris is at 51 percent unfavorable.
An astronaut and a fighter pilot.
"I'm Joey Mannequin, Patriot and in this video we're going to be discussing how Donald Trump is surging in the key state of Pennsylvania."
excited to be here.
You ultimately were fired by Fox.
That's ABC six.
That looks like that look like someone down right there in a red shirt.
The twelfth poll was conducted between September 19th and 25 by morning consult with 993 registered voters.
So we're going to talk about it.
He would not vote for Trump a third time.
But they decided to put Kamala Harris out there more and more.
"And it's causing, you know, these extreme actions."
"So if you get you know, you win early votes, but not by 70 points that it's only like 1.8 million votes or whatever."
"And with the addition of North Carolina, that's more than enough to win."
Congressman Vance also said Trump's attorney general pick will be more important than his VP pick if he is elected here.
"Yeah I mean it's what we've been saying now for quite some time that this comes down to Blue Wall, Blue Wall, Blue Wall."
Arizona is a border state.
Can we hear it from Madam City Clerk?
He was very nice.
"President Biden said, you see the photos right there."
"He said, well, we have heard by an official high-up in the Republican legislature that there is a legal theory or a legal ability in Arizona that you can remove the, the electors of President Biden and replace them."
"It's closing rapidly in Pennsylvania, where early voting numbers favor Democrats."
The New York Times reported this weekend that Donald Trump is kind of disoriented by this shift from Biden to Harris.
We've got an Atlantic Ocean separating us.
And that's why you saw the number change there.
"And the assumption was that was to avoid triggering the SEC's pay-to-play rule, which prevents you from giving to state officials."
There's just so much going on.
He's probably not going to lose a ridiculous amount of them from what we understand if they were able to stick with him twice in terms of the black voters.
And then we saw what happened when pushback from McConnell McCarthy and other so-called Republican leaders came in.
Trump's camp has said that a debate with Harris scheduled for Sept. 10 on ABC has been terminated with Biden's departure and instead proposed a debate a few days earlier on Republican friendly Fox News complete with a full arena audience.
It's an alarm.
That's the forecast right now.
"We want to lower immigration, illegal and legal."
"I know there's 5,600 of you in the room."
"Well Pittsburgh has effectively banned rodeos for more than three decades, but a provision inserted in this year's state budget requires municipalities to allow such events."
And Jake Rosen here with me in Studio 57 with the latest on the Trump campaign.
These are not people that were Democrats.
"I mean, it's run by a person who's a retard."
Pick one.
The flip side of it is how humiliating is it that Trump lost to a guy who didn't leave his basement?
Biden?
"Police are preparing for potential chaos as 100,000 demonstrators are expected to fill the streets, mirroring the turbulent protests of 1968."
"Now Ms. LeBlanc, this is an election that is being watched across the world, and one thing that I want you to weigh in on is the staggering disparity in the amount of funds that these two candidates seem to have raised."
"And I have a plan on lowering costs on everything from health care to groceries, including taking on corporate price gouging."
I'm going to go through this.
"Martha, I've said repeatedly, I think the 2020 election had problems."
The one X factor that has happened that we've seen a sizable electoral reverberance with is the Dobbs decision.
They're not necessarily pounding the national numbers as hard.
"It's like, oh, boy, right now, the 2024 absentee requests, they're more Republican than 2020 by roughly a point."
And it didn't matter that I was a Democrat.
It's not about the country.
Seven million viewers watched Kamala Harris on Fox News.
"But this is a race to watch, because DeSantis is a person to watch as a kind of rising star within the Republican Party."
Central PA. Show you all the Donald Trump stuff.
We're going to raise a little bit of money for you and in return you're going to tow the line.
You know now that fracking has worked as well as it has there was a point in time at least when Trump was president that we were energy independent.
I will not do it.
Joe Biden starts off at 214 points in this race.
That's all I could say about it.
We didn't have our phones.
"Not one of the leaders, you have all the leaders up here, you have all the leaders in the room."
Trump low prices.
And so that's what we got to look at.
And we're Donald Trump can't hold a candle to what we are doing every day because he is just full of empty promises that have quite literally raised costs for the middle class and made it harder for them to get ahead.
And I wasn't perfect right off the bat.
"But the argument that was made by the GOP was that, sure, Kamala Harris could re-inspire the Democratic base, but Trump would re-inspire the Republican base even more against Harris than Trump."
"One is that Vice President Harris has been very intentional from the start of this campaign to treat every single voting cohort with the respect they are due, meaning she does not take anyone for granted and she has worked hard to cultivate and curate policies that speak to their needs."
What is his lasting legacy?
"Urban centers like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are democratic strongholds, but the state's rural regions and smaller towns lean heavily Republican."
"I do think that Quinnipiac has a very streaky history of over inflating the Democratic candidates margin, at least with Biden in 2020 and Harrison 2016."
So thank you for joining my channel.
Just a quick update.
"Obama, Clinton, and Biden, the last three Democratic nominees, each get about 17 points."
I'm not going to bore you with the details of what that means and how we get it.
Too many communities have been left behind and are suffering from decentralized and inadequate wastewater systems and that's why President Biden and Vice President Harris have made investing in our nation's water infrastructure a cornerstone of this administration's agenda.
So we're not sure if any of these things are gonna move the metric really.
"Coming from a liberal standpoint, I think part of the concern is existential."
"On the other hand, Oz lost."
Vice president Harris has already broken down a major gender barrier and her career.
And a lot of stuff got kind of swept under the road quite literally.
And now Kathy Barnett is surging to the point where this race is neck and neck because she had a good debate performance and because people are totally dissatisfied with the other two choices.
And so go check it out and don't miss this one.
Only one man can fix that.
"Why don't we just take out the sensitive and put it in um, and then it'll be Trump property."
But in this final stretch we're seeing a lot of really interesting proposals that came as kind of a surprise to old guard Republicans.
"Now, later in the day today, the former American president Barack Obama is expected to rally for the Democrat presidential nominee."
"I think that he, quite honestly, as a psychologist, I think that he's a danger to democracy."
That's a terrifying moment despite the fact that Trump turns into Professor Freak at the end of that sentence.
We also have the red wave merch.
He just can't see them but you have all these balloons up here.
"We're gonna look up in terms of, I wanna show you what I'm saying right here."
"We're not know we're not crazy about Harris as the vice president Well, she wasn't impressive."
And therefore it's going to take a lot more time and obviously a lot more money for him.
And so it's going to be an unbelievable thing to see.
"But first, I have to tell you guys about our latest sponsor over at Ground News."
You will see this consistent trend of Donald Trump.
"So part of the strategy by Democrats is in a way reminding Latino voters of this policy that had taken place back when the former president was in office, controversial policy."
Jeeves!
"So even though the voter registration numbers might be lower and the state might be becoming more Republican as far as registration, the actual vote totals are still favoring the Democratic side."
"It turns out half of them are going to go for Biden, but Trump still leads the poll by three, which confirms what I'm saying that half of Haley supporters were never Republicans."
"So they're saying Biden is going, man, listen, listen, like I said, they are definitely blaming the Democratic Party on this one."
So what the Obama appearance is about is about driving turnout among some of those core democratic coalitions.
Now recently of course price increases have moderated considerably but as you know prices don't go back down typically and so people still are not accustomed to the sticker shock they get at the supermarket.
"Ms. Fifield, I really appreciate your time tonight."
"If you would like to become a member, go ahead and click the join button below this video to receive exclusive perks."
That's no real surprise.
But another time.
"And so it's fully appropriate, at least for presidents who do work or normal, that you'd want to have not a blanket executive privilege waiver, but something case by case."
"But beyond that point, it's it's crazy to see."
It flipped back to President Biden in 2020 and now it's up for grabs again.
And this is as she tries to court Republican voters from moderate Republicans to Republicans who have turned against former President Donald Trump.
I want to see taxes go down I want to see the economy better housing.
"That means reconciling their personal faith with some of Harris's positions, like on abortion."
"And of course, we know that a lot of our senior citizens, the ones who are living on a fixed income, are the ones who have been hit the hardest by Kamala Harris's inflation."
It's not just the Latinos latinx community that they're struggling with maybe because they keep calling them latinx.
But I think what you really need to see on an economic message is something that speaks to the middle class strengthens our union jobs and our unions in general.
And I think that was one of them.
"So that third party vote shares really capped them, which also makes sense why RFK Jr. backed out of the race and endorsed him because he kind of got his support gutted with this switch up on the Democratic side."
But a great starting point is this article by Jeremy Stahl.
Is that what motivates you to come back here?
Maybe they were Republicans.
"So there's a tremendous support here with the people coming in, regardless of the color cookie."
"All right, Robert Costa with a great segue because we have more to talk about with the economy in Pittsburgh force."
 You saw the polls over the weekend.
"A month ago, Harris was actually above water, as they say, 48 percent favorable and 45 percent negative a month ago."
Bush onto his ticket.
"I mean, people are just piling in already."
In my opinion?
They have made them less safe in their cities.
The state is going to vote in the coming weeks.
I hate to say this because I say it all the time.
"So it was a bit of a slow news day due to the Labor Day holiday, and I went through about a dozen new sites this morning looking for a few stories to put on your radar as you get back to work, and I came across just a couple."
And the next few weeks could very well determine the direction of the nation.
They have a Trump plus three.
 Right now Kamala Harris's weeks old presidential campaign got a massive jolt of energy from an electric rally Friday here in the valley.
Do you have a to uh to people in regard to register and I've had tell me that their one vo one vote will count.
"Joining us now White House reporter for Bloomberg, Akayla Gardner."
"So far, 52% of those are from registered Dems, 31% from registered Republicans, 17% other."
You can see it in his face right.
We are doing a special for a limited time.
Harris is going to represent a no vote against things that have been perceived has been going on for some time.
It can be misleading and maybe just maybe it's entirely possible that Pennsylvania polls actually understate Harris.
"For Joy, who lives in the same Philadelphia suburb, security and support of Israel are her priorities."
"According to New York Times' Siena College polls conducted from August 8 to 15, Harris and Trump each garnered an average of 48 percent support among likely voters across these states."
And this is the first time that I've ever seen a Trump surrogates.
Leading Harris 51% to 41% in terms of voter trust on this critical matter.
Talk to us a little bit more about what Biden had to say and what type of impact do you think it had?
And you're right about VEEP.
They were critical of the Obama administration.
"Look at the size of that advantage, right?"
Each campaign is rolling out different ideas on the daily.
"Usually their early polls have underestimated Trump significantly, but you look at the past three polls in the state of Pennsylvania."
You really care about me even though.
"Look, look, you can't use the word fucking, okay."
So Pennsylvania could hold the keys.
"Well, that's kind of the Republican party of the moment in microcosm, isn't it?"
"The recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling, which mandates that mail-in ballots be signed and dated, aligns with Trump's position on maintaining strict voting standards."
But Trump's going to have a lot of stuff on Harris and they're saving it.
"If a non-citizen tried to cast a ballot, would you be able to catch it?"
But a lot of women have told us by this three to one margin just about that they feel in general after the Roe v. Wade overturn access to women's reproductive health care more generally is getting harder.
"Look, I I want you to think of really what this election is about."
"It charged the entire political conversation in the country about whether relief should be sent to New Jersey, the scope of that relief."
And now you look at it.
Because she's not smart.
That is Donald Trump.
I don't want to mess.
"And I thank you, Gwen, for doing all that you have done."
"If you could give advice to anybody who's thinking about taking their son or daughter to a riot at the Capitol, what would it be?"
So the cost of beef went up 5 to 6%.
He was going to hand me any money.
"On October 2nd, Trump returned to Pennsylvania to hold two rallies in Scranton and Reading."
"Thank you so much for having me, though."
"Welcome to The Debrief, where we talk with the Washington examiners, top journalists about the headlines they're covering and where the story is going next."
And the only way we're going to do it is if we elect Donald J. Trump.
"Natalie Brand, CBS News, Ardmore, Pennsylvania."
"I mean, you look, you can have the opinion of rich folks and that's fine, but we all know how people that got money, we know like a lot of your white liberals, we got money."
"And I think that's kind of what pushed us to get so involved is that like the other side, Donald Trump's America is so scary to us."
"Their visit, coming just months before the 2024 election, highlighted the state's crucial role in determining the nation's future."
And today was day one.
It was phony.
You think they would practice for this stuff.
So that's good.
I can't even get it out.
There's actual a lack of unity on this subject.
The Democrat has also a slight lead in four of the seven swing states.
"But the electoral dust seems to be settling, and the race once again looks to be a tight one."
What do these jobs mean?
"Also, then I read a report that they bought a bunch of fuel back then at a big discount and saved a bunch of money."
"A former top aide to the governor, Mike Verb, was accused of sexual harassment by a female subordinate."
And he tells us what he would do if he is elected president.
And I think my message to folks who are undecided is very simple.
And that might be the pro of Dr. Oz.
Look at this line.
We have four years of Biden and can compare that to four years of Trump and voters can render their judgment based on that.
"So in order to do that, we said, heck, why not?"
"And in states like Georgia and Arizona, Biden way overperformed his numbers by 0.9 and 0.7 respectively."
You want to be a rebel?
Republicans thought they had really taken that off the map with Kamala Harris back on the ticket that has snapped back into battleground status in a pretty substantial way.
"That's a lot of fake news back there, too."
So you played with Mike?
I think Pennsylvania only 40% are college grads.
So all those numbers fall on him to where the jobs don't get added back while he's in office and they can manipulate numbers like this.
"Republicans, we've always said we support the police, back the blue."
They still have a voter registration advantage.
We didn't yield.
We're trying to pull back on the counterinsurgency operations in Middle Eastern backwaters no one has heard about.
The effect that's having on the electorate is that it's polarizing people.
New polling from Emerson College shows Harris neck and neck with Trump in those swing states.
And they did it every Friday.
They love our country.
And then it's R plus 5.8.
Did he do a good job?
You can cut the check for Native Americans.
Hillary was plus eight point two.
This was after an abysmal debate performance.
This is the second time that he has been here since someone tried to kill him and tried to threaten his life.
"You know, just a few hours ago on Thursday, the Biden Harris administration announced another round of student loan forgiveness, bringing the total amount of student loan cancellation to more than $175 billion."
Let's send President Trump back to the White House.
But the polls have been pretty even nationally and they show a Trump victory.
And so we will start to see more and more money go into that.

"So if we want to talk about Democrats improving here, this is where it's pretty good."
Trump?

They're going to vote Democrat.
But it's not just Harris who needs Pennsylvania.
"But when she was running for president back in 2019, she agreed that a total fracking ban was necessary."
"Actually, the Oregon Governor's 2022 campaign margin dropped to a single digit mark."

The evidence showed that Nancy Pelosi should have had protection at the Capitol that I offered her and they turned it down.
That's where I talk about things that I can't talk about here.
"I mean, I can tell you when I talk to Republican leaders in Congress and in the Senate specifically, they weren't talking about Pennsylvania earlier this year as one of those places that they thought they were most likely to flip."
"Now, the other thing about this state today that I think is interesting, we're going to talk about this a little bit later in more detail, is the Senate races, because Casey, the Democratic senators, is in a tough race."

This was part of the deal that the Trump team reached with the Biden team.
Right now there's basically a statistical tie in the state of Pennsylvania.
You power our honest reporting.
"Well, let's turn to local journalists in Arizona to see what they think."
"Social media and and making it a major issue You know, the problem is is that we're numb where so much of this are we're numb and not just numb But there's a there's an amnesia factor involved here, too but I guess that That's what I meant about a normal country a normal country would say that these are important issues But we are numb and we are exhausted I think by some because there's something every single day and in terms of my particular Job still as as as a journalist when I'm not teaching I think that's important enough to point out even if people are too numb to take it on and Even if I end up having a smaller audience Maybe because people don't want to read it on that kind of stuff on any given day And I'm gonna write a column about this tomorrow about these COVID tests In your column you use a very personal and partisan voice Was there something specific that?"

"US Congress certified the winner, President Joe Biden, after the insurrection."
It's hard to say for sure.
"Thanks very much, Dylan."
"So, they're trying to address something that they believe was a shortcoming of Hillary Clinton's campaign."

The economy is a top concern.
"You got a convention in about 10 days, debate September 10th."

But that seemed to kind of put it over the edge.
I think it's a little weird if you don't mind me saying it's.
More resurfaced tweets are even more disturbing.
"Unlike in polls, traders are betting on the Olympic women's boxing controversy."

"And on these issues, Donald Trump and Republicans for large clearly have the advantage."
I still don't know what my debate plans are.
We are all praying that he is okay.
"It was on a Sunday, and we were still in the driveway, and I had received a call from a colleague telling me that the White House was trying to get in touch with her and I, and that she said, please, if you get a call, let's try to take this together."
"Sorry, I struggle reading the day."
He was like basically vegetable.
Kennedy's comments come after his decision last month to suspend his campaign in battleground states and support Trump.
It's a little bit tough.
"Notable Grand Canyon state Republicans like Mesa Mayor John Giles, former state rep Robin Shaw and former Scottsdale Mayor Sam Campana all giving their endorsement to Kamala Harris rather than former president Donald Trump."
"God, I know maybe a little bit hard for you to hear me because you're in the middle of that crowd."
That's what it is.
"So if folks out there are concerned about this issue or concerned about costs, but if you're just concerned about keeping a majority in the United States Senate, I hope they will help us by going to bobkasey.com."
And that's because we saw how bad they are.
"This is not good for Harris because Suffolk should be Harris plus eight Harris plus nine insider advantage, which is a way better pollster than Suffolk."
I know that you will never forget your family.
"That's what we normally do during the monologue, yeah."
Seven hundred thousand voters right now.
"That's if you're on the east coast, 10, 11 o'clock your time."
"I think what's interesting is how Biden is going to message this because we've all said for the better part of a decade now, and we've said, you know, this could be the thing that finally turned suburban voters against Trump."
And you could probably tell why it's Harris plus one.
"That we see in each other our connection, our interdependence, what we see in each other which fortifies and reinforces that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us."
But I think last time I think 91% of black women voted for Joe Biden.
I believe life begins at conception.
"A lot of toss up states, really interesting numbers."
"So we got right here under the age of 50, they polled, what's that?"
We didn't have any electronic devices.
"Again, this is not an end all be all because maybe there'll be a bunch of requests coming up, but this is comparing, it's not comparing 2020 versus 2024 versus 2020."
"There could be some of them like that, you know, some Democrats that realize they f'ed up and they switched parties, but the ancestral Democrats, they've been voting Republican for like 20 years now, especially in the last 10 years, especially in western Pennsylvania."
It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country.
I'm not really sure what was behind them refusing to identify themselves when they're even wearing jackets with their names on it.
Again you can really see that both campaigns really making a push for the Latino vote across Pennsylvania.
"We don't know if it's somebody who is just insane, but regardless, they're going to throw every dollar that they have at it."
"No matter where you are on the issues, how could you go along with that?"
Here's just a little bit of like chump change for you.
"Politico, they outright admitted that the Harris operation in Pennsylvania is a complete shit show."
"All right, so that's good."
That was back when Biden was still the presumptive nominee for the Democratic Party.
Do people really believe that Kamala Harris has the same appeal to these voters that Joe Biden did the exact same appeal?
"Or maybe they'll be used for, you know, I don't know what they'll be used for exactly, but I know, you know, the government denied that they were going to do the long range missiles."
Not the 330 million of our fellow citizens have to deal with.
And she's the only one who called Trump winning in Pennsylvania.
"And I know that sounds crazy on paper like, well, OK, Pennsylvania is worth 19 electoral votes the most of any swing states."
Which is that they're crazy.
"Today in Pennsylvania, Vice President Harris will be joined by several Republicans on stage."
"He's going to be heading to Arizona and Nevada later this weekend, this weekend."
There's a lot of back and forth about has she done enough to make the case for herself?
I want to give some shout outs before we get started.
"Like, first of all, before you even got to how you're hotter, which is just insanity."
"I mean, there's I'm just a little bothered by a lot of you know, she made these decisions, right?"
"Brother, that was a million years ago."
"However, in these sort of focus groups, I've heard from people that when you actually bring up abortion, it sort of lights a fire in the room for a lot of women, especially."
There was rumors of an Atlas Intel drop over the weekend.
"We're all in a row here on the rafters above the stage, above the seated area."
And economic uncertainty.
"So we can all follow along with him because he says it's all very, very simple."
"â€”Let me ask you about some of the strategies that she's deploying and what you think works and doesn't, because one of the groupsâ€”and people are voting across the country right now in all the key swing states, includingâ€”they will be in Georgia this week as well."
There isn't a candidate named Camilla.
"So we got a Suffolk poll coming out there, B rated pollster."
"After facing off earlier this week on a Philadelphia debate stage and standing together in New York for the September 11th anniversary, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are on opposite ends of the country today."
Trump is going to be strong.
And that was their thing.
These poll results highlight a tight race between Trump and Harris in Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania will vote for Trump by a more margin than the average poll result indicates.
If Harris wins it.
Both Harris and Trump are trying to sway as many undecided voters as they can.
The race started out in the teens.
She'll do well in Allegheny County.
"Although, again, I have my reasons why I think it might be the Democrats this time."
Kamala laughing with joy and spreading enthusiasm and love for America.
"And in either case, it'd be the same exact people that are the staff behind Kamala and Biden."
And she has associated her views with them and has in the past said that she thinks fracking should stop.
"Thank you, Mabinti."
These things.
"You know, that kind of rhetoric is garbage."
This one request is very important.
"And because of them, we ended up with some good music, right?"
"Right now, he's slated to be the victor in Georgia."
That type of voter is showing up on the Democrat side.
But Insider Advantage released this poll.
Every poll in the RCP average has shifted at least three points towards Trump.
"On the other side, Shapiro pointed out that the government of Trump prioritized tax cuts for the wealthiest, leaving behind the very supporters from the working class who were the driving force behind his triumph in 2016."
"And even in 2020, the final average for the RCP average was spot on."
The Trump campaign is going to try and get those rural voters that he has such tremendous success without.
"So for example, in Montgomery County, you see that the Republicans have had a decrease in 7% of their totals."
It sets a precedent for other states with similar election integrity disputes.
"If I'm Kamala Harris, I want to be up in the polling average by four to five points."
We losing recipes do you understand?
"Yes, I do."
So here's what's going on.
It doesn't get much more center than Centre County.
"He was asked, this is kind of interesting, what advice he gave her."
And now the people of Florida are dealing with another devastating storm.
We see that here.
"But if he's able to convince some of these ultra conservative Republicans that Trump may be comfortable with this or giving his vote of confidence for him to go forward, he might be able to pull this off."
And so it will be very enticing to watch just how much this election is defined by what happens at this moment in time.
"He's caught, by the way, I hate to say it, he reminds me of myself in these situations because that's the way I would handle it."
"When you compare it to 2020, it's going to be different."
"And then, you know, more inner-city area, suburban area, see more blue signs."
That's all gone.
"Both campaigns will likely focus heavily on turnout efforts in key regions, particularly the suburbs and urban areas where Democrats have traditionally done well Dot Pennsylvania's electorate is diverse, with significant variations between urban, suburban, and rural areas."
Astronaut and a fighter pilot.
This might not seem like much.
They take them seriously.
So is that the reason why someone like former President Trump appeals to you because he has been canceled in a similar manner?
And J.D.
National security people.
"I'm sorry, the great John McCain."
Kamala Harris make major improvements relative to President Biden.
Fox News sucks.
And that's why they reacted that way to him.
You cannot tell me that.
And you cannot win the state of Pennsylvania on Pittsburgh and Philly alone.
"So message, we care."
They wouldn't save anything because you would think that'd be the last time Trump would run.
"The same thing for migrants in different communities, not just Hittians, Venezuelans, or Mexicans in generals that are applying for asylum, which is basically a program that is legally based."
"I am the governor of the great state of South Dakota, but I'm going to tell you one thing."
"Alright, this is Harris vs Trump margin in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
"And so I think that is what you're seeing, that that positive reaction from younger voters actually motivated for the Republican candidate, which is great to see."
"The question is, is it going to be by enough to win?"
"They most of them, the majority of them, Hannah, have said there are things they like about Shapiro."
"Edwards then asked if he could disseminate the photo further, and the rest is history."
He did very very well in Macomb County and I think that's a very good sign for things to come in Michigan and it shows that Biden doesn't have a lot of support in the key places that he needs to go out there and win in order to win this election.
"That is at $6,000 for the first year of the child's life."
"When you think about it, I guess that's right."
They're mad.
"We'll go to Muhlenberger first, because it's got a 6% margin of error, 450 votes here."
Whereas Trump almost kind of invites it on himself where he does so many.
"So that's something key to remember Kamala Harris, let's give her Wisconsin and Michigan if she also gets Pennsylvania nothing else matters."
They call you weird.
Does that change how you think you're gonna end up voting in November?
You are primer on the race to the White House.
"In particular, a key constituency."
"He now people don't believe that, obviously."
I think Amory and I keep coming up with new questions to ask you.
Are they even worth paying attention to or are they just going to make us more anxious?
There's also been some reports that there are a lot more Republicans registered.
There's NBC reporting this morning talking about how neo-Nazis are championing the fact that he brought this to the debate stage.
And she is doing piss poor even compared to Biden compared to Clinton.
It is good to be back in Arizona.
It's great to have you both.
"And mass, right?"
"It has consistently been a part of the so-called blue wall of democratic states, voting for democratic candidates from 1992 to 2012."
"Well, just for a week."
"And that's how you frame it, Bob."
And I didn't have a guitar.
They are looking for a vision in Kamala Harris message with the governor.
What is this here?
And this would be.
I don't.
"Jason, thank you so much."
"Tim, you know, critics will will look at Liz Cheney going going on the campaign trail with Kamala and say and basically say, look, look, she didn't even have enough of a constituency to stay in the house."
"You die by the swing ometer when you adjust these demographics, which you could make a case for it."
These are Democrats saying this.
They have been.
I've seen rappers on your show.
"And what this was supposed to be was a town hall moderated by Christy Noem, where Trump was answering questions from voters in Pennsylvania."
"And I never believed the polls that had President Trump up six, eight points."
"And and so to decide that you're like, who is the person that is going to be persuaded and was like, you know, I wasn't really sure whether I was a Kamala or a Trump person."
"And, in fact, I believe if you look at the internals, it's actually a Trump lead."
Just look at November of 2020.
"However, we're done for, guys."
"Yeah, well, let's take a look at this."
And they'll scrutinize the hell out of polls that don't look good for them.
"We hear this all the time, especially in your great state of Pennsylvania, which I also used to live in."
Kamala is lying to the people for their votes about their very livelihood.
This was about 605 on the East Coast.
We're getting good numbers out of North Carolina.
"But the number one takeaway is not just Republicans didn't turnout, but where they actually did was Mahoning County, which is an ancestrally Democrat county in the district."
"Kamala Harris won, as far as I'm concerned."
"Bowers was questioned by January 6th committee member, Congress member Adam Schiff, a Democrat of California."
"But now it's, it's a harder call just because I am not a fan of Donald Trump."
"So whatever you can do it, I'm gonna really that I could push anything is to get Governor Walsh."
"I mean, this is a contentious race here right now, and you know from being here in Philadelphia with the presidential debate with David Muir, this could swing the Senate one way or the other."
Pennsylvania is the ballgame.
"And Arizona is the state where generations of pioneers and prospectors, miners and ranchers, cowboys and cattlehands, marshals and lawmen, tamed the frontier, braved the blazing sun, and showed the entire world how the West was one."
That's why early on they had such a big lead and right now they actually have a decent sized advantage.
Now we're going to retain them and they deserve it.
"And in that- No, no, no."
"But regardless of what either person would not be running the country, it'd be the staff behind them."
What was it outside of Nevada in 2016?
That's the it's mirrors those complaints.
We're taking a look at the Rasmussen reports poll that was in the margin of error.
"And they should have strategized and he should stick to the strategy, but he can't help himself."

"No, I don't have money for emergencies."
"For that matter, do you think Donald Trump has ever changed a tire in his life?"
It's not the same as like Wisconsin.
Nobody was guarding the ballots or election computers these people have gotten their hands on to run their audit unless you think the Trump supporter running the operation is some kind of an anomaly.
Everything is aligning right now.
I can.
They sit and they just want or Trump just talks about himself.
Where are they?
"I mean, you know, Arizona has a long history of split ticket voting in 2018."
"Again, we don't have any evidence for that either."
The intense focus on Pennsylvania in the lead-up to the 2024 election underscores the state's significance in shaping the future of American politics.
Let's talk about a couple of battleground states.
"The eighth poll was conducted by Marist College between September 12th and 17th among 1,163 registered voters."
"On health care, Harris has been a vocal advocate for expanding access to affordable and quality coverage."
The economy remains at the forefront.
"The Democrats will pull funding, but we can't really endorse Harris because then we've pissed off more than half of our workers that we represent and they might pick it."
A poll conducted between September 28 and October 8 offers a snapshot of the electoral climate among registered voters.
So that could bring these voters back.
"And I think those of us who care a lot about politics, you know, sometimes it's red jerseys versus blue jerseys."
We'll leave it at that.
"We also talked about the absence of color in civil rights photography, the intentional absence of color to make those photos seem older than they are and more historic than they are and what would be more accurately a like very modern snapshot of American modern times."
They came up with the Trumpy Trout.
"They have Harris at 49%, they have Trump at 48% in their poll."
So Trump was losing in Ohio and in Florida that night.
"So the question is, what's going on?"
"The tenth poll was conducted by Morning Consult between September 9th and 18 with 1,256 likely voters."
And you will probably see a decent swing to Donald Trump.
"Fracking is indeed and at the heart of the discussion, Camilla, Camilla Harris has flip flop on this issue like a gaffed tuna."
"In the conversations which included Liu, and Harris's deputy chief of staff called Sergio, the leaders asked for a greater presence at local events."
"If it's plus Republican one, that's good."
We talk every night and have a good time.
 All you hear is that the Democrats are the ones with the amazing ground game and the Republicans less so.
"These numbers suck for Democrats and even returns, which that's the copium Democrats are using, but the absentee returns."
And I think that's kind of where Pennsylvania will go.
"For all of the working people struggling under the commoners, inflation nightmare, we will have large tax cuts for workers."
"They will lie to you with a smile on their face, shaking hands, kissing your babies until you were both faced lie because why lies make you feel good when someone's inauthentic, as long as they're able to appeal to you and how you feel as all that matters, her decision right now or her validation behind leaving the GOP is purely based on the emotion, not about actual policy that'll help her life go forward."
You think Donald Trump's ever changed a diaper?
"So back when Barack Obama won this area, he had 49% of the vote."
"If these were in fact gunshots, are there concerned about everybody's safety as people are now moving in aimless directions, bumping into each other, bumping into tossed equipment?"
Hope you've subscribed so you don't miss out on a single episode.
Those failed policies haven't worked in the four years that Donald Trump.
We are pushing them to vote early in the election to make sure that they lock in those votes if they're not going to be home on November 5th.
"All right, I'll give you a hint."
"If Kamala gets four more years, the entire country will be turned into a migrant camp."
You don't hear that every day.
"Well, in a word, it was crowded."
"Jenny, thanks so much for being here with us today."
"Her $1 million donation to Harris' campaign underscores her commitment to environmental protection and sustainable energy, issues Harris has consistently prioritized."
But I do believe art and comedy and music that is the engine driving these topics to the surface.
You need me.
"And now it's like, he's totally discombobulated over Kamala Harris being the Democratic nominee."
They're not going to let you crack.
The gas is home enough Garretocracy go home go home Enough Not only are you old you're wealthy.
We would be on track to winning.
Trumpy Trout is an animatronic talking fish with a big personality.
"Trump's primary campaign message has focused on election integrity, arguing that stringent measures are needed to prevent voter fraud."
"He currently leads in enough states right now to get to 270 electoral votes, which is absolutely huge."
"Well, the former president knows some of their names now and is trying to get them replaced by people who are loyalists to him."
Put Trump in a bullseye.
What's particularly interesting in this state is the way in which the electorate has shifted.
" Well, we're just 26 days away from the election and the road to the White House is once again running right through Arizona."
I don't agree with my kids.
"She is the backing of Donald Trump, the backing of Paul Gosar, the backing of Mike Lindell."
"Now, let's analyze all seven recent polls conducted in Pennsylvania."
We can definitely hear it in here.

"In fact, you remember?"
"Fetterman did not end up winning by six percentage points, but it kind of just shows you how these things are really starting to shake out."
"Which is to suggest, which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down."
And they are going to continue through the night.
"And this point in history, Biden led by 5.2%."
Thanks for waking up with us.
Do you know anything about that?
"But on Poly Market, the night before Walls was chosen, there was a random surge in favor of Shapiro at the end, just randomly surging, right?"
"Well, for example, just a couple of weeks ago in her plan to support small businesses, she talked about the investment climate that we need in order to help entrepreneurs start small businesses and grow."
"And that's going to be a huge factor, whether you're a Trump supporter, whether you're a Biden supporter, and specifically, as we talked about, for those undetermined voters."
And you gave a perfect deal.
Pennsylvania bakery cookie poll shows Trump crushing Harris.
She has this.
You mentioned the Trump trials.
"So that's the municipal elections are nonpartisan, as they are in lots of lots of places."
There's momentum for Harris.
"Both Michigan and Wisconsin right now pretty much are states that look like they are going to be in the blue column, but if we look at a lot of the polling, it shows that Pennsylvania might be a little bit more of a toss-up, maybe even go into the Republican side."
"Cooper's interest in urban development and affordable housing drives his support for Harris, who has outlined plans to address the housing crisis in America."
"Ryan, you're a Republican."
And you had a lot of these COVID only voters who voted by mail in 2020.

She has a good track record.
Our family friend is 67 now.
This Republican pollster tells us what we've known for a while.
That's who Kamala is.
Another Trump term with JD Vance would be far worse and would lead our country down a path that I don't think we could ever recover from.
"What does it say, um, about, about this ticket's working class appeal that even, even though he was endorsed by the leadership of the organization that he was speaking at, the rank and file were clearly hostile to his campaign."
"Is this just ancestral Democrats in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, Green County, Washington County?"
Do it.
"And so when you, when you break that, like, you know, if, if, if Kamala and Liz Cheney being together can get some people to break out of that mindset, it does, you know, create an openness to rethinking certain issues and being more open to like the progressive point of view on certain issues."

"The bipartisan deal that Kamala Harris supported, even though it was written by one of the most conservative Republicans in Congress, and Donald Trump deliberately lobbied against it and told Republicans don't vote for it because he figured that if you passed it, he would not be able to engage in the same kind of fear-mongering that he's been doing."

Decisive.

I was happy that it was handed over to the seats.
"If it wasn't for that, you're talking about like a four point miss because of Marist."
"This is an arena with 15,000 seats and there's not enough space to allow reporters inside with notebooks and cameras and all the things that they need to do their job."
"I'm sure that you think that a policy debate would be better than a personality debate, but if President Biden had gone on stage and spoke about the size of a pro golfer's penis, I think you would be on this show right now saying you were shocked and appalled, and you would suggest it was evidence of his cognitive decline."

"But in the end, immigration, inflation, reproductive health care and the fate of American democracy, those are the issues that show up again, again, again at the top four of lists of voters in our surveys and everyone else's major."

It's nerve-racking.
"It's to me, it's great."
Looking at.
Always nice to talk to you.

"Kamala Harris has borrowed Trump's homework a couple of times, but otherwise, she has, at this point, and this is inexplicable, even for the Kamala Harris campaign."
"But if they can't play basketball, they shouldn't be joining."
Nearly 5 million Americans have already cast their ballots in this election.
But we were the best.
"Like, you can afford to lose Nevada and of course, Nebraska's second."
They're going to steal the election and they're going to try to say it again because the Democrats are behind it.
"It's your boy, man, Small County J in the building."
"And number two, a lot, like most of those people were very old and they had other underlying problems."
You have a public record of when they cast their vote.
"2020, Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden."
He got 14 million votes.
"There's got to be somebody that genuinely cares about us and has real policies and real ideas, that are realistic."
And my opponent will never support that legislation.
"We're going to start really ramping things up and putting some funny stuff, some interesting stuff out there, some collaborations."
"She's the next president and, you know, we can all like send Donald Trump back to the Cougar Den at Mar-a-Lago or maybe even to jail."
Alright in Pennsylvania.
A stark contrast in two candidates.
He needs to do more of that.
"His name is going to be on there, embossed, right next to Luke."
"You had Adam Kinzenberry, you had Liz Cheney, you had Charlie Dent, who represents the Valley."
They couldn't count them until that day.
"Nevada has traditionally leaned Democratic in recent elections, but the dynamics can shift based on various factors, including economic conditions and demographic changes."
We are trying to find out.
Chuck Schumer has become a Palestinian.
No further details are available.
"This would suggest it would be over a hundred K, but we would expect some of these people to show up and vote in person rather than the mail."
That's what I said.
"And I think whatever people's opinion on the question of democracy, you can tell a liar when you see them try to dodge a question."
"Now, Pennsylvania has always been a pretty close state."
Everyone gets really excited for these.
I think it's more the hidden Trump voter.
Why is she honing in on this particular area of the state?
And then she shows this recent fundraising gambit from the Arizona Attorney General.
"People couldn't believe it, right?"
Hillary Clinton only won it by 3000 votes.
"They sit down, they walk around, they spend the day with them."
"Early, they're going to vote on Election Day."
"Uh, MS 13 DNC, the difference between work and Trump's Trump's stage McDonald's theatrics."

"And just looking at this, they were more than likely overwhelmingly Jewish."
"Engaging on a three day barnstorming swing through a vital battleground state, this time Pennsylvania."
Today we're diving into the heated battleground of Pennsylvania as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump ramp up their campaigns for the 2024 election.
This is a dying nation and I'm not going to die on this nation.
"Well, sir, do you want to play your song and then greet a few people?"
It makes a lot of sense.
The only state that's more of a dog fight than Pennsylvania is actually North Carolina.
I'm excited for Kamala.
"We're getting things out of Nevada, Arizona."
He has not earned the right.
Harris will return to the Keystone state tomorrow for a campaign event in Philadelphia.
They complain that they've been left out of events and surrogates haven't even been deployed effectively.
We'll be checking up on that later.
"Even though that's not really true, they don't align themselves with Donald Trump."
"In the meantime, they can't afford their groceries."
And I think these polls are certainly pointing to that.
It's inexplicable.
Now he said Democrats complaints are a reflection of their anxiety over a tight race.
But I can tell you this.
Trump is beating Biden in the state of Wisconsin.
"You align yourself with all these neo, these neo-cons, right?"
This is Outnumbered.
"But when it comes to the presidential race, understand that in Pennsylvania, maybe looking at sort of on a football field, you can maybe get 49 yards up your side of the field."
"But you know, RFK Jr. made a comment, you know, say we're being poisoned by the air."
But anyway switching gears a little bit from one state to another and from one sense to another of the campaign we are in the final few weeks and we've noticed that there's been kind of an explosion in populist economics from both campaigns in these closing weeks.
Donald Trump was just a good president and he's the best president of my lifetime.
"Let me tell you, we, um, I think it was about a month ago, we swept the Dodgers in LA."
"Let's hit a few other topics now, Kayla."
"I mean, the thing to look for in Michigan, blue collar state, Biden did go there and he stood on a picket line with the United Auto Workers last year."
"I think what we've seen from 2016 and his experience over the last eight years as president and also as non-president now, I think the one thing they're looking for more than anything else is loyalty."
We'll keep it good.
"The only person I know to ask her hard questions was this guy says, was the brother on 60 Minutes."
And so they did start a sort of an inquiry into it.
I can't afford to purchase a whole animal this year.
We shall start in the Midwest with Wisconsin and Michigan.
"And they don't get them as big, but we had a great time."
"I hate to see it happen, of course, but there are people in this country who were cheering for Custer, and there are people in this country who cheer for the Sioux."
"Anyone who doesn't have a big race of their own and is a boldface name of the following, whether it is Bernie Sanders, whether it's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, they're all hitting the campaign trail right now on behalf of Kamala Harris."
"From the very beginning, the masks should not have been political."
He likes to talk about Kamala being Vice President for years.
She could go to Georgia.
"This can lead to higher enthusiasm and turnout among his supporters, who are likely to view the legal victory as a validation of their concerns and motivations."
"The outcome in Pennsylvania could very well determine the next president, making it a battleground state that will continue to draw national attention."
They keep calling people a tinks and lying about reparations and then trying to argue why it's appropriate to mutilate your children.
I feel like More so She should wait I don't want to per se vote for someone that is a backup All right.
"These are all effective things that really went a large way to making, you know, give Walz a national platform to say, hey, look at what Democrats in Minnesota have been able to do."
Maybe that's why she can't answer even the simplest of questions asked by 60 Minutes and others.
That Donald Trump does not represent us.
"ACFR vote conducted a poll between September 1st and 25th, showing Harris leading with 52% to Trump's 48%."
"Over the last four years, the Democrats have lost about 91,000 voters, whereas the Republicans have gained about 103,000 voters."
"I mean, the guy gets so high off cocaine, he smokes Parmesan cheese, but still, it doesn't matter."
I kind of forgot.
I just heard one.
" I think it's kind of chaotic, but I am really excited that Kamala is running."
Or this could be less than one percentage point of a win for someone.
"As to her completely desperate request from my medical statement, she's dying to see my cholesterol, which is 180."
And that is all I got to say for this video.
"I had a lot of disagreements with Senator Obama, but I served with him."
"Here's is literally flipping burgers, literally flipping burgers."
"Before we get into the video, please consider subscribing to the channel and comment down below on what other videos United States need you next."
Only one of those counties went for Donald Trump in the 2020 election.
I think his passions really came out.
"It's been in the press a little bit Kamala Harris talked about it in her appearance on Howard Stern and But it's two days later and you know, where's the you know, where's the outrage?"
"In 2020, Georgia was won by like less than 13,000 votes."
I think it's... You're not brat?
"But I think there has been a sort of awakening across the board when people have seen, you know, on one hand, you have this extremist group whose leaders are facing conspiracy sedition charges and whose members were accused of using force to block Joe Biden from president."
"Alright, that's all for today's update."
You get the idea of what's going on.
"So anyway, just play it."
Get Karen's in there.
Lots of fun stuff.
Over half.
"Biden performed really nicely in 2020, really."
"In Pennsylvania, as you know, Rachel, a lot is on the line in November."
In-person is always going to favor Trump.
That's a runaway Trump train.
Appreciate the time.
"I am here today because this is the election that will decide who we are, where our children live, the opportunities that they will have."
You can't get much more local than a legislative race.
"Now Kamala Harris is in fact late into the race, has managed to put together one billion dollars."
So you look at this and all around does seem like Republicans did well in Nevada.
And one of the beautiful things about these next 79 days is what the people in this room have already been doing and know.
They will turn America into a third world country.
"Yeah, they had a head start in early voting, just the simple fact that Allegheny, Philly, Chester, the Democrat parts of Pennsylvania, they started voting earlier."

Immigration.
"He knew that if we get in the habit, if we get in the habit of bending the truth, to suit political expediency or party orthodoxy, our democracy can't work."
But this takes it to another level using it on political enemies.
He's talking about that he considers anyone who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will and enemy of our country.
"Things are changing in the traditional states as well as much as they remain the same, though, you know, states like New York, states like New Jersey, states like Maine, states like Washington, states like Washington, D.C., states like Delaware, states like California primarily remain blue, states like Florida, states like Texas."
You can't spell Arizona Arizona without AZ.
And I genuinely mean that.
It's they're not doing that.
"Like, I know who cares."
And yet this is a longtime conservative state here.
"And Nikki Haley has received more than 100,000 votes in the Republican primary in Pennsylvania."
"Because if you win it, you're probably gonna win the presidency."
So I want to just address you all right now as the volunteers.
"But these new registrations are not coming from those people by and large, which means that already you're seeing a ridiculous amount of these never voted before people vote."
"And those earning about that threshold may over the US taxes, despite already having paid taxes in their host nation."
There's no question about it.
"He did good in box, Montgomery and Chester."
"And as he said in the debate, he made clear he has no plan to replace it."
"And then... And then this statue of Lucille Ball spoke up and said, Ermiglerd, you're a cur."
And that's why you gotta vote.
And Kamala Harris making these massive improvements relative to President Biden have only continued and the momentum has been built and it's gaining in a very good way for the Democratic Party.
"So listen, let me know what you think and in regards to this whole matter with Trump."
She's ready to be commander in chief and she released her medical records.

"In the fourth poll, also conducted by Fabrizio Ward, on the exact same dates with a different 400 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 47%."
And that's the expectation.
"And just to go back to what Nathaniel was just talking about, one interesting thing that we're seeing at the last minute here is how the map has sort of changed a little bit."
They took a lot of pictures.
And we have to usher in a new era to bring about just solutions to these decades long conflicts without.
But that is not going to end result.
"Congressman, I've got a little bit of a weird one here, but just stick with me."
Harris is also underperforming against minority voters.

If you want to unify people because I think that they have a way of really controlling the narrative.

"But in the polling at this point in the polling, he was up by like a ridiculous five points in the industry."
And so we'll see.
"Well, Major, it's certainly not something that they are sharing explicitly with us, but sources say that they are well aware that that has started to follow up among key groups."
The difference between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is the difference between chaos and sanity and incredible competency as well.
"This narrow margin reflects a competitive race, with Trump staying within striking distance, showcasing his resilience and ability to maintain strong support in Pennsylvania."
No one has ever seen a fish like me.
Pollings average which currently has Trump at 47.7% versus Harris at 46.9%.
We are still upwards of 200000 ballots to be counted.
"This is Ohio where you're running, JP."

If that ended up being true.
There's no sign actually that there was anything wrong with the presidential vote in Arizona.
I'll give you a sense.
We're going to have to sit back and watch how everyone responds to this and see if everything I just said plays out which I know it fucking will but until then something in my stomach is telling me we're cooked we're so cooked.
The former U.S. president was busy on his campaign trail.
"By focusing on these issues, Trump hopes to strengthen support from rural voters and attract more middle-class suburban voters."

"She silently inspires so many black and brown children, young adults, and adults to keep pushing and pursuing their goals by showing her strength and consistency to break all glass ceilings placed above her."

But let's take Pennsylvania out of Kamala Harris's column and put him in a Donald Trump's column.
Let me go full screen for you guys.
"Secretary Pete Buttigieg, someone who has a great future in the Democratic Party and President Biden's cabinet, someone that is close to the vice president and someone to keep an eye on."
Virtually all of Biden's margin of victory came from improvements in Northeastern Pennsylvania.
How was your meeting with Vice President Harris?
"If even if it's plus Dem plus two, Dem, that that would be good as well."
You should be proud of it.
And what's the president doing?
I know what it's like to come from a working class family.
Does he look at these numbers in Pennsylvania?
High school.
Good stuff.
"Now, of course, they say he didn't really lose."
"And it's again, the same, the same script she used during the debate."
"One house to the next, they change."
Carlos is a truck driver and a lifelong Democrat voting for Harris.
Donald Trump has not won a popular vote in the elections where he's been at the top of the ballot.
The finish line is in sight.
"I'm not really sure how many people have to get up and say that the emperor has no clothes before large numbers of people begin to say, oh yeah, I guess he doesn't have any clothes on."
Not just one of them.
They're still in the phase where they're talking about this panacea of EVs.
"We're at a point in America where Congress can authorize a bill, and it means nothing."
Jason.
"Because what I have to say is going to make so much sense that even if I'm coughing a little bit, I think you're still going to catch what I'm saying here."
But our polling showed that Trump was up three in North Carolina.
I want to ask Republicans out there.
There's a lot of disdain here for the election deniers who are basically on the statewide ballot.
Trump is winning in every single swing state.
Now I'm not going to ban fracking.
And not in her like she didn't do anything absolutely wrong.
So really seeing Vance in downtown Pittsburgh today is the exact opposite of that.
"Obviously, we have to condense it."
"Because remember, Biden only beat Trump in Arizona by just 11,000 votes."
We turn around and walk away.
Democrats saying this is just former President Trump speaking on the topic of the hour.
The links are all in the description down below.
You can cherry pick a few words or lines out of a two-hour event.
"And this, again, is an endorsement of Newsmax even."
"Well, you know, I've been a Democratic strategist for a long time and I've been on Fox a few times on all the shows."
So Pennsylvania is a huge one.
"Trump's anti-immigrant message and recent lies that legal Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating cats and dogs, has only made these Republicans question their party more."
They all then gather around a door and go in.
"Pennsylvania is worth as much as North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada combined I believe."
The election campaign in Pennsylvania is intense.
This was two weeks and they were off by six.
"He caught some heat the other day, you know, and so he comes out with this statement that all of a sudden he's a believer in IVF."
"You know, Hannah, I'm in Bucks County."
"But other than that, I mean the guy's in great shape and Trump has lost a couple pounds since the election ended."
"We all had to go through magnetometers, had to have our bags checked, had to have our electronics checked."
"But yeah, man, we better get into our political bag."
"You either have to get them a mail-in ballot if they're a trucker and they can't make it, or you have to make sure on election day they get off the sofa or they get out of their job and they spend the time standing."
So we're going to win Arizona.
"I'm sorry gentlemen, I've noticed this especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down is a sign of strength."
"Sonic weapons, exactly."
"We had three bulwark events in Philly and Pittsburgh and Detroit, and it was tied to the Republican Voters Against Trump bus tour that was going across the two states between Pennsylvania and Michigan."
I'm a middle class person and I think that she will do good for us to help us gain more effort in our income.
"I mean, this is a guy who makes it up as he goes along, can't find a lie that he doesn't love."
"But also this abortion up to the ninth month thing, it is just poppy caught and it is what are the words I can use on television?"
"In Michigan, a similar dynamic."
"Because of my economic strategy, companies and jobs are coming home again."
"And I said, I've got some good attorneys, and I'm going to give you their names."
They called a free talk in Arizona.
I haven't had one in a long time for all agents and a ten thousand dollar each retention and signing bonus.
Some of them are remaining true.
Making sure their voices are heard.
"They rarely, rarely, rarely ever leave the state and haven't recently."
But you take that energy out.
"Thank God the feds decreased the rates, but at the same time, people are not going to be able to find houses because nobody's going to be selling them."
With its 19 electoral votes potentially tipping the scales in her favor.
It's not something I think about.
Like she doesn't want her past to be brought up.
It had access to the ballots.
Everybody been saying this shit when is somebody gonna do what's right for America and no I am not for violence but this man is trying to become a dictator and trying to take everybody's rights away.
This person's really a Trump fan.
"And really, I thought there was going to be some correction and maybe there was some slight correction cause Trump went up by about 12 and it's come back down a little bit."
"But from the folks who are directly tasked with protecting the president, they do not seem to be viewing this as something that got in here anywhere near an actual attempt or something that necessarily would have even turned into an attempt."
"They love using law fair to get their agenda done, but that's CNN burning on Kamala Harris."
And I think a big issue is freedom and abortion and a woman's right to just simply make decisions over her own body.
"Tudor Dixon, Trump's latest pick for governor, has perpetuated the falsehood that Trump actually won Michigan, he in fact lost by more than 100,000 votes."
"The public's perception of her as a candidate, along with her ability to forge authentic connections with voters, will play a critical role in determining turnout and overall support."
Her campaign strategy reflects this delicate balance.
"Additionally, Harris is making a strong push to connect with younger voters, emphasizing the importance of education and student loan forgiveness."
"With the singer endorsing Kamala Harris, do these high profile endorsements even matter that much?"
We know that people are struggling to put food on the table for their families.
"But several factors could sway the final outcome in Pennsylvania like economic issues, voter turnout, suburban voters, and energy policies."
"And not only are people believing this, meteorologists are getting death threats and angry phone calls and emails from viewers who think they're covering it up."
"And since then, it's only shifted further to the right, as we saw incumbents, Governor Ron DeSantis and Senator Marco Rubio, both win re-election by double digits, 19% in Ron DeSantis's case, and then 16% for Marco Rubio in the Senate race, respectively."
"Get the hell out of here, you're fired."
And I love it.
"We have 180 million being spent so far by the Democrats, 170 million by the Republicans."
"From House Republican leaders, we have heard what?"
"So let's just say, okay, Minnesota, Virginia, Harris wins those states, New Hampshire, Maine, whatever."
And they tell us that's super important.
"Both candidates are practically living in Pennsylvania, with Kamala Harris making multiple stops across the state and even participating in the Sept. 10 presidential debate held in, you guessed it, Pennsylvania."
"And look at the difference, 44 percent of plurality, clear plurality."
It is nonstop.
"Up in Phoenix, the state headquarters of Planned Parenthood is named after Barry Goldwater's wife."
"So the ad emphasizes he's bashing by it and not directly Harris, but he's running to Trump and that is a concerning sign for Kamala Harris because He literally praised basically praise Trump a little bit in a sense in that ad and that was just striking to me and maybe it shows his internals that Kamala has some Pennsylvania problem that we're even seeing reflected in the polling average a bit to the point where It's I mean alarm bells for Kamala Harris like look at the election shuffle."
"He, as you know, is, uh, appears to be not well."
"Y'all know that girl, Baby Stormy, I don't know who's going to get this video, who's going to watch it or not, but the girl, Baby Stormy, who tried to expose I Spice for talking about Nicki Minaj, right?"
"And especially the use of AI with the voice and things like that, they can manipulate it."
And it's not just about where people live either.
Does it impact your calculation for what you do?
I wanted to shake up the dynamics in our in our valley.
You got a couple.
"Drew, thanks as always for joining us."
But it's been way less than 2020.
Trump has sort of ignored this as an issue.
"Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania has the highest probability of getting the nod according to traders on polymarket, the crypto-based betting platform."
What do you think of this policy right now?
Because a victory of that nature would be well beyond where it was even for Trump in 2016 or Biden in 2020.
"Yeah, the fracking and the natural gas industry really does speak to the industrial heritage of Pennsylvania, steel, coal, cement."
I think I don't believe to be like being Discriminated being a racist or something.
"And of course, invest into other states, but mainly those two."
No one wants that.
It doesn't make sense to.
"She also held a bus tour through western Pennsylvania, even making a snack stop at a local Sheetz gas station."
She was talking about it before she was even running.
"No, he cannot lose any of these states except Nevada."
"Russia and Ukraine have both accused each other of striking civilian infrastructure, with both denying doing so."
So obviously the jobs are going to come back during Biden's administration.
And so you will find that this Democratic sponsored poll probably is misleading in the sense that Kamala Harris is probably not up four points in Pennsylvania.
"You know, I would, I would tell you the greatest thing about this industry, plain and simple is you can be an 18 year old kid."
That's huge Absolutely massive.
"And for people who say, I don't know, I don't know if I can vote for Donald Trump, the one thing that you cannot question is his children."
It is the most important swing state.
"Now it's a tie sometimes, depending on the day, Trump has a narrow lead."
"And actually, it's a little bit more likely than the polls are leading on to."
So is this only for black entrepreneurs or is this for all entrepreneurs?
"And Sam, it's great to have you here."
"It was more on the Republican side and the former president trying to leverage this idea of party loyalty over country and by party loyalty, I mean loyalty to him."
"Mr. Pittsburgh, how are you?"
"Again, she keeps saying my values have not changed."
5.
"High heat affected more than 100 blood drives in July in nearly every state where the Red Cross collects blood, including Pennsylvania."
And now continues doing so.
There's about 10 different bills that are pro-immigrant that are currently in the legislature that we've asked his administration to support.
"But Mike, we do have a lot of police presence out here, police standing right in the middle, right between these Trump supporters and this counter protester as well."
It doesn't tell us everything and that's very true.
"And if you look at this a little bit further, he says which party cannibalizes their votes is one of the keys to the election."
And no one can answer that question with a yes.
"In a CBS YouGov survey, 82% of Pennsylvanians listed the economy as their number one issue."
Can we please crack the top 25 and stay there this year?
It's so sick.
"So he's really going to have to drive home this issue, particularly on the economy, especially in the blue wall, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin."
Why are they the way they are?
It's a place that was won by President Biden.
James.
"Now you're hearing them say that, Oh, they lost so many jobs."
"Well, one of the big issues the article points to is the campaign's leadership in Pennsylvania."
Hello.
I'm about to take you through Donald Trump hood.
He hardly played at all on three seasons.
"Um, I think that' So there are women that a realization that personale saving the country and sa especially with trafficking as long as they get the j feel?"
"With 312 electoral votes, Donald Trump readily secured reelection by his highest margin yet, Kamala Harris at just 226, the worst Democratic performance since 1988."
"Pennsylvania, often referred to as the Keystone State, holds a pivotal position in American politics."
"Now here in 2024, Florida Atlantic University just released a survey here, showing Trump up 3 points among more than a thousand likely voters."
So it's hard to say how much these polls could be misleading.
"Let me hear that music, please."
They had different healthcare policy.
I will look at it at the time I'm not looking at anything now.
"I have spent many years looking at Bucks County, thinking about Bucks County."
I heard today that it was an espionage case.
" And as we look forward to the election, we have some breaking news that broke just moments ago."
May God protect our truth.
"He's very much about governing and less about idealistic, that ideological politics."
I know it looked kind of too easy and only got him in the ear Doesn't look like any bullets hit anybody else.
Now we have a new poll from the New York Times with Sienna College this is an A plus rated pollster apparently the best the best even though their polls are all over the place that this election season but they show Kamala Harris with a four point lead when you don't round out the results over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania when you round these are the numbers that they give us it is 50% for Kamala Harris 47% for Donald Trump a three point lead when rounded when you unround Trump falls down to 46% which gives her a very impressive four point lead in Pennsylvania and you will look at why this four point lead is so important not to mention Arizona of course while we have this poll up Donald Trump really expanding his lead in Arizona to now a 6% margin very impressive for him but we you know we really have had this common consensus now for quite a while now for months now that Donald Trump will carry the state of Arizona as well as other Sun Belt states but Pennsylvania is the important one here Arizona only has 11 electoral votes Pennsylvania has 19 in such a close race like this that eight more from Pennsylvania sorry yeah eight more on that really does matter a lot so that four point lead is important because we always talk about you know how much are the polls overestimated Joe Biden in the 2020 election right because when you look at 2020 he was expected to win by only four point seven percent and I say only because take that with with a state like Wisconsin in 2020 where Joe Biden was expected to win in the polls on election day by eight point four percent he only won it by point six so he was overestimated basically eight percent almost in the state of Wisconsin while you head over to Pennsylvania again he was expected to win by four point seven he won it by one point two so he was only over estimated here by some three and a half percent so to see Kamala Harris with the four point lead on rounded in Pennsylvania that's big because I do want to preface this with saying that I don't think that Kamala Harris will be overestimated in the polls at all I currently think that she will be underestimated in the polling so even if she is overestimated as much as Joe Biden was in the 2020 election in Pennsylvania she still wins again Biden was overestimated by three and a half percent in Pennsylvania when you do the math Harris has a four point lead currently she would still win the state by a very narrow margin so Pennsylvania is hugely important right you know so that was just to show you know how important this single poll is considering that it isn't a plus pollster but now we have to talk about Pennsylvania because the fact that the fact the matter is she is running away with Pennsylvania it's a very narrow lead um in in of court like the average I'm in the aggregate of polls um which is expected and again I don't I do think that Harris will outpace what polls are expecting I really do because poll stars are pollsters are worried about underestimating the Trump factor once again and everything like that so they are really boosting Trump's are they're giving an emphasis on Trump areas because they're you know the polling industry is you know going down right now in the dumps um so again they're really trying to get it accurate this time not underestimate Trump ultimately I think that Harris is being underestimated now just like 2022 the Democrats were but when it comes to the average you can see Harris has never let up once in the state of Pennsylvania that's insane that is absolutely insane Harris has kept a lead in Pennsylvania this entire race now let's compare that to a state like North Carolina for a moment we see we see um in the beginning of the race Trump had a pretty steady lead then Harris took the lead for a moment there for literally like two days then he was even then Trump took the back the lead then it was even again Trump took the lead Harris took the lead by point to Trump took the lead Harris took the lead Trump took the lead again Harris took the lead Trump took the lead and he still has the lead less than 1% this is the case and this is the most extreme case but this is a case that's going that's happening with many many many battleground states Michigan not Michigan sorry Wisconsin Nevada especially Arizona Georgia for sure but what you notice is that it's not happening in Pennsylvania and that's important the fact that there is a common consensus in the polling numbers is important fact that common layers is a clear leader is a clear favorite to win in Pennsylvania that's important let's just take a look at at the 538 forecast here let's I don't know what they are currently projected to be honest um they say that the presidential race is extremely narrow but I assume they say of course that Harris is favored to win in Pennsylvania you can see there she has a 52 to 48 percent chance of winning the state but looking at Pennsylvania specifically again it is so incredibly important that Kamala Harris does have a lock on Pennsylvania that's what I've been saying for a while when you look at the electoral map Pennsylvania proves to be extremely important this is my forecast that's the map these are all the numbers this is how I think that the election will go if it were held today or tomorrow or whatever so Pennsylvania is critical obviously to Kamala Harris on now if Trump does win Pennsylvania Kamala Harris actually still wins the election however she then has literally zero wiggle room the only place that she could lose is Nebraska second district resulting in her still winning the election even if she loses just Nevada on top of that you know just two slight changes in my forecast then she loses the election 267 to 271 however however North Carolina is basically toss-up I have a Harris plus 0.1 percent because I don't know it's too hard to tell there are too many factors Mark Robinson being on the ballot the state shifting left rapidly right now there are so many factors to consider North Carolina it's virtually toss-up I think that Harris wins by honestly a few thousand votes so look I would not be surprised in the slightest if Trump wins North Carolina because the odds really are 50-50 in my forecast right now considering that margin of Harris plus 0.1 so if North Carolina does go red which you say I'm on a chance that it goes red as it goes blue then she can't lose Pennsylvania then she has to hold Pennsylvania so the fact that she as I outlined she is you know she has this sort of lock on Pennsylvania right now as she has had throughout this race that's important because it is critical to her path to victory then if she holds Pennsylvania she could even lose Nevada Nevada could even go to Donald Trump and it could still result in a 270 win for Harrison walls 270 is the minimum you need to win the presidency that is just two electoral votes up against Trump and Vance so North Carolina and Nevada could easily go Republican but as long as she has Pennsylvania she wins the election and she holds the other blue wall states now what if Trump wins Pennsylvania it's you know obviously it's important to Harris's victory but if Trump is going to win the election of course I really think that you know he might need Pennsylvania however that he doesn't need it he could he could simply just run the Sun Belt North Carolina Georgia Arizona Nevada and then flip Wisconsin I think that Wisconsin will be closer than Pennsylvania so that of course can absolutely happen but if Pennsylvania does go red it really opens the door for Donald Trump if he wins the Sun Belt plus Pennsylvania he's at 287 17 more than he needs then he could even lose North Carolina and he still wins the election or he could actually lose he could even lose Nevada and Arizona and he still wins the election 270 to 268 so you know Pennsylvania everything weighs on Pennsylvania almost Donald Trump and Kamala Harris still paths to victory especially Trump Trump still has a path to victory without Pennsylvania however Pennsylvania is one of the most likely states to go to either candidate because of how split it is right now so it's very good for Kamala Harris when she gets polls like this which shows her from an A plus pollster with a pretty steady lead in the most critical battleground state Pennsylvania and again I think that she will win it Joe Biden won it by 1.2% in 2020 and what we have seen is a massive left-word trend in the suburbs the suburbs that dominate Pennsylvania elections and we are seeing massive left-ward trends across suburbs or in suburbs across the nation so if Pennsylvania can continue to trend to the left then the Democrats are in for a really good result in Pennsylvania so look at this Chester County Pennsylvania vote for Mitt Romney in 2012 by 0.2% he lost the state Obama won the state by 5% fast forward four years later Chester County went from 0.2 for Romney to 10 for Hillary Clinton now Donald Trump won the state so while the state as a whole trended seven points or six points I should say towards the Republicans Chester County became ten points more Democratic that you never see furthermore he went from ten points in 2016 to a stunning 17 points for Biden in 2020 suburbs eight Donald Trump and I believe that now more than ever with someone like Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket for the Democrats she will be able to really continue this trend possibly you know trend it more these at least Chester County trend it more towards the Democrats than we have seen in past elections in 2016 and 2020 so that's the state of the race right now in Pennsylvania hugely important state Kamala Harris definitely favored to win so thank you all

"That would be like quoting, since you've been gone, but not the chorus."
The first mail ballots will start going out to voters on Friday in many states.
Liz was talking about abortion rights and reproductive rights and how terrible the Texas law was even for somebody that's pro-life like her.
What an idiot.
"In the midterms, their lead was not as big, but they still led by 13,000 at this stage in the game."
"Together, Harris and Walz present a powerful combination of experience, perspective, and vision."
 And welcome back.
"That's it for me, everybody."
It's the battleground state.
Where's Abe at?
"And first off, just tell me about this surprising moment."
And Biden wants to ban assault rifles.
Democrats can't afford to lose any ground with that demographic.
"And so you need people there overseeing the process who know how audits work, who know how to count ballots, how to keep track of ballots."
We're going to have to slug it out.
"Oh, I heard you just said, I think we're okay."
There's no question.
"Well, you heard Nancy talk about this very effectively a few moments ago."
"And the thing about that is, you know, these voters are going to get older."
"So it's complicated, you know, in terms of how we look at it, but the inside battle for it and the likelihood of it being the tipping point state is so high."
I'm looking at the political situation.
"The race here not only reflects fierce competition, but also portrays the overall political landscape of the United States."
"That's, you know, with debates, it's not just performance, it's expectations."
I apologize.

What's your assessment firstly of where they're at at the moment when you look at Donald Trump and Kamala Harris?
"Arizona has become a focal point in national elections, characterized by its rapidly changing demographics and shifting political allegiances."
Harris is trying to reach people who are on the fence or may just not want to vote.
Nothing to do with me.
"So I think when you see those voters, that's more of a good sign for Brian Fitzpatrick's turnout operation than anything else."
So Atlas Intel also did polling and look at this.
I hear your point on this.
"This legal victory serves as a concrete example of Trump's commitment to securing the electoral process, which can enhance his credibility among voters who are concerned about the potential for fraud."
There is not symmetry between these two different media sources and how they view America.
"So city officials said that at that last rally, they submitted a bill to Donald Trump for $35,129 and he has refused to pay it."
He never voted for Trump.
"Back in 2020, her favorability rating numbers were not good after that 2019 and 2020 presidential bid."
She did great against Donald Trump in Chester County.
"Georgia has only recently become competitive, North Carolina They have it once since Obama So those are the three states that are the most kind of straightforward path if she wins those she doesn't need anything else provided nothing else flips and so that's the most logical path and It appears to be the way that she's going to be most efficient a couple of important events on the campaign trail as we were just Showing our viewers on Bloomberg TV tomorrow Donald Trump high noon interview right here on Bloomberg TV and radio with our editor-in-chief John michaels wait Wednesday Kamala Harris sitting down for an interview with Brett bear on Fox News These are two important conversations that will be following closely and we'll invite you to our special coverage tomorrow starts 1130 Eastern Time As we walk up to the interview with Donald Trump now We want to turn to the Middle East another important story We're following today with some updates the Pentagon Announcing the US is sending more troops now almost a hundred along with an advanced missile defense system to Israel to help protect from attacks Coming from Iran this comes as Israel has yet to retaliate for the barrage of missiles that Iran fired earlier this month We spoke earlier today with former NSC official Hagar Shemali on the early edition of balance of power It is something that is meant to beef up that that that security to definitely send a message across to all Across the Middle East that the US is going to defend Israel is going to stand and support Israel You know in case of any kind of attack But it certainly indicates that there is they they are expecting something and they want to be there just in case Joined now by Bloomberg's Michelle Jim Risco at the table with us in Washington Michelle We've had a couple of updates not only that defense missile missile defense battery I should say on its way to Israel with dozens of Americans who will be there to run it But Benjamin Netanyahu according to the Washington Post Now saying that Israel will strike the Iran military when it responds We're not sure when that happens and that's as opposed to oil installations or nuclear facilities Does the Biden administration then in fact have some influence after all?"
"I mean, even for the Asian community within ABC network."

You're ready.
"And yet he did two points worse, nearly a 10 point difference that if it was any other type of national circumstance, J.D."
So that is the charging that took place today.
"where it's you know, this quote says you can't put a singular label on Polish American voters is what Kuzma said, but It does give you a possibility of hey Can you flip voters right as opposed to just boosting turnout because with Haitians you probably aren't gonna like flip all that many votes Just because there's probably not that many Republicans but you know with this one you potentially could actually flip people so it'll be interesting and I Don't know if you can make a good meme of it out at this point But like how massive these sort of the Kamala tent is right now is pretty hilarious So it'd be pretty funny to just kind of be able to look at and see like, okay, where exactly?"
Proponents say they are a more reliable measure of sentiment and source of forecasts than polls because bettors have money on the line and are strongly incentivized to do thorough research and express their true beliefs.

"But Trump is also a little bit ahead in some key issues when we're talking about economy, you know, the inflation border security."
" According to brand new data, it appears that Donald Trump's gonna get a huge victory in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania."
Never once.
"So that shows you where we are as a country right now, where 60 to 70% of people don't aren't doing well."
"In Wisconsin, Trump leads by 0.2%, it is so exceptionally narrow."
Let me let me ask you this just to follow up with you on.
Any kind of energy you see is false.
Trump is going to mention this event in every single fucking appearance moving forward the right is going to make t-shirts and mugs and merchandise out of it he apparently mouthed the word fight so expect to see that picture with some filters on it with the fight thing or some tiktok edits expect for the right to get even more radical because of this event and as more information comes out about whatever happened if this was a shooting and that shooter has any left-wing beliefs at any point I'm talking if they liked AOC's tweak at one point in their life it's fucked because anything that you say against Trump will now be painted as oh they're too radical and look this rhetoric caused yeah.
"This is part of a swing that Donald Trump did last week, including speaking to law enforcement members and doing a town hall with Sean Hannity in Pennsylvania, a state that the Trump campaign has repeatedly made an emphasis and focus as they head towards November."
"John, it's good to see you again."
Does it's a complete mess?
"We are witnessing a full on attack on hard won, hard fought freedoms and rights."
"But the question, are these candidates truly on board with the MAGA agenda or just looking to get Trump's seal of approval and the spoils that come with it?"
They want a more sophisticated understanding of how to engage with diverse voting blocks.
"We want to talk to you Pennsylvania politics, too."

The bets are programmed into a smart contract on the polygon blockchain.
And that's exactly what the poll ended up showing.
And that will be the final report.
He's on our side.
"I don't know if she does have many more opportunities, if any."
"Despite this, Harris has reasons to celebrate, as new polls show her leading Donald Trump in several swing states, suggesting a potential new electoral path through the Sun Belt states."

How do you think Waltz specifically can connect with not only black voters but also young voters there in the Keystone state?
And everything else looks blue.
And it was Republicans who won it.

He's that old.
What makes Pennsylvania a fierce battleground for both parties is the remarkable combination of demographic and geographic factors in this state.
My dog's been taken.
"In fact, she may do worse in some places."
All right.
On having a successful presidency.

"And overnight, just eight and a half hours after getting his marching orders from his leader, Governor Greg Abbott complied with his leader."
What is happening?

"So if you're a Democrat, you have to look at that number and say, that's pretty good."
"Man, this is already shaping up to be one wild ride, don't you think?"
"Neither is Walls, who's made it his signature issue as governor."
And there are some that have already awarded those electoral votes in terms of projections to Vice President Biden.
You can literally search the January 6th committee archive and see the depositions and testimony.
"Here with me now in Phoenix is Arizona Secretary of State, Adrian Fontes, who's also an executive board member of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State."
"Now your papers do, and you just write on a sheet of paper, concept of a plan."

Trump began.
"And not necessarily just the ones I put on, you know, we had six votes."
"It's probably going to come down to Pennsylvania, but right now, look, everything has been positive for Kamala Harris for the last about what, eight, nine days."
I say pray.
" Rain or shine, they showed up for President Trump tonight in Western Pennsylvania and it was pouring rain."
We've had enough of them.
"And of course, folks like myself thought that she should take Josh Shapiro, of course as the governor of the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
You're not going to see the same numbers.
Where the election is too close to call.
"And Kamala Harris decided to put somebody who may claim to be from the Rust Belt, even though Minnesota is not really the Rust Belt, but has a track record of a nut job."

"And if you look at the board, the Democrats have to win almost all of the swing states, including the two heavyweights, which are Michigan and Pennsylvania."
I just want to go down the line with all of you and just very quickly tell me who you believe won this debate tonight.
Well she has a whole post dedicated to that one which is boom.
We know that she wrote a memoir so we know that she lived in Virginia for a very long time perhaps pretty until recently.
"But, you know, it was so fascinating to see the way his media and the secret service all work together."
But I can't change that because they believe it because they've heard it so many times.
Got to take care of them.
And you don't do that in every state.
"The amount of television ad spending by Democrats and Republicans in Pennsylvania reached $350 million, $142 million more than the second-ranking state, Michigan."
Because we know what he did the first time didn't work.
This is just footage of them.
That all sounds wonderful and like the sort of thing that you would expect and hope that any elected official would say in response to the kind of rhetoric being promoted by Trump and J.D.
Make sure you follow me on x links.
"There's a group called the Uncommitted National Movement, which is a coalition of people who supported the idea of voting uncommitted in the primaries."
Trump almost did better than 2016.
They think she is too extreme.
"We were the only state to never take the elevated unemployment benefits because I said, listen, Mr. President, our people want to work."
He's a good man.
It is what it is.
 I want to zoom in on one voting block this morning.
I like the idea of of of walls saying it's not political to be for political for public education.
"It's been a tougher nut to crack, obviously, for Republicans here."

They are some of the most accurate pollsters in this entire nation.
"Thank you, Congressman Jolly."
"It was a celebration of American workers, a testament to the enduring power of hope, and a call to action for a brighter tomorrow."
Jesse.

"Exactly two days ago, I shared the last 14 polls in Pennsylvania, where Kamala Harris won a big victory."
"Okay, massive keyboard for life."
They switched to green and red pens.
We are fighting for peace and prosperity for the American people.
We could have sold that thing out four times.
It's true because she's even less of a solid candidate to appeal to these people in terms of that demographic.
And that has really been her M.O.
"She went right after his comments about using the military against American citizens who he calls, quote, his words, the enemy from within."
Do you know what verbatim means?

To their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next that is immoral and One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree The government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body That sound obviously that moment was a critical moment Not just for the debate on one of the critical issues of this campaign on the issue of reproductive rights and abortion But there's also one that garnered significant reaction from our focus group Don't ask about right now for those of you who responded positively to Vice President Harris's answer.
"In our Commonwealth, Kamala Harris just seems to keep doing exactly what she's doing, which is showing up in communities that are oftentimes ignored and left behind forgotten areas that you know, in the past had maybe been flyover areas for national candidates."

"This is a state that former President Donald Trump won in both 2016, again in 2020."
We have to have a buyback program and I support a mandatory buyback program You can't do it by executive order any more than Trump can do things when he says he can do it by executive order Does the vice president have a point there some things you can?
The Harris campaign will certainly be trying to turn out votes in Milwaukee and Dane County around Madison.
The narrative surrounding turnout is far more than just a matter of numbers.
"Yeah, definitely Donald Trump."
She got the lowest ever on record.
"But when you look at our polling on the issue of immigration, he does leave Kamala Harris."
"Instead of like trying to recruit candidates that are solid, that he could prop up from the beginning, that share all of his values, he typically just wants to endorse whoever he feels like can win the election and might align with him the most or said something nice to him in the past."
"I agree, but it's a little bit more complicated."
The recent ruling provides a tangible victory that Trump's campaign can use to energize supporters.
I'm sorry.
"But now the recent polling, it's Trump plus one Harris plus one."
So more people were voting absentee.
I liked her message of unity and the division that we have in America I like her fight for the middle class and families The reason I didn't give her her an A was I thought She needed to go into a little more detail on some of her plans How she would you know do some of the things that she envisioned?
That's the job.

JD Vance is taking away from the ticket.

He's totally beside himself.
"Harris has the slimmest of margins in the averages in Pennsylvania, slightly wider margin in Michigan and depending on whose average you're looking at either up or down in the state of Wisconsin."
He does all the stuff.
I understand Kamala Harris is outraised Donald Trump.
And he's the next president.
I want to start with this new polling that continues to show an even tighter presidential race than what we were seeing even just a week ago.
"Also, you're going to have these three House races up for grabs as well."
"Here, play the clip."
President Trump is himself.

He wants everybody to dislike each other.
They are the precinct committee men.
I was late today.
"And the real reason, the real vote siphoner wasn't Jill Stein, but it was, what's his name?"

"Representative Summer Lee, Representative Chris Deluzio, I want to thank you and then of course your two senators wanted to be here today and in their absence I will say that Senator John Fetterman, I was just speaking with his wife who's here, is a leader of profound strength and courage and we are so grateful for his service and in the United States Senate many of you know when I was a senator for the time I was there I had the great joy and pleasure of working with Senator Bob Casey and I'll tell you what you know."
"No, no, absolutely not."
Don't get me wrong.
He saw what was happening and he jumped on top and he got... Then Donald Trump says that Vice President Kamala Harris is not tough on crime because she's only tough on people like him.
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 47 percent each.
"And so, sure, if you're winning in North Hampton and Erie County, you're probably doing pretty well."
"And the real worry, Judy, that I think we all have is not simply that people are discussing these theories, but that, in reality, majorities of voters, when an election happens, don't trust the outcome."

Erie is sort of one of these critically important swing counties.
"So if you are talking to friends and family and neighbors, and it's hard to have political conversations right now."

I will not ban fracking.
"Anthony, this isn't the first poll in recent weeks to show that the two candidates are neck and neck in Pennsylvania, which is considered perhaps the most coveted battleground in this year's election."
I admire our esteemed vice president.
"But unlike Kamala Harris, I think Trump needs Pennsylvania."
I've never got a real balance on where most Republicans who are not voting for Donald Trump feel about that.
But this was in July.
"LaVance seems to be trying to twist himself into a pretzel on this, trying to please Trump in the face."

The white house says president Biden or the Trump hat for unity.

"And what there's no evidence that that one attack or that one, even a conviction is going to be the thing that breaks the camel's back."
Am I worried about that?
But this is not about moving a constituency that is feeling deep pain.
The rallies are the biggest we've ever had by far.

"In 2020, Kamala actually had to pull out before it even went there because she couldn't even make the primary."
"Man, I don't want to do your job for you, but those are the obvious things to do."

"When Kamala was Vice President, she got a 28% approval rate, which is lower than, I think it was Mike Pence, lower than Dick Cheney, and lower than Biden."

"He will be doing a big rally tonight in Detroit, and he'll also be visiting a campaign office in an Arab American community in which the mayor actually endorsed him."
Trump said in that true social post He likened himself to a boxer who knocked out his opponent He says he knocked out Biden and he will knock and he knocked out vice president Kamala Harris within that second debate Those are his claims The second reason he says is that voters are already voting so that they don't need to have a second debate between him and Vice president Harris voters are not voting yet.
"No, but I don't know if it's because she doesn't pick him or he ultimately bows out."

"We got the Make Cats Safe Again merch, which is a best seller in the Trump iconic design."
"So, you know, and they said two people are in the hospital right now, critically wounded."

And I'm not entirely sure Dr. Oz does that and the guy's got a lot of controversial statements in his past surrounding a wide variety of things.
"And now he's getting off on tangents on our people eating up their immigrants, eating pets in Springfield, Ohio."

"Well, that's fine."
"That state is, of course, crucial."

What Obama meant was that the Democratic Party is seeing a slump in support for Kamala Harris among black men and that it was a major concern in the upcoming presidential election.
"So it just doesn't really make sense to me as to why, if she really wanted to help the country out, why would she have the ability to do that right now?"
"I mean everything is too high Everything real estate is high Like your house is technically worth three four hundred thousand and now they want seven eight hundred thousand Yeah, or the same house."
And now Kamala Harris is losing on the nuclear politics average by just 0.2% nationwide.

It needs only a new paint job.
"A post-debate shift through small suggests voters are warming up to her, added Malloy."
"And to help her do it, she needs a Senate full of public servants like Ruben Gallego."
"At this event, she still talked about how we need home healthcare for seniors and reproductive rights and healthcare, you know what I mean?"
That's going to be a key question.
And I think it's because people see that she's offering a positive vision for the country and rejecting the chaos and division of Donald Trump.
"Yeah, not seventy thousand."
"So the way I kind of look at these things with, you know, 40 days or so to go is who would I rather be?"
"MS-13, vicious."
"No matter what she says she's going to do for them, she's had nearly four years to do it."
"Just months ago, the republics were asking for this exact bill to deal with the border to provide support for Ukraine and Israel."
She will drive out the white women in wisconsin She will win And I want y'all to go on twitter after this live and search gretchen whitmer And watch how the republicans are attacking her as we speak because they are deathly afraid of this woman They're so afraid of this woman.
"Okay, look, an NBC national news poll put Kamala Harris's favorability jumping 16 points since July."
"I mean, it took him a while to figure out how he would get there."
"In 2016, he only got 45.9% of the popular voters, somewhere in that range."
"However, I don't think they're completely worthless."
Hello everybody.
It is still conservative overall.
"Look, in all seriousness, though, Ben, I think if one is discussing this as if it is an affirmation or confirmation of Joe Biden's win, we're doing it wrong."
"So Bill Belichick's books will be something like, Eat, Pray, Grunk."
"We're turning to the site of that assassination attempt on his life and that's another like X factor in all of this, whether that helps to drive local enthusiasm for Trump."
Far more numbers out there to support Kamala Harris.
Duh.
"A keystone, if you will, but not always considered a battleground state."
We don't have a Republican Party that's an anti-Democrat party.
"He probably didn't like to say the results of those elections simply because of, you know, the narrative that was going on at the time."
This is all spongible money.
It is Pennsylvania.
"Access to capital is one of the strongest barriers to starting your own small business, and he will eliminate that."
"Going back over 30 years, every Democrat has won New York by a clear margin."
We love Trump.
And let's get in the top 25.
Did you ever feel like you had to stop the count?
We're probably in a two-point race.
It caused a huge commotion.
"And, uh, since we're, you know, the most iconic photo ever of a president had to do the fight, I got that on everything flags, yard signs, shirts."
I just came back from the dentist again.
A part of it is Democrats switching their party registration to Republican.
We were fighting.
"Like, you sound like cuckoo from Cocoa Puffs."
"That's why Pennsylvania, it's a pretty big deal."
This woman was acting weirdly in the back parking lot.
"Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020 by just 81,000 votes."
"And that message is going to be, get out the vote and get out the vote early."
And that's the only reason why he won.
"If it is as close as again as it was in 2020, it could take a while, especially with mail-in ballots."
" Former President Trump may be out of the White House, but his influence on the Republican Party continues to loom large, especially on the state level."
He's performed through all of this.
There's a lot of tweets.
Here's how she explained it on Twitter.
And then we just have a head to head with Trump versus Harris and absolute explosion of support for Harris in these polls.
Three candidate strategies.
And that's why we're actually winning.
I think the younger age is just so big it's it is for me.
"My God, that's easy."
They're so efficient.
It's part of it.
"He's still leading, but the gap has narrowed."
His substantial contribution is a vote of confidence in Harris' ability to make housing more affordable and accessible.
They're going to shift heavily towards Trump.
Many of the state's most well-connected Democrats have been worried about the operation for months.
"But this time around, it doesn't look like that if the polls are to be believed."
She certainly has shown no indication that she's going to go on a freewill interview spree.
A lot of just one ingredient type stuff.
"And while most Trump supporters, I would say, I talk to, talk about his characteristics, a significant group at every single rally I attend raised conspiracy theories with me, the woman who thought Joe Biden was dead, another woman in New Hampshire who told me she was sure that Mother Teresa was a man, and by the way, the father of Anthony Fauci."
This top survey from Remington Research Group is in Nebraska.
"Harris's lead in this poll is significant, but Trump's ability to secure 45% of the vote indicates that his core supporters remain engaged and enthusiastic."
"To me, the worst is the border, because it's like what they're doing is they're destroying our country."
And so the bar is so low and they expect excellence from her.
"The ninth poll was conducted by Marist College between September 12th and 17th among 1,476 likely voters."
"We do not want to hand him the keys back to the White House where he can continue to try and divide us, offend people, and spew more hatred and bigotry in our society."
"And he's always been unintelligent, etc."
"I think The Washington Post said, would the real populist please stand up?"
He'll never vote for the John Lewis voting rights legislation.
The Trump campaign and its allies have long championed the need for robust measures to ensure that every aspect of the voting process is secure and transparent.
"So you'll see areas around the suburbs of Detroit where Republicans have done well traditionally, but it's softer support."
"The last election with Joe Biden and President Donald Trump, Black women voted 90 percent for Joe Biden."
"Mark, Momma Kamala wants to ban fracking."
So play YMCA.
They're into the cooking world.
We're here to support our President Donald Trump.
"Every single one of them, including Trafalgar, including insider advantage, even Emerson, even New York Times."
"You know, I think he's going to pick up where he left off."
"So from July to when Harris launched her campaign to now the vice president, it appears, has managed to swing nine percentage points in her favor."
"Like I heard David McCormick over the weekend saying that Democrats, they're they're coming for your stakes."
But the Democrats in Arizona have spent about 14 million more than Republicans from Super Tuesday until this date.
So what you see happening at the gubernatorial level should not be a replication of what could happen at the state level on the presidential election with the presidential election.
"In fact, this number suggested New Hampshire was gonna be far more competitive, Maine was gonna be far more competitive, Minnesota, which is now not competitive at all, was gonna be far more competitive."
"The state's electoral significance is underscored by heavy campaign spending, with both parties reserving substantial ad time."
What is that betrayal?
Peace out.
I think that's the basic sentiment.
"He's probably gonna win the primary now, but I don't trust the guy."
And I believe if I'm not mistaken Donald Trump was the first person he ever voted for in his entire life only person for president.
But Harris is up by point five and that's with two big outliers.
I've been skating for decades.
"And I think particularly as a party, we haven't focused enough on rural communities."
"Like a lot of people, I watched the hearing, and I thought, thank God, there are principled Republicans who have the backbone to stand up to Trump."
It's happened many times in history They just failed when lawfare doesn't work.
"And right now there have been 416,000 votes cast in the state of Pennsylvania."
People are calling it bizarre this morning.
Where's the you know where people just repeating what happened and putting it on on?
"And then in Georgia and Arizona, on average, Trump leads by about 2 percentage points."
Concrete plans.
"No, but Chester County is a good example."
"Official crowd size report estimated at I don't know, 500 600 in front of me."
It's just crazy.
So Wisconsin 8.6% lead for Biden and he only ended up winning by 0.7 So you can see that it was a absolutely massive or 7.9 on Election Day We'll say 7.9 and he she only win one by point seven so or it's 8.4 on Election Day So he only won by point seven.
Can I just say that that's like the coolest version of Joe Biden I've ever seen.
"And he's an economic nationalist, which is good on that front."
One that helps us work together instead of turning against each other.
It's not a process that the press is being allowed to observe.
And it's not just Maricopa County because we share these databases with law enforcement across the state.
And so you better vote for her or else.
"So we can see here with these poll numbers here in Pennsylvania, you know, it says who's ahead in Pennsylvania and you have this 1.2 margin."
That's looking at the final choices.
So there's actually some there's some interesting breakdown within those undecided voters.
But there was so much veering off.
" What is up YouTube is coffee back with another update and yes, it's another update about Trump What a crazy scene we got saw go down today in Pennsylvania And I was saying in another video not just what happened today how it felt so surreal and just like what the fuck You know everything from how it went down to his reaction just everything And then you take that along with other stuff that we've been seeing in the news as a latest just like man What in the world is going on in these crazy times?"
One thing is consistent.
And you see that in all of his ads.
That very same clip unearthed and broadcast by Fox News is now making waves on social media.
She's gonna win in a landslide.
They get it posthumously.
Melendez moved from Puerto Rico with her family when she was 14.
He did reflect on the assassination attempt itself.
Every one of those three examples of important rights we have to protect.
"But yeah, there just seemed to be a kind of strange lack of focus from his campaign."
Opinion polls have shown Harris bringing fresh energy to the Democratic campaign and closing the gap with former President Trump both nationally and in many battleground states.
There he is apparently on the steps.
It's correctly called the next president three out of four times since 2008.
"Terry, let's unpack there."
"And last, I want to make it clear, if President Trump does a rally during a weekday, we are going to be busing people from whatever county he's doing a rally in to a board of elections to vote early."
"And I suspect that if the Harris campaign is successful at moving the needle on the issue, that that's the number to watch."
The extremes we're not going to change.
The candidates are tied in the battleground states.
"Every single one of these states, when we pull in these states to try to see who's winning, the answer is within what's called the margin of error."
They reject extremism in the race for governor in the race for US Senate and in the race when Donald Trump was running for re election.
How did he do it?
There are reports that the Haitian migrants were eating geese and ducks.
"Starwalt's observations highlight the importance of understanding the concerns of rural voters, many of whom may feel disconnected from the Democratic Party's mainstream narratives."
"That's Buck County, Montgomery County, Chester County, Delaware County."
"However, there has been a recent shift in the last few weeks."
The undying bond between men and animals.
"Kamala Harris needs to keep her attention on places like Wilkes-Barre, where she is not going to win outright, but she could lose by less than her predecessor did."
I think I'm much better.
"Kamala Harris is also favored in Minnesota, although this is mostly because to her choice of Governor Tim Walls as her running partner."
"On Capitol Hill, Trump allies advised him to steer clear of personal attacks."
"At this point, it seems like the divide is too big."
He sounds like he's coming from like the Electabro crowd saying this is all about winning elections.
"And what say you, what's your take on these moderates in Pennsylvania who are never Trumpers or pro-Kamala kind of in the middle, whatever your thoughts are."
So that tension simmering again is no surprise.
I completely agree with you in terms of brat and all these kind of Gen Z marketing.
"It's no coincidence that at both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, delegates from Pennsylvania were seated in prime spots just behind delegates from the candidates' home states."
And so there are distinctions certainly on policy.
So it's probably kind of around a tie here.
"Lieutenant Governor, let me start with you, because you were on a ticket with Governor Josh Shapiro in 2022 that really ran a 57-county strategy in the Commonwealth."
"In Arizona, nobody ever cared until we got close politically."
Duncan's choice was praised by Shapiro.
So thank you so much.
There's nothing really named after Kamala Harris in that part of Pennsylvania.
He didn't know him.
"Now with less than a month from election day, what is it that's keeping these undecided voters from knowing for sure, yes, I'm going to vote for Harris or yes, I'm going to vote for Trump?"
" Hi, thank you for joining us."
So that does it for this video.
"We, Pennsylvania, have helped change the dynamics of energy throughout the world."
"But what we have seen unfold over the last 11 months, the number, the numerous war crimes that have been committed, we have seen a president who has been unwilling to distance himself from the war criminal, Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet."
He is safe.
"Living with inflation in your family is a demoralizing experience, a winding down of the spirit of possibility."
Organize your community.
"They said the reason the crowd booed Trump when he said Kamala was an attractive woman is because to them, anyone of color can't be attractive."
Now Donald Trump stands at the lowest point he has been in this entire past three months.
"Now, along with that, right, why is she outreaching to rural areas of Pennsylvania?"
Can you tell me a little bit more about what brought you out?
"Nicole Killian in Atlanta, Robert Costa in suburban Philadelphia, thank you both very much."
"One, he's going to come out to many men by 50 Cent at his next campaign rally, whether or not 50 Cent clears it."
"These influential figures, driven by various political, social, and economic interests, have made substantial contributions to Harris' campaign."
You got to get out there.
"And we've seen Republicans cutting into Democrats advantage of registering voters in Pennsylvania over the last few years, so Republicans have increased their registered voters by a point, but Democrats have have seen a decrease by four points since 2020."
"So, we have a new poll that came out today from Harvard Harris."
"You've taken a lot of time out to really spend time getting to know these groups, covering these groups."
"I want to go down to Caitlin Huey Burns joins us just outside of Philadelphia, covering former President Trump's town hall."
Trump held a massive 36-point advantage over Biden in rural areas.
"If you win Pennsylvania, you're in a really good situation, especially if you're Trump, if you're Harris."
"Now you do have outliers, it's true, it's a hard state to poll."
I think that he wins on a tie.
I don't think it matters where the foreign purchaser would be.
Biden was actually up by about 4.5.
Maybe that little piece shouldn't be disclosed.
Do we believe in opportunity?
And he also keeps a kosher kitchen.
"And I'm sorry, but I just feel like all of this is so manufactured."
"If you got in, would you probably just be smiling the whole time?"
"But yeah, I'd be happy to see you in Shapiro."
Any other time it's fucking thoughts and prayers.
So how is he going to fix that?
They're doing so as quickly as they can and with integrity.
"In fact, the last update, I believe they're below 59% now."
I think that's that remains to be seen.
"President Trump, in his tenure in the White House, was a lot more affordable, and the American dream was in reach for our generation."
"Right, yeah, we did certainly see that."
That's not what Arizona wants.
"Not even, it's not even a vital organ."
So I got it.
Definitely banger Catch y'all next one
Those live stream cameras came out and people were kind of yelling at the poll workers inside.
"The senator from Pennsylvania, John Fetterman, warns Democrats that Donald Trump is far more popular in Pennsylvania than they think."
"Do some simulcasting out on a big screen somewhere, I would imagine."
He's a breath of fresh air Biden at this point.
"Guardian, Chris Riddell's latest cartoon humorously captures the Democrats' current advantage over the Republicans, highlighted by a bizarre conversation between Donald Trump and Elon Musk."
We went to the rental place.
They came here the right way.
"Okay, high five."
We have some late breaking developments tonight.
"The Hispanic and Asian American populations are smaller but growing, especially in suburban areas."
Trump had a seven point polling lead in our average and now it's a tie.
 Thanks for being back with us tonight.
I think she keeps on making bad decisions for the American people.
"In addition to the urban centers, the rural counties of Pennsylvania represent another critical dimension of the electoral equation."
So this is a county that both campaigns are fighting to win.
So they registered.
"You know, there's 100 Republicans now that have left and they're in Harris' camp."
"Why does that matter, ladies and gentlemen?"
We're going to vote.
Bibles and a sea shoes.
"I think Black women in particular are going to support Vice President Harris and they have galvanized, they have mobilized to help her win this election."
A plant was coming back.
So many interesting aspects of this polling.
"Oh, look, that person is now cooperating."
"It looks like while he had his head turned, speaking to a screen, he was in fact shot."
"Now, of course, he is not the president, doesn't have any control over the military right now, but it is this kind of heightened rhetoric that we're seeing in the closing weeks of the campaign."
Is he saying it because it's like the popular thing to do because of Hollywood?
"I don't exactly know what the issue was there, but still looking at the big picture when it comes down to it, Trump is leading in Pennsylvania."
"George Rivera, Jim Vinop, and Angelik Schneider, three voters in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania."
"The contrast is clear and I'll tell you what, I would much rather be us than them."
"So things are shifting really, Abhishek."
And so some of them called on him to drop out.
I feel like I'm going crazy.
So one third of every voter is under the age of 45.
"Thank you, Madam Vice President, for your leadership both domestic and abroad and for your persistent and enduring advocacy for underserved communities all across the country."
"Saturday, October the 19th, there are 17 days remaining in this year's extremely close and important presidential race, a contest that will ultimately be decided by the results of the election in seven swing states."
Even this vote was even the Vice President she polled for.
May God bless you all.
Let's face it.
But it's true for the voters in Belfon.
Ruben.
"But in Michigan, it is the EV mandate, the electric vehicle mandate that is a job destroyer for auto workers."
"This was a significant victory for Biden, given that Pennsylvania is his home state."
But that doesn't mean anything.
"So don't say I'm not voting for Republican, but I'm not that behind VP Harris."
And the products are a joke and they don't actually produce anything.
"So the point is that it's changing a lot and obviously it's very up for grabs, but Dr. Oz lost the state by almost six points back in 2022."
Harris's growth in Pennsylvania underscores how critical this state has become.
"Hey, don't scroll away."
They are fighting like hell.
"And so we were like, I wonder if we could get her."
"So, it is that makes the election very, very interesting, Abhishek."
"In 2022, a federal judge had to order members of the group called Clean Elections USA to stay at least 250 feet away from ballot drop boxes in Arizona after reports that some, quote, observers were masked and armed, taking photos and videos of people dropping off their ballots."
Donald Trump calling Kamala Harris not a smart woman.
"This is from MS 13 DNC, also known as MS NBC."
Now the Harris campaign provided a list of Politico of several examples of surrogate events aimed at engaging voters of color.
"I believe it's good for us to get money Money's part of fracking when and you just can't make this up her running mate called her Prostituted young prostitute or that may it makes sense You know, it makes sense."
"And now, and then Joe Biden, and my campaign manager in 16 was the manager for Pennsylvania for Joe Biden."
So thank you all for being here today.
You don't have to agree with everything that Donald Trump says.
"Remember, it wasn't just a rejection of these people and their personalities."
"Now, don't tell him I said that because go right to his goddamn head."
There's no denying that Pennsylvania is the key to this election.
We hear people angrily shouting and yet here they are.
"I mean, EVs are collapsing before our eyes."
"And then the Republican operatives were showing up at their houses in the middle of the night basically trying to talk to them, knock on the door, trying to get them to vote."
Our daughter Sophia was born into this world with more rights than she has today simply because Donald Trump was president of the United States.
"We first met the duo, both of Dominican descent, before former President Trump survived an assassination attempt and picked JD Vance as his running mate."
"They're considered either red, meaning they'll vote for a Republican, or blue."
"In the rural counties, Republicans still haven't really caught up to the Democrats in those areas as you'll see in this graph."
Do you expect that Senator Casey will run a little bit ahead of Vice President Harris?
"Remember, in 2016, Donald Trump clinched Pennsylvania by just 0.72%, but in 2020, the tables turned and Joe Biden reclaimed the state with a 1.17% margin."
That would be fun.
"Burnovich's heart may lie with Trump, but his obligation remains to the people of Arizona."
"Former President Trump went after Al Schmidt by name on Twitter, and violent threats from Trump supporters followed."
"So she's in a mud hut basically or a mud, not a mud hut, but like a mud puddle."
The party in power is less motivated to vote.
"Of course Pennsylvania is one of the pivotal seven swing states that Trump and Kamala, Trump and Harris have been focusing on in this election."
"Stierwald notes that in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton's inability to mobilize voters in Philadelphia effectively contributed to her overall electoral struggles."
"So you go to Pennsylvania House District 139, with just about all of the votes in, and the Republican won 58.3% to 41.7%, a margin of 16.6%."
"While reports of anxiety and all-out panic are beginning, and it could have Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign spun up just a few days out from the election as time is running out."
"Yeah, so early on, it looks like he's going to be focusing on Pennsylvania."
"Again, I am not denying that more than likely a good chunk of these new Republicans, they probably are from Beaver County, Lawrence County, Mercer, ancestral Democrats."
"Not only are they introducing restrictive voting legislation, they are also undertaking a truly insane audit of the 2020 election vote five months after the election."
"You know, hurricane season isn't over yet."
"They always asked me about Eric, about Don Jr. and Ivanka, all of the children."
I've never heard him say one racist thing in my life.
They prohibited her for laughing.
Former President Bill Clinton is also expected to hit the campaign trail for Harris as both sides make their closing arguments to the voters.
And I think a lot of people don't realize that the cost of energy is an important part of the cost of everything.
I'm remembering things I read over the last couple of months or so.
"At that point, he's winning states like Wisconsin, Michigan."
But then there's Gallup.
"Yahoo U.S., Michael Moore, the outspoken filmmaker known for Fahrenheit 9-11, is optimistic about Kamala Harris's chances in an upcoming debate against Donald Trump."
I think there's plenty of things we could work together on.
"If you're watching this online, you can hit the Donate button."
"Yeah, I know the camera and the teleprompter on this side is about half a mile away."
"Yeah, this is one of those, you know, we all like to read the electoral tea leaves before an election."
"Do you know if you'll be able to go back in, if you'll be allowed back?"
I want to be on one of those buggies.
"Not only did they just do that to the sitting Republican governor, Doug Ducey, both because of his actions during COVID-19, which have really been kind of, you know, middle of the road, not trying to offend anybody and really not doing all that much that has, you know, been terribly stringent."
"So it's this, I'll say it again, genuflecting to this man."
You think you need...
We saw a group of people inciting people.
"Thank you, and thank you for your work."
It's said by everyone all the time.
"And that's something that Donald Trump and I really believe in, is talking to the American people."
"Let the waves crash into that copper tone, bronzing cream covered face and make a big slick all over the sea."
"So former president Donald Trump was injured in a, by a UDA Saturday evening during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, trigger man and at least one audience member are unalived."
"But even today, as many of you know, too many parents know the pain of having a child sickened by contaminated water."
And now you've got people saying there's almost a 0% chance of knowing the winner.
They'll scorn them.
"We hope I'm so excited to listen to that because I'm totally in that culture, the whole alternatives, skateboard and all that."
"Yes, they are perfecto perfecto."
It's gonna lean blue with a Harris plus 5 lead there.
"A Republican who's only voted for a Democrat once, President Obama."
"But the language thing, that I understand."
Because it isn't actually happening.
"Even before I was running for President, I convened a bunch of black small business owners, all who were men."
"That said, we can win anyway by understanding what their intention is and doing our best to overwhelm the polls with our presence."
We're fortunate to have Kamala Harris as our nominee and our next president.
How many McDonald's you own?
"And still Biden may be getting in the nineties in some states percentage wise, but he's not energizing his base."
That's harder.
"And there has definitely been some concerns about the state of Pittsburgh, especially downtown Pittsburgh among suburban Pittsburghers."
"It has 19 electoral votes, and it is among the states that she would need to have to get to 270 electoral votes."
" In Arizona, former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis is now cooperating with prosecutors in the state's fake electors case, according to that state's attorney general."
It's really focused on the economy and it's focused on manufacturing.
"Hey there, I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC."
She's making real gains among Republicans.
I'm actually really hoping my college starts to offer bachelor degrees so I can graduate without debt.
And you see that in this race in terms of that is the top concern that voters have recorded.
And I would never do anything of such magnitude without deep consultation with qualified attorneys.
"Yesterday, Trump was in Reading, Pennsylvania, where Nurse Fatschett is going all in on these bogus stories about forced gender swaps."
"And isn't it, I don't know what the right word is, but like the two guys that shot at Trump was what?"
"Those little orange shades you see, those are the only states that are on the board."
"So we got 450 likely voters, all right?"
"First of all, I think Biden is actually far more intelligent, if you can believe that."
"I know if you, if you listened, David Plouffe did an interview with my old colleague at the circus, John Heilman, and he says that their data shows basically 4% of the electorate is undecided."
"He's given two, two and a half hour speeches, just word salads."
Now it's down to seven because of polarization.
"Or do you want to, well, you had said you wanted to close with a specific song."
It's a ping pong county.
"And Pennsylvania alongside many other battleground states has seen quite significant shifts in favor of the Democratic contender now, Kamala Harris."
"As Kelly Clarkson said, and all you'd ever hear me say is how I picture me with you."
"But it's really though that focus, like a bulldog on a bone of what Tim has done in Minnesota that we have to basically do across the country."
You can do so.
"And remember, at this point in 2020, Biden was actually up by seven there."
"I've really only voted once in my life, but I think I might vote this year."
"You might be able to win Nevada, but if you lose Wisconsin, it's over."
They've weaponized.
But nine out of ten Harris voters say that they are.
"I mean, this is about as close as it gets."
"But again, Trump can win the election without Pennsylvania."
Is that how this is gonna go?
The campaigns themselves basically have a different strategy.
I think that he can win in a statistical tie.
"And you can see on the averages, they weren't exactly, you know, massively in favor for Kamala Harris."
"And joining us now to dive into the most recent polls from Pennsylvania is Nathaniel Rakic, your senior elections analyst for ABC's 538."
We encourage our audience to engage with the electoral process actively.
"What is the key to winning, Pennsylvania?"
He's trying to distance himself from Harris very clearly.
He could be out there picking up litter trash.
"But this is huge, huge news."
They have to deal with the fact that there are some men in the country that it's a harder sell to them than a male candidate is.
Trump won a coin toss last week to decide podium placement or the order of the closing statements.
"Tucson, we do not need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails."
He won't back down and coming back here is very similar.
"Oh, the hot chocolate."
"Well, there you have it."
"Well, number one, they're entitled to housing benefits."
"Obviously, let's bring it down."
I've been laughing as Bob Woodward is a man of a certain generation.
Harris finished 2 points ahead of Trump in this poll.
And so that's why people like me are bothered when we see Donald Trump's unapologetic character flaws.
"Then in 2020, Joe Biden's 2.5 point victory marked the first time that Nevada voted to the right of the nation since the start of the 21st century, as Biden won the national popular vote by 4.5 points."
"Has Democratic messaging fallen flat on that or why is that, do you think?"
She doesn't do as well with men.
So here's the headline Quinnipiac poll September 18th.
"Looking at Wisconsin, as I felt will be closer and in my opinion, harder to win for Harris and likely win for Trump here, given how close it's been in the past with a large secret Trump vote out there."
"I think that's why it's, what does Trump use?"
I got you sir.
"Boy, oh boy, you gave us a comprehensive overview of all issues."
"Many of these voters, particularly in the eastern part of the state, were once part of the Democratic coalition but have shifted to the Republicans in response to Trump's populist economic message."
"But overnight, a draft report of the so-called air quotes audit by a group calling itself the Cyber Ninjas found that not only did Donald Trump lose Arizona, but he lost by even more votes than previously realized."
And abortion.
We see that Kamala Harris wins in this particular case.
It's very good work for the people that Kamala Harris traditionally doesn't give a shit about.
" With the US presidential elections just around the corner, opinion polls show Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in a tight race."
 Kamala's operation is being poorly run in the nation's biggest battleground.
"So like, yeah, we're all in the same boat here."
"If it wouldn't work for you, why should it work for the President of the United States?"
And people kind of just stood there.
Please roll the clip.
Now these color areas with the big numbers on them those are the congressional districts so for the purpose of the presidential election here let me show you the whole state maybe I can back out a little bit here.
Let's say a new poll says at 52 percent.
Calibration certification.
I'll be posting the Wisconsin and Michigan videos in a few days ahead of time.
"And look, there have been some really effective studies in Maricopa County on the vote."
And so this is really interesting here And so what we can see in this state also in the state of Pennsylvania was going to come really close is so there's this article It talks about how Pennsylvania slipping from Donald Trump's grasp and it says Kamala Harris gains ground with crucial Hispanic voters in swing state That could decide 2024 election.
And then he's swaying to Ave Maria and YMCA for about half an hour.
She'll continue to work it there.
"In a related context, Donald Trump, during an interview with Musk, reiterated his belief that the Ukraine invasion would not have occurred under his presidency, while simultaneously calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky honorable despite past controversies."
So get out there and talk to every single person you can about the importance of saving this country.
What are you hearing?
Scam Kinison has a few interesting tour dates on the calendar.
Trump most likely will be able to win this state by three to five percent points.
She is still leading in the national averages.
"Challenge them on the, these are racist."
Everybody knows that everyone sees through it.
I've decided.
So I will see you all later.
Just do it very slowly.
Let's put it that way.
"Unfortunately, we don't have that right now."
"A total of 538 electoral college votes are up for grabs, so a candidate needs to hit 270 to win."
Policies and the person.
"We don't have electric in this country, but we have all the gas you can use."
"Well, you know, look a couple things."
It's a more making it more personal and just like the attacks seem to be a negative thing.
"From Washington, D.C. today."
That three percent.
And so it's a huge amount when you think of kind of what we would call the Philadelphia media market minus Philadelphia.
"It shows Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by two points, with Harris polling at 49% and Trump at 47%."
"When you look at this, he could very well flip a county like Lackawanna County, which is where Scranton is."
Donald Trump refused to accept the results and unfortunately we have one of the world's great political parties which has followed him off of the ledge of this electoral lunacy.
"And in 2024, conservative groups have told Arizona officials they'll be monitoring, monitoring those drop boxes again."
"As you mentioned, when you have people like President Bill Clinton walk the American people through that, the Democrats put up 50 million jobs, the Republicans only one million over the last 20 some years."
Just 30 to 40% of Democrats were enthusiastic about Biden.
"It doesn't just impact the industry, which also has a couple hundred thousand people in it, but it also impacts farmers who have wells on natural gas wells on their property and those leases have put new life into their farms."
"For someone who has, um, you know, sort of claims to be doing good, but actually he's not, you know, he is tearing down the fabric of society."
"And if they're five percent, obviously that can make a difference in a state where the last two presidential racists came to a point or less."
I love Philly and Pittsburgh and they're an incredibly important part of our Commonwealth.
Inflation in Pennsylvania is actually higher than the national average.
"You buy a tank top or t-shirt, you can get a coffee mug, 20% off."
Then ask yourself this too while you're at it.
Polls saw for decades that they supported by two to one measures.
Simply wrong.
"Kalshi bettors say it will go below $45,000 by the end of August."
"And often without parental consent, can you even believe we're saying this?"
"Well, that's really not just a Tim Waltz thing."
Because that is still the perception some people have.
The other polls were Clifton plus nine Joe by seven.
We're going to make housing more affordable.
"I mean, this is night and day from what we saw at the RNC."
"The reasons are that Pennsylvania is a extremely diverse, extremely blue collar state, and is also a very large population."
Let me ask you about a specific issue that I know is important to your voters in Western Pennsylvania.
"He's fighting to protect you and your family, and he loves this country."
This is literally the fundamental values that made America what it is today.
We have a replacement for the machines.
I know a lot of people are pissed off at Republicans for not trying to pass that act earlier.
I gave him lunch.
"Color me, thunderstruck, she told the Post."
"I mean, obviously, I think PA might be the tipping point, so we can talk about that a little bit more."
But usually that's not going to happen.
"It tabulated more than 2 million votes in the last presidential election, but it took some time."
"My video this morning I said, I believe Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will win this state by one to two points, but right now, a four point margin isn't far out from where it's closer to be."
It's a daily news podcast from WITF where the only agenda is you.
"Well, that's great."
"And to your point, Haley has not made it seem that she wants her supporters to vote for Biden, although she also hasn't endorsed Trump."
"Only because their candidate, Kamala Harris, is an abject failure in and of herself."
"Her multiple trips to Pennsylvania, particularly to Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, are designed to keep Democratic voters energized."
"Vachow says his team will be targeting black, Hispanic and younger voters this cycle."
Kamala Harris must have Pennsylvania's 19 Electoral College votes.
Health issues is like three or four health problems combined with it.
I'm a she her woman everything.
" Essentially, if Biden loses Pennsylvania, the only way he could realistically even have a shot at the White House is he'd need to flip North Carolina."
They're trying to be appealing to a very narrow part of the base.
"So this key Eastern Pennsylvania, if we're going to see Trump win, he's going to have to flip some of these counties as in North Hampton, possibly knee high, possibly Monroe, possibly Nakawana and in Dufferin county."
It was a little depressing for a while there but I'm getting very excited now.
Look at this enthusiasm among Democrats is now at 85 percent.
"But Mahoning County, this is a county that is zooming to the right, it seems."
"Even Rasmussen's second to last poll, they had Biden up by three."
"She goes to the border, as literal borders are, and doesn't really want to take questions from journalists, of course, about this."
"Finally, the last poll in the image conducted by Patriot polling from September 27 to 29 with 816 registered voters shows Trump leading Harris by one point, polling at 50% compared to Harris's 49%."
"But you rather Trump than Harris, huh?"
"I mean, every time it happens, I'm still surprised."
"I mean, I think there's three races I'm keeping an eye on where I'm campaigning for these members."
"He said things he was going to do in 2015 and 2016, and then he did them."
That was $2.99 a gallon.
"Dan Barker, 71, is a former judge and member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."
He did.
"And then the campaign also cut, let's play a little bit of this ad that they turn around and cut immediately, hitting Trump on these comments."
"They want to make, he wants to make the country great again."
"But before he could appear in Tucson a second time, his campaign had to make a deposit of $145,000 up front."
Now they've got Harris plus two.
" Joining us now Jim Greenwood, co-chair of Republicans for Harris in Pennsylvania."
And here's a picture.
Vote for vote for what really makes sense.
That hurt.
"Now this lady, 60 years old has been a politician the whole life."
"Nate Silver calling out Alan Lichtman, actually."
"Take this guy, Arizona State Representative Mark Finch, I'm a publicly elected official."
Presumably thinking he's an easier general election opponent to overcome.
Like I thought you said it was close.
"Do you expect there's gonna be a big shift in the polls between now and November five, or is it going to stay as close as it is at the moment?"
And I know we're talking about VP picks on a video about rust belt polls.
"I know things can change but does this really look like an enthusiasm surge when the mail-in requests, they're trending Republican the total requests are weighed down and Republicans just raw vote wise they're they're up compared to 2022 while Democrats they're going to be above their numbers from 22."
So that was the power of abortion at that time.
"So listen, let me know what you think about this and what you think about them saying that this would have caused a civil war."
He is a Jewish American.
And Democrats strategists dismiss it away.
"I said, that was great."
"We got to look at the bigger picture, not just those top line numbers."
She's got a problem.
" Now, perhaps the single biggest lie that Harris told her in the debate on Tuesday, a little bit under the radar, it came toward the end of the night when she said, quote, I've made very clear my position on fracking."
"No, we're not getting the nice ones."
How is this?
It was a powerful display of unity and a strategic move by the Democratic Party to galvanize support.
"So in 2020, it took four days to call the election in Pennsylvania."
They talk about compassion.
"You're gonna hear a lot about Pennsylvania between now and Election Day, especially Allentown, located in Lehigh County, home of the Liberty Bell Museum, and if you're hungry, scrapple and cheese steaks."
"President on the ground bleeding from the back of his head, his ear, it looks like."
"Or certain voter demographics, or voter constituencies I should say, or being ignored and abused by the Democratic Party and misused."
Ryan made.
They should be something to celebrate.
"I mean, Dr. Oz needs to be pushed to the right, regardless, he'll probably win the primary at this point."
And it's amazing how quickly this can help if you just know what to avoid and the team at V Shred the team behind cutting edge fitness and nutrition strategies has created a free video that reveals exactly what this testosterone killing food is and how you can remove it from your body to increase your potential.
Sometimes you'll have days where Democrats do a little bit better.
They had clicked it up by nine points and granted it was in the middle of July.
"It reflects a larger trend within American politics, where urban centers, often pulsating with youthful energy and progressive ideals, clash with rural communities that may feel marginalized and economically left behind."
"They always mention, you know, it's a way of demeaning."
"Again, these are likely voters."
"But for his part, the Trump campaign telling us that the former president was simply trying to reaffirm his support for those fertility treatments and that he was simply making the comments in jest, Major."
"If it's worth saying, I think most of us can agree on is that these McDonald's fries are good."
"But fine, voter registration isn't everything."
"It was also some of the policies that came, the policy suggestions that came along with this ideology."
Royer.
So you're getting this back and forth as to whether or not those mics will be on.
Here are the matchup numbers and this set of 10 polls.
And that we know.
"We're seeing it happen at a very, very big rate."
Let us know in the comments below.
"Year one, you're going to make 60 to $70,000 to come into the energy industry, to be able to provide for their family, to be able to change the trajectory of their family and be the one that was able to do that."
How do some of these candidates at the state level feel?
So she's already down by two to three points and this is when she should be pulling her best.
Why have they gone silent?
"And I've said, I think that was a good thing to do it because it does neutralize somewhat the criticism that she's not really willing to wade into the arena or she lacks the confidence in her abilities to do that."
"Pennsylvania has a Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, who enjoys widespread popularity."
"And now they have it, Harris plus four."
"Evidence can be hearsay evidence, it's still evidence, but it's still hearsay."
"He will do what he can to put people back in jail and to turn this into a police state, because, as you said, he is a weak man who is relying on the military power and his ability to undermine others to prop himself up."
"Yeah, there's a pathway for Trump, not through Pennsylvania."
Because Michigan had been for some time fairly reliably blue.
This is not enough for Harris because the House is going to vote for Trump in that scenario.
She said Kamala has one big advantage.
Most people don't realize that they seem to think that there was a bigger margin for Biden in 2020 than there was for Clinton in Philadelphia.
We've taken on the big oil companies who are polluting.
It sounds like the name of a group of 12-year-old amateur detectives who give themselves.
"I mean, there's some differences here, but this is going to be an extremely close race."
"And for the first time being an adult, I've heard a president actually say that they care about the country."
We come by.
"This weekend, we heard some of his most alarming rhetoric yet framing his political opponents as criminals and enemies."
"And so when you're living this lie, when you're like acting out a part, and by the way, you're not a very good actor, you're going to have fails like what he had at the donut shop."
"We know nothing because in fact, reporters aren't allowed to come on to the floor of the Coliseum there that you're showing and report on what's going on."
"Just win Wisconsin, which I believe there's be a big point miss yet again there, and Nevada, which oddly enough is actually like Trump plus two in the RCP average, despite some wonky polls having him down by three or four."
Age and health in a 31 point lead.
Haskemilla Harris holding a narrow one point lead within the margin of error for most polls.
"I'm saying, forget it."
"You know, we oftentimes hear pundits or even campaigns talking about suburban women."
"Donald Trump in a lot of the Western Pennsylvania counties sees saw gains even in 2020, despite losing ground nationwide and losing ground in the state as a whole."
You're the worst vice president.
He's not being honest with himself.
Democrats think they could be key to reaching young voters and delivering a win in November.
That's in the corner down by Ohio and West Virginia.
"I don't know I'll just say this I don't I don't want to know politicians I don't want to have their phone numbers I don't want to be friends with them because if they have to come on this show, I'm not bringing friends on my show I don't want to do that."
"You know, if you commit your crimes in broad daylight, then it's okay."
It costs too much anyway.
He's been putting the blinders on and saying he's not going anywhere.
So what does that mean?
And that's where we were with Biden as the nominee on the day he dropped out.
The evidence showed that all these stories were fake.
"But President Trump conducting diplomacy with our enemies, I think was very was very important for for our country to maintain our status as the world's number one superpower."
So I have it on the tape.
I just don't think you're going to see Harris Harris point miss.
Hmm.
"It's in line with Atlas Intel, one of the most accurate pollsters in 2020."
"And it also, again, speaks to Nikki's Filipinos because if she wasn't able to sing, is she really Filipino?"
"This is the place that my parents first emigrated to, finding financial and social opportunity."
But I find it very strange that every pollster is finding the same result.
I think everybody knows it.
"So the Harris campaign at this point is on the defensive in a way, trying to get some of those crossover voters, perhaps, you know, she's going to be on stage with about 100 Republicans who are saying that they're going to vote for Harris."
"I think she's going to protect the rule of law, follow our constitutional process."
And these aren't just ancestral Democrats from Western PA becoming Democrats or Republicans now.
How is President Trump going to deliver?
"So Casey's been kind of flat, as you can see in the graph in front of you, but McCormick has been gaining, which of course is cause for concern for Democrats."
I don't You know people make everything about Trump supporters seem horrible and bad.
"Ryan Bowyer, who as the first blackhead of the city's building trades council, one of the most powerful labor leaders in the state, this guy says, I have concerns about Nikki Liu."
She looks like a fucking.
"And of course, it's one that I'm sure the campaigns have agonized over for months, trying to figure out if I'm in a debate, what am I going to say and do?"
And they do this.
"Instead, the organizers of this has said that you needed to sign up essentially to be a participant in it in order to in order to be able to witness what was happening."
We're going to take advantage of that.
We have them all.
The question is whether that enthusiasm will translate into enough votes to offset Harris' early voting lead.
Even better.
"Whereas the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to my knowledge, I don't think anybody suffered other than they've, you know, they've worked hard and they've done great things."
"Now they're pushing this misinformation campaign that Jill Stein is a Trump agent, and Jill Stein is only running the hurt camel."
He raised his fist in defiance and moved with the Secret Service detail to some type of motorcade vehicle and this rally has since ended.
It's like a thing on the left is funny.
"Like, who's paying for that study you just read about?"
Your thoughts on where the polling is at this stage of the election at this time?
That's a good catch.
Did you know that there are 33 million businesses in this country?
"If you guys did enjoy this video, smash the like button down below, subscribe, share with your friends, hit that little bell, follow the social media accounts in the description down below and of course, join the channel today."
"The filmmakers follow a formula, so there are some predictability factors, but they know how to tell a scary story that will make you, well, scream."
Kamala says things that we don't like.
"We can take a look, for example, at Michigan's race for for Gretchen Whitmer."
The point of a town hall meeting is to take questions.
Now they're doing a forensic audit of four counties.
"We've got the most accurate, most accurate, most accurate, most accurate, most accurate party ID popular vote model along with the most accurate just poll in general on the popular vote in 2020 for three straight months now saying Trump's plus three."
Her campaign emphasizes her commitment to issues like affordable child care and addressing income inequality.
"Yesterday, that push to restrict access to the ballot box ran into an unexpected roadblock."
There's a lot there that she can answer to.
Inflation has hit people hard.
"And with this question, the election is two weeks from today."
"Yeah, what is a tape?"
"And so you saw earlier up here, it's not just the Latinos, Latinx community that they're struggling with, maybe because they keep calling them Latinx."
Kamala Harris maintains this lead in a way that we haven't seen for Joe Biden at all this entire election cycle.
Kamala Harris most likely will win the state by barely under seven points.
He told me his understanding of blue ink was fine.
My heart is singing so loudly.
"You selected at that point, but not prior."
She's been leading in the five way for a little bit period of time.
Are you ready to do that?
"And as President, Kamala will never stop working to limit out-of-pocket costs and protect your care."
And he asked about my family.
"And what we have seen here is what appears to most people to be clearly violating the violating laws and clearly calling for interference into the into the election and warrants, absolutely warrants further investigation, regardless of anyone's party that's involved in this."
"Yes, they had to relocate for a period, and we had security around the clock for many months."
And what sounds like he's saying he's going to vote for Trump.
"Now, this is the same thing with Philadelphia and the suburbs."
You have to go to counties where it may not be easy to be a Democrat at times.
"We've both been prosecutors, both served as attorneys general."
"And while I do think that's entirely fair, right?"
"Tim Ryan was one of the few who challenged Nancy Pelosi, J.D."
There is truly a heartbeat.
"And if IVF is needed for that, then that is something that we need to protect and we need to make sure is available."
"It's false, but understand the context of it."
"And they can have a beer and talk about it, a piece of pizza, a pizza pie, and all get along."
And we had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist-pumping after getting shot.
"But what we know, based on data points, even before she announced Tim Wallace as the VP, and I do think he adds a lot, especially being from the Midwest, an election winner of 2020 and 2022 rather in 2018, he does well in the state, is that Pennsylvania, right now I have as a lean Democratic state, I do believe Kamala Harris and Tim Wallace can win it."
There's no way he wins Pennsylvania by two to three.
But they would say we're going to stop Magga.
Think about that.
Harris campaign is trying to address that as well.
"Well, at the rally today, Elon Musk is expected to be there."
I'm sure a lot of them may come home to Trump.
"And listen, I'm so excited to be here."
"For some reason, the governor of South Dakota who killed her dog, Kristi Noem, is the one asking Donald Trump questions."
"They don't want the simple message that Donald Trump is awful, which he is."
"What's your betting line here, Mike?"
"Voting rights and democracy, women's rights, workers rights, you could add to that list, obviously."
"The week before the DNC, she came to Pennsylvania and she didn't go to Philly or Pittsburgh."
I'm Ben Mysalis from the Midas Touch Network.
"He is very pro-Israel, which may alienate some of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party that has obviously a very anti-Israel stance amid the war in Gaza."
He's a patriotic American.
What's the mood there and what have you heard?
"On that Senate race, no comment, Rachel, on the Twitter back and forth."
I could stand here with him all night long.
And who can really say what's going to happen?
 Well today former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are back on the campaign trail Trump will hold a press conference in Los Angeles County this afternoon before heading to Las Vegas for a rally this evening Harris is back in Pennsylvania today stopping first in Johnstown before holding a rally later this evening in Wilkes-Barre We have team coverage this morning with CBS News campaign reporters Zach Hudak and Olivia Rinaldi I want to start with Zach who is covering the Harris campaign for us from Washington So Zach Harris's event in Pennsylvania tonight.
"She's always sort of, for months she has been arguing that former President Trump is unfit."
And I know this is more liberal leaning.
"These measures include the initiative launched by the administration of Vice President Joe Biden to regulate the price of insulin and other drugs that save lives, to put an end to jump fees at banks, and to regain the 800,000 manufacturing jobs that were lost during previous economic downturns."
"The more you look at this, the more you realize, wait, this source from NBC News, which it's very strange it came from NBC News."
Yeah that's absolutely true.
"And in this case, 75,000."
"He might be able to bring like a health care plan to the table that Republicans could use to win over some like single issue health care voters who usually don't vote Republican, but are like culturally conservative and like the Midwest."
We can authorize a hearing off campus.
He doesn't have to win it to win the state.
"The difference in the national at the national level with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, and even in races like mine or congressional races, people know there's a basic difference between the two candidates."
Hi.
She saw Pennsylvania.
"They also look at messaging as far as Republicans and what they've been able to do in areas like South Florida where you've got large Cuban immigrant populations, you've got large Venezuelan immigrant populations, and their messaging on items such as socialism has been quite effective when it comes to Latino voters."
And the fake news didn't pick it up.
"Can you tell me about that, what the campaign is saying this morning about what the former president was signaling?"
"Yeah, this is a place that the former president said will be the safest place on earth, he's been saying, in his rallies, as the chairman of the House Task Force."
"Thank you for the great question, but unfortunately, I do not speak to fake news."
Good for a fair time this time of year.
You think that's a fluke?
Glad to be here.
Please like and subscribe and leave a comment below.
"That's why I've said over and over again that this is an election which is about one word, rights."
"The interesting thing is Bob Casey, the incumbent Democrat, still holds a 5% lead against the challenger in Pennsylvania in this poll, all right?"
"Your state is always in the crosshairs, every presidential election that I can remember."
I have no clue.
It could be one reason but also having a difficult time with African American folks with black men in particular.
That really have sent them into a tailspin.
"But on the other hand, it's sort of normalizing and routinizing this endless relitigation to a degree that is if elections aren't really resolved."
Harris is also having formal interviews with candidates who have not been confirmed in the media both in person and virtually according to a source.
"Will the energy behind abortion, do you think, ultimately decide who wins Congress?"
"Overall, the average of the last 10 or so polls shows Harris is only up 1%, as compared to President Joe Biden."
So we'll see what happens guys.
"And Joe actually on stage and I was like, you knew all the facts."
He's a misogynist.
We can see it in her own favorability rating numbers.
"What do you wish, based on what you've heard tonight, that Carson and Faith understood about you, your side?"
UConn's men and women's teams are both in the Final Four.
"No, it's true because even Biden, he didn't win that county, Luzerne County, but he did better than Hillary did."
"So we had to add a separate kind of just grassroots event where people could come out, we can meet them."
"The strongholds, Chris Cox."
But he most obviously does not need this state.
He survived two assassination attempts.
"It got really bad around the time of the Afghanistan withdrawal, but even before then, she started to see a dip in approval, and she was unfavored pretty much nationwide."
It's like the only MLK line Republicans have ever read.
But you know what?
I haven't seen nothing done.
"Where I am in San Francisco, homelessness has become a real problem."
This is the first batch presidential fries.
Trump stopped taking questions during those times requesting Ave Maria be played the first time an instrumental version came on.
So it is right to look for other forms of external validation about where the race is going.
I'm sure later tonight I'll be on going over more details.
"Foreign policy can get you in trouble as a presidential candidate, but seldom does it win you votes."
"It's not everything, which I'm not denying."
The three things she's looking for competence character and core values and she has to have a personal connection and relationship with that person.
And that's with a Democrat pollster and PPP.
My daughter doesn't like to go to very many political events but she wanted to come to this one because it's we just witnessed the first female president of the United States that's what I think we have in Kamala Harris and I also think this is it's a role model for all girls and women in this country.
We're exhausted after this but I think it's going to be a little more smooth sailing that we have a better idea of how to drive the test.
"But I know if Kamala gets in, we're going to have World War III."
He then lies about crowd sizes in speeches that he gave many months ago.
They are Republican leading voters that more than likely they're going to break for Trump.
"But looking at those numbers, it doesn't really matter who's the most popular."
"Yes, absolutely."
We're going to watch and see if anybody talks about it tonight.
"The group claims to have about 700,000 people who support it."
Michael Ruhle did alright.
Unbelievable.
"For starters, just look at voter registration."
"And why does it matter, Jeff?"
"So we know that the establishment and Nancy Pelosi, their plan was actually not to pick Kamala Harris and what ended up happening."
"She could still lose, but she will still be in a position."
"And I assume a lot of people in the district didn't know either, but this is the latest coat."
Absolutely I'm upset about all of my election bills dead.
You can tell from that last exchange how it's possible to have a civil dialogue with people you disagree with.
"So as of right now, as of July 12, 2024, Donald Trump has a 4% need in the combination of polls."
And won't destroy democracy and take away women's rights.
"Isabella Martinez â€“ $1,500,000 Isabella Martinez, a biotech billionaire from Harrisburg, has made a $1.5 million contribution to Harris' campaign."
That's down a whopping 46% from 2020.
Why would it then get cut down to half a million from 1.4 million and vote in advantage in 2020?
"With the election just weeks away, is there enough time for the Harris campaign to salvage their chances in Pennsylvania?"
"Joining us now is Jen Fifield, reporter for the Arizona Republic, who has had a most unusual day of reporting."
It's reminding everyone about her nutty anti-fracking stance.
So I can't explain it.
"So not only is this photo block much more Republican, there's just less votes here."
I guess you could argue that's a possibility.
And I get like being newer to politics and hearing people talk about certain things and not knowing what it means.
"Pennsylvania is seen as pivotal for both sides, $500 million in TV ads."
"The good news is, I think Democrats and independents and a big number of Republicans are going to move beyond that and just get out and vote."
We want to get to a point where Kamala Harris's bad decisions is something she can deal with.
"Now, I know a lot of people are out there saying, whoa, what if he would have picked Josh Shapiro?"
"Charlie, the vice president sat down with a local affiliate, I think outside Philadelphia today or Philadelphia affiliate while she was in the state and gave an interview."
If we look at those clips that I just showed you and say that person should be nowhere near the nuclear codes should be nowhere near a position of power that Donald Trump is someone who should be absolutely disqualified for being anywhere near any position of power because of his own behavior.
So here we have Trump at plus three in Arizona.
This is probably more probable than winning Michigan.
Likely voters now see little daylight in most cases between Harris and Trump on who can best handle those key issues.
And talk about timing.
"And that's always, always, always, always an added benefit, because the VP at net balance should just never, never, never be taking away from a ticket."

"Well, you know, it's an interesting question."
Let's talk about fracking because we're here in Pennsylvania.

 new polling out of the key battleground state of Pennsylvania.
You're ready for action.
"And I don't even know what he's even saying here because, again, he's really mentally having real issues."

"Now, do not boo."
"That's what stood out to me, Sean, was it felt like incompetence to try and make this an issue after the way we withdrew from Afghanistan."

That exploded with Donald Trump.
Just look inside of it.
All labor.
Forty seven versus six for Harris.
Now it's Harris plus 11.
But there were some medical incidents in the crowd.
I just always want you to remember that and we're not going to be gas lighted.
Did God protect any of them?
"The question is, will Harris's surge in Pennsylvania be enough to counterbalance Trump's strength in Florida?"
Maybe you're sick.
I mean there are a lot of women out there who are who are you know put off by Trump's personality or are concerned about abortion.
"What are you seeing, Sean, in terms of the the ad spend on television?"

"And because of this realignment that we're seeing by education in this country, and who the low propensity voters are, you know, they're doing a 180."
None of this is a surprise.

"So yeah, man, Obama about to talk shit about Trump."
"Kamala Harris is so at 191 electoral votes, filled in for the vice president, both with the solid and probable states currently."
Maybe it's a fluke.
Indicating a consolidation of support that once leaned towards third-party candidates or was undecided.
That's what I think about these days.
"And that's why you're seeing the Republicans who are actually involved in the election coming out and saying, no, none of this is true."
Kamala Harris is in a strong position for this election.
But I think it's a good thing that we're going back to the presidential election.
She's not intelligent.
I highly recommend it.
How did people respond?
The VPs visit here leaving a lasting impact.
"I mean, you have there is an alternative out there, but Democrats are saying, most Democrats are saying that's a distraction."
Unemployment remains low.
"Of course, all of these outrageous bad faith misrepresentations of what Dr. King said are happening as Republicans led by Trump are actively engaged in attempts to suppress votes and subvert future elections."
The Detroit economic one.
That whole city was dead.

"Like Dolores Cole, we met her at that Republican event."

And they keep track of how many votes come in every single day.
He can't help himself.
"Yeah, that's a question we've had in Arizona and other states where ballot measures are on the same ballot as the presidential race."
Hit that little bell.
"Now, there may be a reason for that."
Right now I don't see much with Senator Casey.
But everybody gets along and can talk about this.
And Trump has this approach to endorsing which is very controversial.
He may even have some supporters who feel more strongly about him than they do about Kamala Harris.
"Again, Harris isn't actually trying to reach Trump voters at this point."
You're right.
"Amy, I'm going to start with you."
They didn't kill him yet.
"There are just under 600,000 Labor Union members in Michigan, about 800,000 here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and in what is expected to be a very close race, maybe even closer than 2020, both campaigns know every vote counts."

You had to go through metal detectors.
"You reconstruct it, so to speak."
John Fetterman went on to to say he was going to vote for Donald Trump.

"I'm like, okay, so here's the deal."
Immigration is another hot-button issue.
"Here's a sample to the question of, did yesterday's verdict swing you one way or another?"

"So whether this election is making you feel excited or scared or hopeful or frustrated or anything in between, do not just sit back and hope for the best."
We'll see.
It's a lot more of a state issue.
Now they have Trump up by two.
And what else do you think he brings to the ticket?
She sucks.
"I m General MacArthur, but th a tough guy."
"Looking at Pittsburgh, it was 55.9 for for Clinton, 39.5 for Trump."
"If you want to stay friendly with people, you don't talk about politics."
Two men investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela are charged with capital murder and the death of Jocelyn Nunnaray.
"She brought that ticket to talk over at dinner, but insists what's really important is just that people vote."
I did have a conversation with the president.
Unraveling surprising shifts that could change the course of this historic election.
And it's also a way for them to sort of show their loyalty to the former president.
I was very impressed by her energy and how much she's kind of grown as a candidate.
"So I think the questions about Donald Trump's ability to perform the job for the four years, based on the statements and the ways conducted himself throughout the campaign, it was a critical point for Joe Biden, who had a very difficult debate performance back in June."
"And Pennsylvania was ultimately decided by a very narrow 80,000 votes with the mail-in ballots and everything else that was going on."
"Yeah, we should put some balloons."
"Why did you feel either in the absence of that evidence or with it, what they were asking you to do would violate your oath to the Constitution?"
So do you have anything to add to the people that you want to let them know about anything at all?
It was the only election of the four that the Keystone State went Republican.
This is the Doug Tenapl Channel.
"In Erie, that is one of the so-called pivot counties in Pennsylvania."
Harris's focus on labor issues and economic recovery may help solidify her support in this demographic.
I'm not an expert on the production of oil and all that.
Let's have some real talk here.
And that's what this campaign is about.
" Hello, Tucson!"
Hold on real fast.
"As you could see what you see in the speeches of the leaders who are trading barbs at each other, making personal attacks, calling each other dangerous, the enemy within, calling them rabid, Donald Trump calling Kamala Harris rabid leftist, using that kind of language, threatening to deploy national guard, which is an empty threat though, because he's not the United States president."
That's really good stuff.
"Yeah, you'll see this is shaping up to be a Donald Trump victory."
This campaign for us is really born out of love of country.
This is Inside the Right.
It's where the great American West became the American dream.
But Trump is not backing down.
"I'd probably vote for her in the primary at this point, but it is what it is."
And so you stepped into my frame.
And I think that Trump wins.
And God bless local journalism.
"If there's still response bias, even then, if Trump's winning in the RCP average come September, which is entirely possible, Harris is cooked."
"The big problem is, is that I'm not sure debates have the impact that they used to, especially when in this case there is no newcomer."
And it's going to be very fun to beat Kamala Harris on November the 5th.
"The idea he'll be able to crack 50 in any of them is pretty low odds, I would say."
"But when Kamala Harris stepped into the ring as the Democrats presidential nominee, the gap began to close between her and Trump."
"Specifically, the court rejected a challenge brought by Democratic officials aimed at eliminating the mandate that mail-in ballots must be dated and submitted by certain deadlines."
So you could see Kamala Harris kind of barely hanging on with like this point seven point eight lead.
"And as the Biden Harris headquarters pointed out on the right, this is Donald Trump spending today bragging about ending Roe v Wade on the left."
But there's also a heavier Arab American presence in Michigan than in most other states.
Polity and like women's rights I feel like is a big issue.
"Now, I never heard Kamala come in and say, do you mean fracking to Joe?"
"They were coming in through a system that we had, which was great because I'm the best thing that ever happened to farmers."
Pro l and they don't want any t They're just all in for t are.
Good luck keeping up with all the delivery demands.
That is awful and other states.
Look at that Trump.
So it's kind of like a mixed bag in that department.
We will stop the invasion.
"But will this string of non-answers on 2020 or Trump's rhetoric that we're hearing, does any of that do damage with the average voter?"
The court's decision could amplify calls for the Democrats to support measures that enhance election transparency and to address any perceived weaknesses in the electoral system.
"Trump won in two polls, but Harris gained a slight edge in four polls."
"And when you take a look at the numbers from the New York Times and Quinnipiac University and Franklin and Marshall, they all provide an individual lens that help us understand this race from multiple perspectives, from multiple different pollsters."
But what's different now like especially looking at the House is that the the makeup of the Republican Conference is far more Trump aligned and Trump comfortable now compared to in 2017 when you have a lot of House Republicans who had been there and even newer House Republicans who are rejecting kind of Trump's economic message.
We do.

The Bronx is the most democratic and still drawing a big crowd.
"According to CNN here, it has Republicans plus one."
Maybe it was July or and then Kennedy died on the other end.
"I parked somewhere and I walked and I was like, I'll get to the end of the line."
"Yeah, that's what both campaigns are seen as of now."
"If they're concerned about issues like immigration, ask him, well, what do you think he's going to do?"
"And the more people that bank their vote, the more surgical we can use our resources to direct people, low propensity voters on election day to get out."
That's the end.
"The legal victory serves as a testament to Trump's ability to navigate and influence legal and political processes, which can enhance his appeal to voters who value these qualities."
Blood coming down the face.
"That comes from almost 90, 95% of crime statistics."
And so this is the kind of message that she's taking to these redder areas where Donald Trump may have won to help grow her support and hopefully put her over the edge in these battleground states.
So always good when you guys are able to stay on the road there.
"Every time there's a new update, it gets even worse for Democrats like okay fine."

He wants to make it great.
Now I don't know if you're there.
And in doing that he got shot in the face.

"Yeah, we saw that, it was a good interview."
"Yes, abortion is in there somewhere, but it's not as important of an issue as it was in 2022, which again, you had a lot of gubernatorial races."

"Again, what does that mean?"
He's great.

"Yeah, I mean, I think Pennsylvania is absolutely a must-win state for Joe Biden in particular."
"Today, we spoke with voters who are mostly in favor of a Harris-Shapiro ticket, while others just want the governor to finish out leading the Commonwealth."

What exactly are we seeing here?
This man's life is in jeopardy.
That's been huge.
"Harryann, great to see you as always."
The president?
You had President Biden in Michigan yesterday as these calls continue to grow from some members within his own party.

He is ready to be reinstated as president.
"How is the Democratic Party situated with Kamala Harris at the top to prosecute the case that her candidacy for the presidency is not just necessary because of the opponent that she's running against, but because of standing in the breach on behalf of people will make a difference for them when it matters in 26, 27, and 28."

Pennsylvania is.
"And then you'll see that the rest of the quote says, this note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

"The story was real because I'm guessing liberals knew the higher up Democrats knew that the story, the Hunter Biden laptop story was what the Republicans were sitting on because of course it's going to get released a few weeks before the election."

Harris's doctor released a letter Saturday summarizing her medical history and status.

Journalists whose stories he doesn't like.
"There were red hats, there was chanting, there was pointing and booing of the press where we were sitting."
"What are some of the stories that your residents, your constituents have told you, just, you know, one or two or three, even from your own family, if you don't mind?"

This isn't John Fetterman saying he's going to vote for Trump.
"I mean, look at the then partisanship if she gets elected, it's all out the window."
I think Wilkes-Barre.

Do you guys think this was the right move for Trump?
"It took more than six weeks for Harris and Walz to sit down for their first official interview, which aired as a pre-taped segment with CNN's Dana Bash on Thursday."
That's helpful with raising a national profile.

Trump finished two points ahead of Harris in this poll.
"The good news is our courts here in Pennsylvania, just in recent days, have consistently in their rulings sided on enfranchisement, not the kind of disenfranchisement that Donald Trump pushed for back in 2020 and is again threatening this time."
They have a lot of arrogance in their campaigning and their entire existence.
And I think that's what Josh Shapiro and I have been doing.
"So we have more women than men, more rich people than Trump's base and whites."

She was polling.
"That's a big question, because another poll, this ABC Ipsos poll, who looked across the high contenders for the Veep stakes here, none of them really have national name recognition."
Pennsylvania lawmakers heavily criticized Shapiro for his handling of the scandal and Republicans questioned why Verb was permitted to remain in his position for months after the accuser came forward.

There is no mountain we cannot climb.
Let me repeat that.
What's your sense today as the voting is going to end and as we're going to see who's going to win this race?
"That shit is gone, dude."
It's the laugh of a lunatic.

It's killed cylinder.
And it's an active investigation that's going on now that we're going to put out our own report as to what happened that day.
I agree.
Watch the look on her face here as he as he wraps up.
Harris's stance back then was loud and clear.
And we have Republican elected officials who simply put are not willing to speak truth to their own constituents.
"Yes, they're making it worse and people should get vaccinated."

"They want to hear from their president, Trump."
The legal victory in Pennsylvania could have broader implications beyond the state itself.

"And so they also found that amongst voter demographics, Kamala Harris performed better than Biden did with key Democratic coalitions, doing better amongst black voters in these swing states and younger voters, and also gaining ground with older voters that can explain why Kamala Harris is ahead by four points when Biden only won Wisconsin by one, or Pennsylvania by one, or Michigan by three."

And Donald Trump just started to ask for music to be played instead and then he danced.
This comes just months after he was convicted on gun charges in a separate case.

Favorability ratings 48% favorable opinion of Harris while 43 unfavorable.

You'll see both candidates in split screen and you'll see what those comparisons are.
"And then if you're just joining me here, the reason I did this video is that Kamala Harris got really good polling Quinnipiac swing state polling that she's leading in Pennsylvania, 51, 45 over Trump leading in Michigan, 50 to 45 Wisconsin, according to Quinnipiac is much closer."

"So Pennsylvania appears to be kind of the main battleground state, although because of the emergence of the Sun Belt, it's actually neutered sort of the impact of Pennsylvania potentially, especially with the in play of North Carolina."

What are the plans?
Trump's record is a disaster.
The unwavering Trump supporter challenged the state's election results in a lawsuit.
"So just to be clear, you will go to Chicago to be a part of the convention."
"So if she was to nominate him to be the VP, that would probably hurt her more nationally, even if it would give her a bit of a boost in Pennsylvania, which is probably why they selected the Kami teacher, quote unquote, from Minnesota by way of Nebraska and Tim Walts."

"I mean, 80,000 votes separated Trump and Biden."
"We're going to see these two square off in what is really going to be a fundamental race that really has an eye on the democracy at large and a potential certification of the 2024 presidential election results, which that responsibility lies with the governor here in the state of Arizona."

"And, and listen, this isn't like three or four years ago."
"When you believe in what we need to do to lift up the middle class, you fight for the middle class."
What do you ask Vice President Harris?
"Very true because the way he approached things, we had our friends respecting us, enemies fearing us, but even people like Putin and G, you think a little rocket man in North Korea was actually brought President Trump over the 38th parallel, the first president to do that."
Two voters and voter group analysis.
Look at the total request in 2020.
Finally.

"And then you were at this rally that the new Vice Presidential nominee, Tim Walz, and Vice President participated in Philadelphia and it certainly seemed to be allowed an enthusiastic crowd."

"Well, I mean, she didn't want to."
"So, more people likely would have been hurt or killed and the election, the proceedings would have been stopped."

"We covered this yesterday, but because it's your state, I want to show you Secretary Hobbs this exchange between Jamie Raskin and Andy Biggs."
One of Donald Trump's top surrogates also posted the following.
It does look like it's truly an effort just to win over this one segment of voters.
"And then to put your fucking head down and lecture black men about how we need to vote for her just because she's black, which is identity politics to the fullest."
"For Trump, Pennsylvania holds personal significance."
But Trump is winning big among older voters here.
"Some of the more egregious things we've seen, Arizona."
