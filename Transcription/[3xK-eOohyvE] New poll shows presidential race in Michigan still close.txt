 exclusive polling to share it this morning. This information came out a few minutes ago. And here with the latest numbers on key races is political reporter Rick Albin. The new WOOD TV Emerson College The Hill poll shows the race for president in Michigan is still close, but it's changed since last month when Vice President Kamala Harris led former President Donald Trump by three points 50 to 47. Our new poll shows Harris has slipped a point, notably falling below 50% to 49% while Trump remains at 47. So the race is even closer. The poll was done from September 15th through 18th. 875 likely voters were asked to participate with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2%. In the same polling, voters were asked about the open US Senate seat and in that race, Democrat Alyssa Slotkin had 47% of the vote, Mike Rogers had 42%. Slotkin remains the same in the race as Rogers picked up one point, 11% are still undecided. A poll is a snapshot of a moment in time and gives us an idea about both of these races that remain tight and with less than seven weeks until election day and early voting, starting in just days, we'll continue to follow these evolving numbers on your local election headquarters. I'm Rick Albin.
