 According to Arizona Christian University's Cultural Research Center, many Christians feel a declining interest in politics. Two-thirds of potential non-voters cite this lack of interest. Dissatisfaction with both main candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, is also a major factor, with 57 percent saying neither aligns with their values. This trend could significantly impact the election. Polster George Barna urges pastors to remind congregants that voting is both a civic and biblical duty. Dr. Jeff Myers, president of Summit Ministries, underscores the Christian responsibility to engage in politics, emphasizing constitutional principles like life, liberty, and property. Remember, your vote shapes our future. Don't sit this one out. For more Christian news, subscribe to our newsletter.
