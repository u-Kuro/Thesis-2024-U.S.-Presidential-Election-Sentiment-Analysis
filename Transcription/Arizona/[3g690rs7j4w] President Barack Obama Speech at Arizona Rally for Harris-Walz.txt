Are you ready to go? It is good to be back It is good to be back in Arizona is good to be back in Tucson And I I appreciate y'all coming out the day before homecoming As we landed we saw Colorado's buses at the airport And I know, you know, Colorado's got a couple good players, but I Also know you guys have beaten them twice in a row. So don't bet against the Wildcats tomorrow Come on I Love you back I Am not here just to talk about football I Am here to ask you to vote For my friend and your outstanding congressman Raul Grijalva For your next member of Congress from the 6th district Kirsten Engel for Your outstanding next United States senator Ruben Gallo And for the next president of the United States Kamala Harris Now before I get going You guys have to you guys have to forgive me Because let's face it. I'm a little out of practice So I got a little something in my throat But that's okay because What I have to say is gonna make so much sense that even if I'm Coughing a little bit. I think I'm you're still gonna catch what I'm saying here because Here in Arizona voting has already started You can you can vote early or return your mail ballot today There's no reason to delay what you waiting for And of course you can vote at your polling place on Election Day November 5th C-C-P-O-D-A just remember to bring your photo ID And I think as Ruben mentioned C-C-P-O-D-A but but as Ruben mentioned you need to make a plan and and if you've got any confusion any any Uncertainty about what your plan is to vote then you go to I will vote comm A-Z and Then once you've got a plan then you got to make sure your friends and family make a plan to vote, too Because together we've got a chance to choose a new generation of leadership in this country And start building a better and stronger and fairer and more hopeful America Now Wait, we know we know this election is going to be tight And and it's gonna be tight because a lot of Americans are struggling right now As a country we've been through a lot over the last few years We've had a historic pandemic that wreaked havoc on communities and businesses Disruptions from the pandemic then caused prices to spike and that put a strain on family budgets and in a lot of ways it felt like the aspirations of working people Have taken a backseat to the priorities of the rich and the powerful and the well-connected So So I understand why people are looking to shake things up. I get why sometimes folks are frustrated with politics I'm Sometimes frustrated with politics So so so I get it What I cannot understand Is why anyone would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you? That I don't understand Because Because there is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody but himself I I've said it before Donald Trump is a 78 year old billionaire Who has not stopped whining about his problems? Since he wrote down that golden escalator nine years ago And when he's not complaining he's trying to sell you stuff He's got his gold sneakers He's got the hundred thousand dollar watch Says it's a Swiss watch, but but nobody can actually figure out where in Switzerland was this thing made? He's got This is my favorite. He's got the Trump Bible Wants you to buy the Word of God Donald Trump edition Donald Trump edition his name is gonna be on there embossed right now right right next to the Luke and Mark and Matthew right And by the way, I will give you one guess you could not make this stuff up where these Bibles are made So Mr. Tough guy on China except when he can make a few bucks Hawken his Trump edition Bibles. Come on, man You can't make this stuff up But he's doing it And the reason he's doing it is because what he cares about is his ego and his money and his status He's not thinking about you Donald Trump sees power as nothing more than a means to his ends He wants the middle class to pay the price for another huge tax cut that would mostly help him and his country club buddies He doesn't care if he costs more women their pre reproductive freedoms because it won't make a difference in his life Do not boo vote They can't hear you when you boo but when you vote everybody can hears you Vote Most of all most of all Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them Between the quote real Americans which by which he means his supporters And and the outsiders who don't support him because having people divided and angry and Agreeved and resentful he figures that boosts his chances to get elected Now so so those are his intentions I Do have to point out that along with his intentions there is also a question of his competence Have you seen him lately? I Mean he is out there. He's given two two and a half hour speeches just word salads You you have no idea what he's talking about. He's talking about Hannibal Lecter. He's talking about this he's talking about that He held a town hall meeting Where he's he just Let me explain because I've done a lot of town hall meetings the point of a town hall meeting Is to take questions He just decided you know what I'm gonna stop taking questions and then he's swaying to Ave Maria and YMCA for about half an hour folks are standing there not sure what's happening Can you imagine if if if I did that Can you imagine if Ruben did that right in the middle now our playlist would probably be better but He called himself the father of IVF I do not know what that means You do not either He said January 6th was a day of love Do not boo vote It may January 6th sound like it was Woodstock You You would be worried if your grandpa was acting like this No, no, I'm not joking you would right You'd be you'd call up your cousins and you say have you noticed? So Imagine it coming from a guy who wants to be given unchecked power Tucson we do not need to see what an older Lunar Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails We have had enough of arrogance and bumbling and bluster and division America's ready to turn the page. We're ready for a better story We are ready for a president Kamala Harris I warned you I gotta go ahead and chant that And the good news is Kamala Harris is ready to do the job This is a leader who has spent her life Fighting on behalf of people who need a voice who need a champion Somebody was raised in the middle class Believes in the values that built this country Worked her way through college in McDonald's Served with distinction in every office. She has ever held who is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president Has ever been That's who Kamala is And in the White House she will have an outstanding partner in Governor Tim Walz Love that dude Tim's a veteran. He's a teacher. He's a coach He's a hunter Been a great governor working with Democrats and Republicans to get stuff done And I learned the other day he can take a vintage truck apart and put it back together again Which is just cool You think Donald Trump can do that For that matter do you think Donald Trump has ever changed the tire in his life Yeah, you know he's like He's like having Jeeves change his time The point is I was just picturing it The point is if you elect Kamala and Tim They will not be focused on their problems. They will be focused on yours They Understand that too many folks not just here in Arizona, but across the country are still struggling to pay the bills Even though wages are steadily growing even though inflation is finally slowing The price of everything from health care to housing to groceries. It's still too high and it hurts So The question is not whether or not We need to do some things different. The question is who's really gonna do something about it So so what we need to do is to evaluate the plans of the respective candidates Donald Trump's plan is to give another massive tax cut to billionaires and big corporations Now don't do not boo Vote I'm gonna break you of this habit Now Some people I because you know, I'm having conversations around the country of folks as I go campaigning And I'll hear some people say, you know, well, I Remembered the economy when when those first two years with Trump they were pretty good And I Say yeah, yeah, it was good because it was my economy that I gave to him I Had spent the previous eight years Cleaning up the mess that Republicans had left me So When I handed over the economy to Donald Trump We had had 75 straight months of job growth and I said here you go And all he did with it was give a tax cut to people who did not need one And drove up the deficit in the process and now he wants to do it again Now In fairness His other big economic plan Is to slap tariffs on? Everything from food to TVs now Understand a tariff is any imported good. You just slap an extra cost on it And if some other countries not playing fair in terms of trade then you use it as a tool in your tool belt But this is basically a Trump sales tax That could cost the average family almost four thousand dollars a year This is not a plan to bring down prices if you think prices are high now Donald Trump's messages you ain't seen nothing yet When it comes to health care Donald Trump's got one answer and that is and Obamacare Get rid of the Affordable Care Act Even though 45 million people rely on it Couple a couple of weeks ago his running mate had the nerve the hood spot To say that Donald Trump Salvaged the Affordable Care Act what? Donald Trump spent his entire presidency trying to dismantle it and he couldn't even do that, right? Thanks to John McCain he didn't do it And now Eight years after he was elected after all the arguments against Obamacare have been proven to be wrong and Even folks who don't like me sure like that insurance When he was asked about it he said well I Have a concept of a plan for how I might replace it Now I want you to think about that Let's say let's say your boss Gives you an assignment Says she needs it by Friday Friday rolls around your boss says so did you finish that project I asked for? Well, I haven't actually started but I do have a concept of a plan Students here at Arizona you could try it with your professors Now your papers do and And and you just write on a sheet of paper concept of a plan You could try it at home honey, did you do the dishes I have a concept of a plan to do the dishes Haven't done them yet How's that gonna go over? If it wouldn't work for you Why should it work for the president the United States? But the good news is that Kamala Harris does not have Concepts of a plan she has an actual plan to make your life better So to bring down the cost of things like groceries she'll go after Corporations that are jacking up prices just like she went after Big banks and for-profit colleges when she was Attorney General in California And believe me when when when Kamala does nobody's gonna want to stand in her way. I've witnessed it. I Remember after the home mortgage crisis Kamala pushed me in my administration harder than any other Attorney General in the country to make sure homeowners got a Fair settlement and it didn't matter that I was a Democrat She wasn't gonna let anything stop her from winning as much relief as possible for the families who deserved it That's who she is. That's the kind of president Kamala Harris will be To lower housing costs Kamala is gonna cut red tape and Work with state and local governments as well as the private sector to build 3 million new homes concrete plans She'll give first-time homebuyers up to $25,000 to help them with a down payment concrete plans to lower health care costs Kamala already worked with Joe Biden to take on the drug companies bring down the cost of insulin hearing aids more than 50 prescription drugs Ruben worked on that he knows about it and as president Kamala will never stop working to limit out-of-pocket costs and protect your care concrete plans. That's who Kamala is And instead of giving more tax cuts to billionaires and people who don't need them and Raising prices on working families Kamala is going to give a tax cut to 100 million middle-class and working people here in America so if you're a new parent You could qualify for a six thousand dollar tax credit during the first year of your child's life That will help because raising kids is hard She wants to make it easier to afford stuff like a crib or a car seat or diapers You think down trumps ever change the diaper no Jeeves Jeeves what is this? If you're starting a small business Kamala Harris will give you a $50,000 tax credit to help you get it off the ground She believes in entrepreneurship That's who Kamala is that's what she stands for not concepts of a plan actual plans Now If you challenge Trump or Jd Vance on these quote-unquote concepts They'll fall back on One final answer. This is their go-to After everything else Makes no sense They'll go and it doesn't matter what the issue is housing health care education paying the bills He'll blame immigrants He wants you to believe That if you let him round up Whoever he wants and ship them out All your problems will be solved Now wait, hold on a second because this is a serious piece of business Arizona's a border state You know There are real issues at the border. We can't pretend there are not we are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants we were built on Immigrants looking for a better life. We also have to make sure that the system works the way it was supposed to right, so So we have a real problem to solve But Remember Donald Trump was president for four years He likes to talk about Kamala being vice president for years. We remember you being president buddy for four years and if rounding up and deporting millions of desperate people many of them women and children is the answer to everything Looks like we might need an EMT right in front here. Everybody bend your knees real quick Because sometimes when you stand too long you get a little faint. Nope. She'll be alright Just got to make sure and drink your drink something if you got it. All right. Good job EMTs So so the question is Why didn't why didn't he Actually solve the problem when he was in power Why was the number of undocumented immigrants basically the same when he left office as when he took office? I'll tell you why Because he didn't have a real plan and he still doesn't what he had is talking points What he had is a concept of a plan and by the way, it was a mean and ugly concept You know what would actually help bring order to the border and actually help fix our immigration system the bipartisan deal That Kamala Harris supported even though it was written by one of the most conservative Republicans in Congress and Donald Trump Deliberately lobbied against it and told Republicans don't vote for it because he figured That if you passed it, he would not be able To engage in the same kind of fear mongering that he's been doing he will he will care more about winning an election Than he did to actually solve the problem Vote We do not need a president who's willing to make problems worse to make his politics better We need a president who actually cares about solving problems making your life better. That's what Kamala Harris will do And that's why you got a vote And To help her do it she needs a Senate full of public servants like Ruben Gallego Ruben Ruben Keep going while I take my sip of water Ruben You you heard Ruben speak a little bit about his life son of an immigrant single mom Growing up he and his sisters didn't have much He worked construction worked as a meat packer Anything to help his family Later he served in the Marines In Congress he's proven that he will stand up to corporate price gadget and work to lower cost for families Ruben's the kind of person we need in Washington This is the kind of person who's gonna help Kamala get stuff done Folks who share our values and we'll do whatever they can to move the country forward And him teaming up with Mark Kelly man, that's a that's a powerful one-two punch right there One of those values that Ruben Shares and that's talked a lot about in the campaign is freedom. So I want to talk a little bit about that I do not think we've ever had an election with candidates who Understand freedom so differently For Donald Trump and his cronies freedom means that the powerful can do whatever they please That's his definition of freedom of freedom. I want to fire workers for trying to organize a union. I should be free to do so You know that they're there they they want the freedom to throw out votes if they lose an election They were they want the they want to control what women can and can't do to their bodies It in other words for Trump freedom is getting away with stuff And it's like he said in the middle of the pandemic When he said I do not take any responsibility at all. I'm not sure any American president has ever uttered those words other than Donald Trump. I do not take any people were dying Hospitals overrun. I do not take any responsibility at all. That's his idea of freedom. I Do what I want and I'm not responsible for anything We have a broader idea of freedom We believe In the freedom to provide for our families if we're willing to work The freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water The freedom to send our kids to school without worrying if they'll come home safely We believe that true freedom Gives each of us the right to make decisions about our own lives How we worship who we marry what our family looks like? And we also believe that freedom requires us to recognize that other people Have the freedom to make different choices and it doesn't make them bad people. It doesn't make them evil people It doesn't make them enemies of the state I mean I I listen to some of the language that's being thrown around look Even on the most contentious issues I've always said there are good people of conscience on both sides of the abortion divide and I respect Anybody whose faith tells them that it's not something that they would do that they support But if we believe in freedom, then we should at least agree that such a deeply personal decision Should be made by the woman whose body is involved not by politicians And it's been fascinating to watch Donald Trump just try to tie himself into a pretzel on this issue because he sees that what his party has been doing is unpopular and so When he ran for president the first time he said he would support punishing women who got an abortion punishing women Then a couple weeks ago. He tells women he'll be their quote protector. I Will tell you how he protected you quote-unquote He hand-picked three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe versus Wade He bragged about it and now there are Trump abortion bans in 20 states Many of them with no exceptions for rape and incest And he's out there saying well, you know, everyone wanted it this way really Donald Trump may be confused, but let's be clear about what's at stake here If you send Ruben Gayle to the Senate He'll vote to restore the reproductive freedom the women had for nearly 50 years And if Congress passes that bill Kamala Harris will sign it in too long Because they understand freedom is about being able to make the right choice for ourselves and our families And here in Arizona, you don't even have to wait abortions actually on the ballot right here You have a chance to vote yes on prop 139 and put women not politicians back in control of their personal medical decisions It's an example of how at the end of the day But this election it's not just about policies It's not just about plans or concepts of a plan It's about values It's about who we are How we treat each other The example we want to set for our children and their children. It's about character Some of you know that when I was growing up, I didn't have a father in the house But I was lucky enough to have people around me a Stepfather for a time my grandparents teachers coaches and most of all my mom Who taught me the difference between right and wrong? Who who showed me what it meant to have integrity and to be honest and to be responsible and to work hard and to treat Other people the way I wanted them to treat me and and I I suspect most of you grew up the same way and And I you know, I wasn't perfect right off the bat And sometimes I didn't live up to those values and I made mistakes And I tried to learn from them and Then as I got older I continued to benefit from people who reinforced those values And obviously my wife Michelle was one of those people She's she's still trying to make me a little bit better But it but it wasn't just Michelle it was also friends and co-workers and neighbors and even political opponents people on the other side of the aisle and I Already mentioned it before being here in Tucson. I'm thinking about my friend John McKay Yeah now I Don't want to over romanticize our relationship and you know, John was conservative To put it mildly Ran against me in 2008 Talked about me on the campaign trail But you know what he understood that some values transcend party He believed in honest argument and Hearing the views of other people he didn't demonize His political opponents You remember at the time at the end of the campaign when a woman at one of his rallies said You know Obama that you know, you can't vote for that Arab You know, he's not even a citizen and she started going on a rant and he said ma'am ma'am. Hold on a second You know, I had a lot of disagreements with Senator Obama, but I served with him. He's a good man. He's an honorable man He's a patriotic American shut it down He knew that if we get in the habit If we get in the habit of bending the truth To suit political expediency or party orthodoxy our democracy can't work The man had character People like Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly have character Your governor has character your mayor has character That's what I think about these days. I Think about this a lot because it's so different from what we see right now out of the Republican nominee and increasingly the entire party Has just decided it's it's okay I mean one of the most disturbing things about this election and And Donald Trump's rise in politics is how we seem to have set aside The values that people like a John McCain stood for values. We were taught a Few weeks ago We had one of the deadliest hurricanes in American history And President Biden and Vice President Harris were down in North Carolina meeting with local officials and comforting families and meanwhile Donald Trump and his running mate Were making up stories circulating stories about how the Biden administration was withholding aid and and not giving it to Republican areas and giving it to undocumented immigrants just making stuff up And and even Republicans on the ground said it was a bald-faced lie And and there were real consequences to this the other day a man was arrested for threatening FEMA workers Emergency relief workers because he believed some of those lies that were being spread This isn't harmless yet people at their Some workers have been forced to relocate because they're worried about their safety people who are just trying to help and And and and you're trying to exploit that folks that they're most vulnerable It is shameful And and and because Donald Trump feels like making stuff up You've got hard work and public servants who cannot do their jobs and you've got desperate families being left to fend for themselves Some of them are not even applying for aid they're eligible for because they believed that well, there's no point because I'm not gonna get help So so my co my question is when did that become okay? Look no, no, just hold on a second. I Really want to focus on this No matter where you are on the issues How could you go along with that? I if if your co-workers acted like that They wouldn't be your co-workers for very long if you had a family member who acted like that just making stuff up hurtful stuff You might still love them But you tell them you got a problem and you certainly wouldn't put them in charge of anything And Yet when Donald Trump lies or cheats or bullies or shows utter disregard for our Constitution when he calls service members like John McCain losers Because they died in battle or were captured When he when he calls fellow citizens Berman or the enemy within People make excuses for it They think it's okay so long as their side wins And and and I have to say I've noticed this especially with some men who think Trump's behavior the bullying and putting people down and acting all you know pretend tough guy But somehow that's a sign of strength I Am here to tell you that is not what real strength is never has been real strength is about working hard and carrying a heavy load without complaining Real strength is about taking responsibility for your actions and telling the truth even when it's inconvenient real strength is about helping people who need it and Standing up for those who can't always stand up for themselves That's what we should want for our daughters and our sons That's what I want to see in the president of the United States of America And the good news is that you have a candidate You have candidates to vote for in this election Who demonstrate character? Who know what real strength looks like Who will set a good example and will do the right thing and leave this country better than they found it? And that is the choice in this election So if you are talking to friends and family and neighbors And it's hard to have political conversations right now Sometimes families are getting divided it's getting so intense Friendships are broken off because of it. It shouldn't be that way but Ruben and I were talking to a remarkable group of Men right before we came out and we were talking about this and somebody said man I'm just so tired of everybody being divided and mean and nasty and I said well, we don't we don't have to be that way we can we can make Arguments while still saying I love you and I'm gonna listen to you But you need to have those conversations though if somebody says well, I'm thinking about voting for Trump cuz I Remember the economy being pretty good remind them Why I was good If you say well, I'm mad about higher prices You say well What is exactly Donald Trump's plan for higher prices? Just ask him and if they don't you tell him he's got concepts of a plan And it don't make sense If if they're concerned about issues like immigration Ask him Well, what do you think he's gonna do? Because because we know where you did the first time didn't work you can have that conversation and if after you've gone through that and The folks who are unconvinced Say yeah, I don't know. I still like him Then you then I think you have to then say yeah, but what about character? What about values? Because that matters it's not just policies are on the ballot Don't vote for somebody who does not respect you Don't vote for somebody Who makes fun of people because they're not like them Don't pray on people who are weaker than you it's about values. It's about character So whether this election is making you feel excited or scared or hopeful or frustrated or anything in between Do not sit back and hope for the best Get off your coach and what? Put down your phone and do what? Vote for Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States Vote for Tim Wohl as the next vice president United States Vote for Ruben Gallego and this whole incredible Arizona Democratic ticket Tell your friends and family members and neighbors to do the same Because if enough of us Make our voices heard We will leave no doubt about the outcome of this election we will leave no doubt about who we are and what America stands for and Together we will keep building a country that is more fair and more just and more equal and more free That is our job. That's our responsibility Tucson let's go do it. Thank you. I love you. Bye. Bye You You You You You You You And let's send representatives lock into the United States Because we need them in DC we need them in DC I also want to thank all of the leaders of the Arab American community who are here As everyone know this community has deep and proud roots in the Detroit metro area And I am proud to have the support of Arab American leaders like Wayne County deputy We need a medic. Okay, we need a medic Let's figure out a way to part a little bit so that we can bring a medic in over here, please Okay Okay Okay, it looks like we need a medic over there too, is that what we're saying, okay Okay, we got a lot of folks in here it's a little warm let's just make sure we're looking out for each other, okay All right, it looks like we're good we're okay. All right. Okay. Thank you And always to our first responders, thank you for your work So as I was saying our Arab American community has deep and proud roots in the Detroit metro area And I am very proud to have the support of Arab American leaders like Wayne County deputy executive Assad Turfi And listen, I know this year has been very difficult given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and Given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon It is devastating and now Sinwar's death Can and must be a turning point Everyone must seize this opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza Bring the hostages home and end the suffering once and for all and I continue to believe Diplomacy is the answer to bringing lasting stability Across the Israel Lebanon border and as vice president and with your help as president I will do everything in my power to achieve these goals With security and dignity for all people in the region, so thank you all and Michigan listen, we got 18 days to get this done 18 short days and you all wouldn't be here spending your precious time here with all the other Obligations you've got if you did not know this is probably one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime And it's gonna be a tight race until the very end and We are the underdog and running as the underdog but make no mistake. We will win And we will win because we understand And we will win because we understand what is at stake This this election is about two very different visions for our nation One Donald Trump's that is focused on the past And the other and the other out That is focused on the future We are focused on a future where we bring down the cost of living invest in small businesses and entrepreneurs protect reproductive freedom That is in the future that we are fighting for but as you all know that's not what we're hearing from Donald Trump Instead it is the same old tired playbook He has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people. No plan Can I hear it again? No plan And he is only focused on himself and now check this out he is ducking debates and canceling interviews His own campaign team is saying it's because of exhaustion All right well Here's the thing if you are exhausted from the campaign trail It raises real questions about you are fit for the toughest job in the world And so folks for these reasons and more it is time to turn the page Because America is ready to chart a new way forward Ready for a new and optimistic generation Which is why Democrats Republicans independents are supporting our campaign In fact, you may have seen earlier this week over a hundred Republican leaders from across the country joined me on the campaign trail Including some who served under Donald Trump's administration because you know, they know him best they understand what's at stake and I believe Americans want a president and deserve a president who works for all the American people And that has been as you all know the story of my entire career I've only in my career had one client the people As a young courtroom prosecutor I protected women and children as Attorney General of California I fought for students and veterans who are being scammed by those for-profit colleges As vice president, I have stood up for workers and seniors and as president I will fight for all the American people always Always And together Us and you we will together like I want you to shout your own name for a minute Let's do that really quickly shout your own name for a minute That's what I'm talking about because it's about you it's about your family It's about you That's what I'm talking about That's what I'm talking about Because together we will build a brighter future for our nation together together A future where we build what I call an opportunity economy so that every American has an opportunity to own a home Buy a car build wealth start a business right Under my plan we will deal with things like bringing down the cost of housing we will help entrepreneurs Start and grow a small business. Do we have any small business owners here? Yeah Our small businesses are the backbone of america's economy My plan will expand medicare to cover home health care for seniors And look as with so many of the issues that are priority issues for me including small businesses the issue of home health care Look i'm going to just go off script for a moment. So when my mother was When my mother was sick, I took care of her And for anyone here who has or is taking care of an older relative You know what it is It's about trying to cook something that they feel like eating It's about trying to put some clothes on them that won't irritate their skin Right, it's about from time to time trying to figure out what you can say that will bring a smile to their face or make them laugh It's about dignity It's about dignity And here's the here's the deal When you look at everyone who is doing that and then you look at the what we call the sandwich generation Which are people who are raising your young children and taking care of your parents It's a lot And either you have enough money to afford to have somebody come in and help you which most people don't Or you might have to give up your job, which means you're cutting off a source of income for your household Or you have to spend down your savings to qualify for medicaid That's just not right So my plan is to say that we are going to fix it so that medicare Covers the cost of home health care work for seniors Because it's about dignity it's about dignity so more seniors can live at home with dignity Our plan will lower costs on everything from health care to groceries I'm going to take on corporate price gouging like i've done before i'm going to do it again My plan will also give middle class tax cuts to 100 million americans including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life because here is where i'm coming from The vast majority of our young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well But not always the resources And so looking at expanding the child tax credit again, it's about dignity It's about recognizing That folks just need a little help to buy a car seat or a crib or the essential needs for your child During such a critical stage Development And by the way, we all benefit from that everybody benefits from that So these are just some examples of our plan and all of that to say look i will always I will always Stand up and say I will always stand and fight for the middle class and working families of america I come from the middle class and I will never forget where I come from My plan also invests in american manufacturing and innovation And I will make sure america not china wins the competition for the 21st century Michigan knows Better than most what that means about investing in american industry Under my plan. We will invest in the industries that built america like steel iron and the great american auto industry And contrary to what my opponent is suggesting I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive But here's what I will do I will invest in communities like oakland county and detroit We will retool existing factories and hire locally and work with unions to create good paying jobs Including by the way jobs that do not require a college degree because this is how I feel look This is how I feel about that We all know a college degree is not the only measure Of the skills and experience of a qualified worker So part of my plan is to do an assessment of all the federal jobs, which will be under our jurisdiction to figure out which of them should be rethought of in terms of whether or not it actually requires a college degree and the next step on that is going to be to Challenge the private sector to do the same I Will also protect the pensions of union members and retirees Including yesterday when I announced the protection of the full earned pension benefits of more than 22 500 retirees under the detroit carpenters pension fund Because back to the point about dignity I understand the dignity of work and I understand the importance of having dignity in your retirement Now donald trump has a different approach I don't need to tell you he's full of big promises but always fails to deliver always fails to deliver so Remember he said he was the only one. You know how he talks the only one Who could bring back america's manufacturing jobs remember when he said that And then america lost almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president Including tens of thousands of jobs right here in michigan And those losses started before the pandemic, okay Making donald trump one of the biggest losers Of manufacturing jobs in american history And his and his track record for the auto industry was also a disaster He promised workers in warren You remember he promised workers in warren that the auto industry would and i'm going to quote not lose one plant during his presidency then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president Including general motors in warren and stellantis in detroit remember that Thousands thousands of michigan auto workers lost their jobs And donald trump's running mate, you know because the the position was vacant and he had to fill it, right? You know for the young people here You know when you go for an interview and you sit down at the interview and you ask the person who's interviewing Why is the job vacant? So donald trump's current running mate Recently suggested that if they win they would threaten the grand river assembly plant in lansing The same plant that our administration protected earlier this year saving 650 union jobs And remember donald trump encouraged automakers to move their plants out of michigan So they could pay their workers less And when the uaw went on strike when the uaw went on strike to demand the higher wages that you deserved Donald trump went to a non-union shop Remember And he attacked the uaw And he said striking he said striking and collective bargaining don't and i'm gonna quote Don't make a damn bit of difference. That's what he said About striking and collective bargaining well michigan, you know better we know better strong unions Mean higher wages better health care and greater dignity For union members and everyone else Because you don't have to be a member of a union to thank unions For your five-day work week and your vacation time and your sick leave thank a union Which is why when i am president with your help i will sign the pro act into law and make it easier for workers to join a union And negotiate for better pay and working conditions And now donald trump is making the same empty promises to the people of michigan that he did before Hoping you will forget How he let you down the last time But we're not falling for the okey-doke No And we won't be fooled Just for example google project 2025 Which i still by the way find it fascinating to think that they actually put that in writing I mean they put it in writing they published it they bound it And gave it out Right and here's the thing To read it is to know it is a detailed and dangerous blueprint For what he will do if he is elected president Donald trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts cut social security and medicare Get rid of the 35 cap on insulin for seniors that you all helped us get Make it easier. He will read it make it He will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay Read it make it he will make it easier for companies to deny overtime pay to workers And he intends to impose what I call a trump sales tax Which is at least 20 percent if not more of a tax on everyday basic necessities Which economists have estimated will cost the american family? An additional four thousand dollars a year And if that weren't enough on top of this and all of this he plans to end the affordable care act And he has no plan to replace it He has because he has quote concepts of a plan So you all have heard me say, you know, I think I think donald trump is an unserious man And The consequences if he were to ever get in back into the white house are are absolutely dangerously serious Because think about it he's going to threaten that health insurance coverage of 45 Okay So here's the thing Here's the thing about that Here's the thing about that the courts are going to take care of that We're gonna take care of november We're gonna take care of november. How about that? Right? We'll take care of november But again concepts of a plan so think about it in terms of the serious nature of this He's basically threatening the health insurance coverage of 45 million americans Based on a concept and taking us back to when you remember Insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was? And that's why we are not going back We are not going back No, we are not going back we will move forward Because ours is a fight for the future Ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own Body and not have her government tell her what to do And we are we remember how we got here right Donald trump hand selected three members of the united states supreme court With the intention that they would undo the protections of rovi weight and they did as he intended and now check this out In america one in three women live in a state with a trump abortion ban Many with no exception even for rape and incest which which means you're telling someone who is a survivor Of a violation to their body that they have no right To make a decision about what happens to their body next That is immoral immoral And let us agree One does not have to abandon their faith Or deeply held beliefs to agree. The government should not be telling her what to do with her body Not the government Not the government No, if she chooses she will talk with her priest her pastor her rabbi her imam But not the government and some folks up in a state house telling her what's in her own best interest And so here's my pledge to you when congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide As president of the united states, I will proudly sign it into law And across our nation listen i'm traveling the country and i'll tell you across our nation We are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-won freedoms and rights Including the freedom to vote. Let me tell you Adapt in in places like georgia where i'm spending some time You know, they put a lot of money in the country And they're going to be able to get a bill that's going to be a bill that's going to be a bill In places like georgia where i'm spending some time, you know, they passed a law That makes it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote Yeah, I mean the hypocrisy abounds what happened to love thy neighbor Attacks on the freedom to join a union Attacks on the freedom to be safe from gun violence mia talked about that Attacks on the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride So I say all that to say what you know, which is again why you are spending your precious time here There is so much on the line in this election And this is not 2016 or 2020 The stakes are even higher because remember a few months ago The supreme court of the united states basically told the former president that he is effectively immune From doing whatever he does in office And just imagine donald trump with no guardrails just imagine He who has vowed if reelected to be a dictator on day one He who calls americans who disagree with him the enemy from within you know where that language comes from And says that he would use the military the american military to go after the american people He who has called for the quote termination of the constitution of the united states of america And And let us be very clear Someone who suggests we should terminate the constitution of the united states of america Should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the united states of america Never again Never again Never again So we are not going back and so this is how we're gonna make sure we don't go back Okay, so here let's get to the business then So michigan, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we know what is at stake We are here together most importantly also because we love our country We love our country And I do believe it is one of the highest expressions and forms of love of our country and patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight And to fight to realize the promise of america so Election days in 18 days Okay And here in michigan early voting starts on saturday october 26 one week from tomorrow If you live in wayne county, you can vote in person Even sooner early voting in detroit starts tomorrow So now is the time to make your plan to vote And if you have received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait Fill it out tonight and return it because Folks the election is here Thank you And we need to as you know best how to do we need to energize We need to organize We need to mobilize Knowing knowing our vote is our voice And your voice is your power So Michigan today I ask you are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom Do we believe in opportunity Do we believe in the promise of america And are we ready to fight for it And when we fight we win god bless you god bless america Oh Do
