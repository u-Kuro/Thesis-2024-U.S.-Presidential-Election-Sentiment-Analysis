Join the movement. Alright, so Arizona 2024. Everyone's kind of holding their breath on this one, right? Yeah, it feels that way. Because Arizona is, well, it's a wild card. Big time. Huge! And you know, anyone who needs a reminder, just think back to 2020. Arizona went blue. Those 11 electoral votes went right to Biden. Right, which are totally up for grabs now. Totally. With Trump and Harris in the ring, those 11 votes are anyone's game. It's a tightrope walk for both campaigns, that's for sure. No kidding. We've got polls here, and they are all over the place. Let's see. Real clear politics. They've got Trump up by one point. Which, let's be real, that's basically a tie at this stage. Basically, yeah. And then 538, they give him a little bit more of an edge, a two-point lead. But here's where it gets interesting. The Wall Street Journal. They actually have Harris ahead by two points as well. So like, what do we even do with all that? Honestly, it's enough to make your head spin, right? And then you've got the NYTC on a poll, that one showing Trump with a five-point lead. Right. And Emerson's giving him two points. It's close, no doubt about it. Totally. But you know what I find really interesting? That Wall Street Journal poll, the one we just mentioned with Harris ahead, even being slightly ahead of where Biden was at the same point back in 2020, that's not nothing. That's saying something. Okay, so we're maybe seeing a little bit of a swing there. Maybe. But polls, they're just numbers, right? I want to know what's going on with actual Arizona voters. What are they worried about? The million dollar question, right? We have to look beyond just the numbers and get into the core of what matters to people in Arizona. And I'll tell you, from everything I'm seeing, the economy is a big one, a really big one. The cost of living is out of control, inflation. It's hitting everyone hard. Yeah, and this Daily Signal article really highlights that. They talk about this single mom in Phoenix. She's spending almost $200 more on groceries every week now compared to last year. Wow. Yeah, it's a lot. That's got to be rough for families who are just trying to get by. Absolutely. And I think that economic anxiety feeds into anxieties about government spending. Is that what's driving inflation? Voters want answers. They want solutions. They want to be able to put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. It's basic. And if we're talking about solutions, we got to talk about what the candidates are actually doing. Yeah. Right? I mean, how are Trump and Harris trying to connect with these Arizona voters, especially the ones who are really feeling that economic pinch? Right. And they're definitely going about it in different ways. I mean, take Trump. He went on that Dave Ramsey show. Oh, yeah, the finance guy. Exactly. The personal finance guru. So smart move, right? He's speaking directly to those anxieties about the economy. And he's reaching an audience that really cares about things like budgeting and saving. Right. And yeah, inflation. Totally going right to the source. But Harris, she did something completely different, didn't she? Yeah, totally different vibe. She went on that Call Her Daddy podcast. Oh. Yeah. Definitely raised a few eyebrows with that one. I mean, some people were like, is that really the right place for a presidential candidate? But you got to admit that podcast has a huge audience, especially with younger voters. Oh, yeah, for sure. Different generation, different approach. Totally. And that's what they have to do because honestly, Arizona voters, they're not just thinking about the national stuff. They have their own unique challenges to deal with. Immigration, that's a big one. Always a hot topic, right? Always. But in Arizona, it's different. With that massive border they share with Mexico, it's not just talk, it's real life. Especially with that ballot measure coming up, one about immigration and border enforcement, that's got to be on everyone's minds right now. Totally. And you can see it in the way the candidates are handling it. Trump is sticking to his guns, going hard on that whole border security message. But Harris, she's trying to strike a different tone. More compassion, talking about immigration reform and all that, really shows you how divided people are on this. Yeah, totally different approaches. And then there's the whole water crisis you're talking about before. That's a big one too. I mean, Arizona is running out of water. This isn't just politics anymore. This is serious stuff. It's huge. Water is essential and it's becoming scarcer and scarcer, especially out West. Voters, they want to know how are these candidates going to deal with this? It's a big deal. And again, we're seeing different strategies. Trump, he hasn't really focused on water that much. It's more about the economy for him. Harris though, she's been talking about it. The need for solutions for the long term, talking about investing in water infrastructure and all that. So yeah, definitely a key issue for Arizona's future. And I think voters are paying attention. It's kind of wild how something like water, you'd think everyone would be on the same page about that. But I guess that just goes to show you how divided things are. And you know what else feeds into that? This whole voter integrity thing. Especially here in Arizona, that's been a big point of contention. Absolutely. There's a real lack of trust in the system. And we've seen some things happen that have made it worse. Like that court case about those 42,000 voters, that whole citizenship check thing. That really brought the issue to the forefront. Right. What was the deal with that again? So there was this legal challenge, right? Arguing that Arizona should be verifying the citizenship of those voters. And it went back and forth, but the court decided that counties, they don't have to do those checks so close to the election, which calmed things down a little because people were worried about voters getting disenfranchised. But the fact that it went to court at all, it just shows you how much distrust there is. Yeah, for sure. And then you've got that whole debate over voter ID laws, which never seems to go away. Right. Always a hot topic. And the funny thing is, even with all the controversy around voter ID laws, they're actually pretty popular. I mean, most Americans, like 70 to 80% across party lines, they think you should have to show ID to vote. It's like common sense to them. Sure. So it's one of those issues where the public and the politicians, not exactly on the same page. Everyone wants to make sure things are fair and secure, but how to get there? That's the tricky part. But hey, it's not all doom and gloom, right? I mean, we did come across some positive stories too, about organizations working to get more people involved in the process, especially in communities that have historically been left out. Absolutely. And that's crucial, that kind of work. Places like R America, they're doing amazing work, really grassroots stuff, engaging with communities face to face, trying to rebuild some of that trust that's been lost. So it's all about meeting people where they are. Exactly. And R America, what they're doing is really interesting. They're zeroing in on the issues that really hit home for these communities, like crime rates, the economy, education, the stuff that keeps people up at night. Real life stuff. Exactly. By focusing on that, they're building connections and hopefully getting people to believe in the system again. It's like they're saying, look, we see you, we hear your concerns and your vote. It matters. It's a powerful message. Super powerful, especially right now when everything feels so, I don't know. Divided. Yeah, divided and so out of touch with what regular people are dealing with makes you wonder, where do we go from here? Right. After everything we've talked about, it's easy to feel kind of, I don't know, defeated. Is there any hope for us to find common ground or are we just stuck in this loop of arguing? It's a question I keep coming back to. I get it. It's easy to be pessimistic looking at everything that's going on, but I really do think there are these little sparks of hope. Oh, okay. Yeah. Our sources, they actually back that up. Did you know that even with everything, all the division, most Americans, they still believe in the American dream across generations. They still believe in a better future. See, now that gives me hope. Knowing that underneath it all, we still want the same things. But how do we get there? How do we take that hope, that shared dream, and make it a reality, especially in this crazy political climate? That's the million dollar question, right? I think it starts with tuning out the noise, all the back and forth, all the argument. We got to focus on the things we actually agree on, the things that affect all of us. Okay, like what? Like the economy, healthcare, education, even something as basic as the water crisis here in Arizona. Those are issues that go way beyond just Democrat or Republican. They affect everybody. And if the campaigns, if they can tap into that, if they can offer real solutions instead of just the same old talking points. Then we can actually get somewhere. Exactly. It's about reminding people that, hey, we're all in this together, right? Yeah. We might have different ways of getting there, but ultimately we all want the same thing. We want a better future. Couldn't have said it better myself. So to anyone listening out there, if you're feeling overwhelmed by all the political stuff, just remember what happens in Arizona. It matters. It really matters. Keep your eyes open, pay attention. Don't just look at the polls. Look at what the candidates are actually doing. Are they listening to what people are worried about? Are they offering solutions or just more of the same old, same old? Because that's what matters in the end. You got it. So Arizona, we're watching you and to everyone listening, thanks for taking this deep dive with us. We'll be back next time with another episode, another topic, more insights, and hopefully even more reasons to be optimistic about the future. Until then, stay curious, stay engaged, and don't be afraid to ask the tough questions.
