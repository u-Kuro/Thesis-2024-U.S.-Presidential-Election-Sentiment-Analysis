 Developing right now, we're learning more about plans for Vice President Kamala Harris' trip to Tonopah next week. She's expected to visit Thursday. The Vice President will highlight the Biden administration's clean energy investments. They have a goal to reach net zero economy by 2050. Federal data ranks Arizona fifth in the country for solar powered electricity generation. About 16 percent of our energy is solar. Almost the rest comes from hydroelectric power and wind energy. This is the first time the Vice President will visit Arizona since 2021 when she toured Lake Mead, now the face of shrinking water supply concerns for the Southwest.
