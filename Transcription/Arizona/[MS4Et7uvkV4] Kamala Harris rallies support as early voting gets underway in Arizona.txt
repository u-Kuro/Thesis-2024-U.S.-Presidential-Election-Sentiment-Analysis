 Yes, very eager crowd at this point. Jared, when we spoke to you guys about an hour ago at four o'clock, people had just kind of started finding their way in. There was a bit of a crowd, but the energy has totally shifted to this point. The lights are down. People were given bracelets that are lighting up, and the area really behind us is pretty packed at this point. And we're still not expecting the VP to show up for the next hour or two at this point. So people were lining up again on another hot day in the hundreds here in early October. Let's show you the line of people out there earlier today hoping to get the chance to be up close and see the VP speak here tonight and Chandler. And Harris supporters here we talked to say they know Arizona is really an important state. She needs to win to capture the White House. We spoke to one of her supporters who has already seen the VP at one of her earlier stops in our state and hopes more people are able to hear her message tonight. I believe in all of her policies. I'd like to hear a little bit more specifics, but to rile up the crowd and try and figure out how to get some of those independent voters that I don't understand why they're still undecided. Yes, as I was saying earlier, the place is really starting to be packed. They've had some chance going at some points in support of Harris. We even heard chants saying Donald Trump must go, which you could expect from the other side in this two-person race for the presidency. So we are expecting her again in that six o'clock hour, six to seven. As soon as she comes out, we'll be sure to let you know and we'll have that for you here on Arizona's Family. But for now, I'll send it back to you guys in the studio. We'll see you back here in about an hour at six o'clock.
