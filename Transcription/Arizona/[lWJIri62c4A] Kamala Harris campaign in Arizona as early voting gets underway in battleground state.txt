 Kamala Harris has been campaigning in Arizona, which could be a deciding swing state in the US election. The Democratic presidential candidate attempted to tackle a political vulnerability at the border states. I know we are going to win this election and it is not going to be easy. Vice President Kamala Harris making a campaign stop in the crucial battleground state of Arizona today. So when we think about what is at stake in this election, whoa, it is packed with some stuff. Last night she participated in a Univision town hall in Nevada, where she raised eyebrows with this comment. So I will put my record up against anyone in terms of the work I have always done and will always do to ensure we have a secure border. Kamala Harris is out west, her surrogates are teeing off on Trump. Those guys, all they know about manufacturing is manufacturing bull. Donald Trump is a 78 year old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago. Tim Walz appeared on ABC this morning, explaining why he was out of step with his running mate on wanting to eliminate the electoral college. The point I'm trying to make is that there are folks that feel every vote must count in every state. So that's something that the U.N. President disagree on. She's been very clear on this and the campaign in my position is the campaign's position. Meanwhile, former President Obama is worried about what he sees as a lack of support for Kamala Harris from black men, even suggesting sexism may be at play. Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president. That's not exciting. Former President Trump is going to be here in Arizona on Sunday. He'll be holding his own campaign rally on Sunday. Both campaigns have different messaging on the border. Donald Trump promising mass deportations. Kamala Harris promising protections for Dreamers.
