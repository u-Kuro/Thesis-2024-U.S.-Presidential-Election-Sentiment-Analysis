 You decide a new poll out this morning is showing Donald Trump still has the edge with voters in Arizona But with a large share of voters still undecided is shaping up to be a very tight race Noble predictive insights posting the poll this morning and you see the number 47% for Trump 44% for Kamala Harris still nearly 10% though 9% to be precise Said they hadn't made up their mind margin of error 3 plus or minus 3 While Trump had the lead in the poll there are signs Arizona voters Definitely prefer Harris as the Democrats candidate over Joe Biden. She now has a 5-point lead in independence in May Trump had a 10-point lead among independence over Biden Also among Hispanics and Latinos Harris has a 12-point lead Biden had only a 2-point edge young voters also giving Harris the edge The poll has plenty of good news though for Trump as well when it comes to immigration he has a 14-point lead on who would best handle it between him and Kamala Harris and when it comes to inflation Arizona voters feel he would do a better job of handling it than Harris who has already been in office for the last three plus Years voters also have more faith in Trump on how he'll handle taxes and gun rights Harris has the edge on abortion So while we've seen Harris get a big bump in a lot of the national polls since Biden was pressured to drop out He's really not seeing much of that in Arizona this very same groups poll in May showed Trump With a three-point lead that was 44 41 this brand new poll still shows Trump with a three-point lead guys you
