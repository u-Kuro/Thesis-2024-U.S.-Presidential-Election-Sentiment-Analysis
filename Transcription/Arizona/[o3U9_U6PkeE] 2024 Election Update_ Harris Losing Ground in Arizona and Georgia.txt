 Hello and welcome back to 3plus1 Media where we talk about people politics and pop culture and today in politics we are doing our biweekly Harris vs Trump check in. Polls are popping almost daily and the media is quick to pick the poll that fits their narrative and spin the data in the way that serves their desired outcomes. And when I say desired outcomes I am uncertain that a particular candidate is what matters as of today. I believe it is significantly more about ensuring that people stay in a state of anxiety ridden engagement. That's what I believe. So when I look at the data I am looking at multiple things not just one poll but multiple polls and I am focusing on the averages of these top tier highly rated polls. And while I mention the polls highlighting popular vote I am here to focus a lot more on swing states and the polls from the swing states because that is what will determine who will be the 47th president of the United States of America and mainstream media always gives you the average of the national vote. With that being said let's go right into that popular vote and a rolling unweighted national average of recently highly rated polls of the last 28 days gives us this data. Vice President Kamala Harris leads by 2.8 points in the national polling average. Kamala Harris is up 49.1 to 46.3 for former president Donald Trump. The thing is um duh. Who needs to poll for that. No one doubts that Vice President Harris will win the popular vote or that President Joseph Robinette Biden would have won the popular vote as well. What Donald Trump wants to do to America is only popular in Russia. I really can't wait to see Project 2025 if a minute said no American ever. 70% of us American voters citizens of this country are opposed to his Project 2025 agenda but popular vote unfortunately does not determine the president of the United States the Electoral College does and according to real clear politics this is where we stand today. When I do I think it's fairly accurate Iowa in my opinion should be light red if New Hampshire is going to be made light blue but otherwise this is a pretty good snapshot of where we are today and where we have to go in the 40 something days ahead. Now of course I'm locked in on Georgia where the majority of top rated polls this week give Trump a slight advantage. I think I think he is up in Georgia. We have a lot of work to do we're doing it we're working but there's a lot of work left. I'm also locked in on North Carolina where basically Trump and Harris are tied. That to me is a very interesting development this week since my last biweekly polls and according to my favorite data guy Simon Rosenberg there is no viable path for Trump to win the White House without the state of North Carolina. Harris is tied or leads in every recent independent non GOP sponsored poll in that state and now with what's happening with city lieutenant governor Mark Robinson who is literally running for governor is an absolute enormous development in this election that is a very very bad turn for Donald Trump and what he what he needs to win this election. Now I just want to bookmark right here where we are with this data set and this is a recent CBS poll that came out on September the 20th and this is where we stand. In Arizona Harris is at 50% Trump is at 49% in Georgia 49% to Trump's 50% in Nevada Harris is at 51% to Trump's 48% and in North Carolina according to this poll Harris is up by 1 over Trump 49 49% to 48% when you move over to the next series of states. The desperately needed for Democrats blue wall Michigan has Harris up by 250% to Trump's 48%. Pennsylvania is a virtual tie according to this CBS poll 49% Harris 49% Trump and Wisconsin is leaning Harris at 50% to Trump's 48%. Now when you dig a little bit deeper and we go into a summary of the top polls this is what they this is where they stand this week the third week moving to the fourth week of September for 538 they give Vice President Harris a 60 to 39% chance of winning race to the White House my other favorite poll that I continuously look at to get the average of polls identifies Harris at a 60 to 40% chance of victory the economist gives Harris 57% of Trump's 43% at a chance of victory whereas the the JH cursing poll gives Harris a 56 to Trump's 43% chance of winning decision desk headquarters gives Harris a 55 to Trump's 45% chance of winning while CNN and while the C analysis poll identifies Harris at 54% to Trump's 45% poly market the betting poll site that Trump gives great credibility to although no one else really does has Harris at a 51% chance of winning to Trump's 48% and then the my least favorite poll and being these days the Nate Silver the Nate Silver 538 poll the silver bullet 10 or whatever that foolishness is that's being sponsored by Peter Thiel gives Harris a 51% to Trump's 49% these are indeed the polls that are considered some of the top or highly rated polls that are out there so that's where we stand in regards to the polls and the polling and that's one thing I use to delineate how I want to do my own personal map and we're going to give you my personal prediction shortly but before we go on to my personal predictions there's some qualitative metrics that should also be looked at when we talk about who's going to win any given election one thing that indicates candidacy strength is spending and when you look at ad spin as determined and reported by ad impact Harris is significantly outspending Trump in Sweden states significantly and what's interesting is that Trump has focused his efforts on two states he is counting on flipping Georgia back red and winning Pennsylvania that is his one path to the White House if he can hold on to North Carolina yet in Pennsylvania Trump is spending seventy seven point nine million to Kamala Harris is 195.8 million baby that's double the span that is double the span and favor of VP Harris voter enthusiasm seems to be the new quali qualitative metric that everyone wants to tout Trump started doing this in the 2020 election and it's carried over now look while polls can survey enthusiasm other factors like crowd size at rallies and voter registration data are really strong indicators and we're going to start first with this voter registration piece and then look at these these rallies and we're going to take a look at my home state battleground Georgia over 120,000 new voters have registered in Georgia since August the majority of them are younger voters and that's no surprise 50% of them are under 30 among registered voters and most of them are indeed voters of color counties with the largest percent of increase are like counties like Winnet County and majority black Richmond which has a city of Augusta there but I want to also give you some questions how many of these are people who had to read register because they got purged from the rolls how many of them are actually going to vote for a Democratic candidate Muscogee Richmond Chatham having an increase is indeed great for Harris but Lanier Long and Houston counties having an increase is great for Trump so don't forget that like keep that in mind as you look at these things now according to a Fox News Post made by Brooke Singman and Brooke stated in her article in key battleground states where voters registered by party and where the margins in 2020 were greater thin Republicans have cut into Democrats voter registration advantage in some cases by hundreds of thousands of registered voters during the 2020 election cycle in Pennsylvania where there were approximately six hundred eighty five thousand more registered Democrats as opposed to Republicans but going into election at 2024 that gap has been cut down significantly with approximately 343,000 more Democratic voters than Republicans this is according to the Trump campaign so take it with a with whatever you take that data with and they said they compiled this with from the data given to them by the Secretary of State's offices in Pennsylvania and then also they had data from Nevada North Carolina and also Arizona and mentioning Nevada there were 87,000 more Democratic voters in 2020 when compared to Republicans but going into election day 2024 there are only 19,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans North Carolina shows a similar shrinking gap for 2024 with just 126,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans down for 391,000 Democrats last cycle and in Arizona by the end of July there were 259,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats doubling the GOP advantage since 2020 now is this true again child it's Fox News taking reports given to them about the Trump campaign seems pretty factual however based on what I have seen from other sources of the items to research this for the purpose of making this specific video I say that to say I think that Democrats still have the voter registration and advantage but they're saying the advantage lies with Democrats because Republicans are seen as more reliable voters they turn out at higher numbers during election years when compared to their Democratic polls it's just a sad fact of life look at crowd size which is something that Donald Trump touted repeatedly in 2016 and 2020 I cannot help but to look at this image of a rally held in Madison Wisconsin for Vice President Kamala Harris and this image of a rally held for Donald Trump in Pennsylvania the crowd sizes are exceptionally different and the decrease in participants for Trump to me is dark to say that voter enthusiasm currently is with Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party oh that is where we are today my personal predictive map currently with all of that being said looks like this if we voted today I still give the advantage to Vice President Harris with a change from the last map two weeks ago to Arizona flipping it sadly back to rare for Trump based upon the data that I'm seeing now now I'm gonna with that being said I am going to show you now my dream map which I still think is possible but unlikely now this is my dream map and this is what I think will actually happen by November if we work hard and stay the course Georgia and North Carolina are absolutely possible and in play and likely to go for Harris if we put in the work with that being said I want you to be well be blessed and whatever you do keep pushing I'll see you soon
