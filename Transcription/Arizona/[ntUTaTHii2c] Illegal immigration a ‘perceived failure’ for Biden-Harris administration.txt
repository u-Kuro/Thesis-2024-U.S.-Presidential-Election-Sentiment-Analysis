 And it's good to have you company on this Wednesday morning folks. Thank you so much for joining us We are broadcasting live from Nogales in southern Arizona this morning on the US-Mexico border That is Mexico over there. This is the United States and there is a big wall obviously But runs through the two nations. This is the front line in America's fight against illegal immigration Illegal immigration being a central plank of Donald Trump's election campaign and a perceived failure of the Biden-Harris administration Which Donald Trump was very eager to remind viewers about a little early this morning when making his final pitch to voters Her borders are the worst in the history of the world. There's never been a border in the world like this I'm announcing that for the first time under my administration. We will be seizing the assets of the criminal gangs and drug cartels And we will use those assets to create a Compensation fund to provide restitution for the victims of migrant crime So that was a big policy announcement from Donald Trump this morning getting in ahead of a big moment in Kamala Harris's campaign in the next few hours where she will be making her final pitch to voters in a closing statement even though there is still another seven days to run and She'll be doing it from the precise spot from that. We saw these now infamous comments from Donald Trump almost four years ago We will never give up we will never concede it doesn't happen you don't concede Because you'll never take back our country with weakness you have to show strength So that's from the ellipse in Washington DC so perhaps Kamala Harris Symbolic there stirring the pot as I mentioned in those closing remarks Her team says she'll be delivering a more hopeful statement today Rather than that dark rhetoric that she says Donald Trump has been using over the past few days weeks and months One week before polls close Vice President Kamala Harris could be delivering one of the most Important speeches of her campaign the former prosecutor plans to deliver her closing arguments at the same site as former President Donald Trump's January 6th speech that preceded chaotic scenes at the Capitol This isn't even about Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump It's about the American people and I think the backdrop of the White House Being at the ellipse today the last time a lot of the American people saw that was on January 6th The Trump Vance campaign is feeling positive about its momentum even with polls showing razor-thin margins We've had the greatest rallies in the history of the world not just this country has never been I mean we filled up Madison Square Garden last night Trump's rally today is in Allentown, Pennsylvania Which has a majority Hispanic population it comes as the campaign is still playing defense After a comedian at their New York City rally made a joke about Puerto Rico being a floating island of garbage Some Democrats have also tried drawing parallels to Adolf Hitler something Trump and his allies are pushing back on hard This is the kind of outrageous rhetoric that has resulted in two Assassination attempts in the last three months new Fox power rankings still show six of the seven battleground states as toss-ups So just a reminder Kamala Harris is closing remarks It's strange to say closing remarks even though there's another week of campaigning still to go, but it's a big speech It'll be at the ellipse in Washington DC it will be live and it will be in full right here on Sky News Just under four hours from now. It'll be a big event though because there is an expectation that some 40,000 people will be there Also today relating to Kamala Harris a bit of an oopsie moment She was caught on a hot hot mic from a couple of days ago complaining about her inability to woo male voters Oh Kenny the old hot mic so as I mentioned we are broadcasting live from Nogales in southern Arizona this morning. This is part of the wall now There's some 3,000 kilometers of border between the United States and Mexico This is part of it and a local sheriff gave us a little tour of it a little bit earlier today Kenny and we'll be playing those comments for you and our story about the wall as well as some statistics that shows Illegal immigration might actually be trending down. We'll be back soon. Okay. It's good to see you Pete We'll talk to you soon. And there's exactly seven days to go until the US elect
