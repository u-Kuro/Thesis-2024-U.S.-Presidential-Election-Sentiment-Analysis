 I guess I feel like bad most of the time if you see like Trump stuff posted everywhere. These are the most important elections that I found that I've ever voted in. Controversial. It's been unusual. I haven't seen something like this for a long time. It's conservative values versus woke liberal values and where your stance on that is politically and religiously. It's polarized, man. It's very polarized and there is a lot of conflict and a lot of different aspects of this country that it's very hard to place where it's gonna go. I don't know. I taught my kids, four of them, not to cheat, lie or steal. If I told you who I'm voting for then... I'm a woman. I think if you are supporting women's rights then there's only one answer.
