 Thanks. Turning now to the presidential race campaign trail heating up in Arizona. Both sides hoping to sway voters and drive turnout. ABC 15 political reporter Ben Brown in Tucson tonight where a former president made a stop this afternoon. Arizona is back in the political spotlight. This time, former President Barack Obama in Tucson campaigning on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris. Thousands of people packed to stadium in Tucson as former President Barack Obama held a rally encouraging people to get out and vote early. He talked about Vice President Kamala Harris's policy agenda while attacking former President Donald Trump on his record when he was in the White House. I understand why people are looking to shake things up. I get why sometimes folks are frustrated with politics. I'm sometimes frustrated with politics. So so so I get it. What I cannot understand is why anyone would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you. That I don't understand. Voters we talked to were excited to hear Obama speak. They said they see Harris as a candidate who can unify the country and bring change. The number one issue in my world is democracy. We need somebody that's going to take care of this country and what we've seen especially on January 6th that was a disgrace to this country and that should have never ever happened. This country used to be about respect and it used to be we could have political discourse and now it's just name calling and hate and we don't want to do that. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs along with Senator Mark Kelly and Democratic Senate candidate Ruben Gallego also spoke at the rally on the Republican side JD Vance will campaign next week in Arizona. For the ABC 15 political team I'm Ben Brown.
