 Our team coverage continues now. Manuelita Beck with the ABC 15 political team listening tonight to groups working with Black and Latino voters. Groups here in Arizona that work with communities of color insisting Democrats need Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket. What we're seeing now is folks who are excited that, you know, the Democratic Party and leaders are beginning to coalesce around a nominee and Vice President Harris. Members of Latino group Lucha even meeting Sunday unanimously endorse Harris. It is time to be able to deliver the strongest candidate in this November election. Both Lucha and our voice are Vote Arizona calling on Democrats to settle on a nominee soon. My hope and I think the hope of a lot of leaders is that when the convention happens in Chicago that it's crystal clear that Kamala Harris is the nominee. They're telling me Harris could energize younger voters who might otherwise have stayed home in November. It changes the conversation for them because it's sort of this is a newer generation. Patino noting Harris's personal story is inspiring to younger voters of color. They may not agree with all her policies and the things that she has done specifically around her prosecution record, but it's just that she's a woman of color and she has made it that far. But Latino and black voters are also focused on the issues, housing costs, immigration and reproductive health. Our communities are asking about real issues while they are seeing political theater play out on the national stage. Most of all black and Latino groups telling me there's now hope for November. One of the things that I'm hearing from communities of color is that this is an election that we can't afford to lose. For ABC 15's political team, I'm Manually Tebec.
