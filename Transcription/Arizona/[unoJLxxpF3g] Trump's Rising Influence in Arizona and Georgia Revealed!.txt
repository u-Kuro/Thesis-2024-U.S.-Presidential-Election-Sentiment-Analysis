 So you think Trump probably does have an advantage in Arizona? Yes. It's just as the silver state is her best of the seven. My sources agree that Arizona is the best, his best of the seven. All right. Let's move east. Georgia, it's a tougher one. Trump is ahead. Trump is favored. I think Georgia will be the fifth or sixth state she won if she's doing really well. In other words, if she wins Georgia, it means she's going to win all the Great Lakes states and probably the silver state as well. So it's probably Trump's third best of them, probably. And I'd make him the favorite there. And my Democratic sources today would make him the favorite there as well. There is a reality of Democratic politics in Southern states, which is if you can increase the percentage of the vote that comes from black vote, which is called the contribution to the vote. So what percentage of the number of people who vote are black? And she can get her numbers back up to where Democrats typically are. Two big ifs. She'll win. But Trump is doing well with the young black men there and the normal way he wins states running up in exurbs and rural areas. All of the seven states have a pro-choice energy. In the two Western states, there's ballot measures that will help there. There aren't in the five others. But Georgia, the Atlanta metro area is very pro-choice, a lot of suburban women. So some combination of her swelling black vote, holding her own with black vote and suburban voters, particularly women, she could win it. But Trump is the favorite there.
