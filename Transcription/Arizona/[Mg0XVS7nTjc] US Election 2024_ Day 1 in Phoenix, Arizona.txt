 Kia ora and welcome to day one of RNZ's US election coverage here on the ground in the US. I'm Corin Dan and I'll be covering the election along with Nick Monroe over the next week and a half or so. And where are we and why are we here? Well we are in Phoenix Arizona and we are here because this state is one of the seven key swing states that will most likely determine who gets to the White House. For Kamala Harris, well this is almost like a backup plan state. If she can't win those three critical states on the east coast if you like, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, she would need the 11 electoral college votes here in Arizona to get across the line. Donald Trump obviously keen to block her and he is being well successful to date. He is ahead slightly in the polls although it's margin of error stuff and you can tell just how much both candidates want to win this state because they're both coming here on the night of Halloween to hold rallies and campaign events. So there is a lot to play for here. Big issues here in this state, the economy, the cost of living, abortion is a big issue with a ballot measure here to enshrine abortion in law. There's also the issue of the border. This is a border state with Mexico and the Republicans are really trying to whip up concern about illegal immigration. It's something that people in Arizona are certainly concerned about. So lots to talk about here on the ground in Phoenix, in Arizona over the next few days and we're going to bring it all to you.
