 Better story. We are ready for a President, Kamala Harris. I warned you. I warned you I got to go ahead and chant that. And the good news is Kamala Harris is ready to do the job. This is a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice, who need a champion. Somebody who was raised in the middle class, believes in the values that built this country, her way through college in McDonald's, served with distinction in every office she has ever held, who is as prepared for the job as any nominee for President has ever been. That's who Kamala is. And in the White House, she will have an outstanding partner in Governor Tim Walz. I love that dude. Tim is a veteran, he's a teacher, he's a coach, he's a hunter, been a great governor, working with Democrats and Republicans to get stuff done. And I learned the other day, he can take a vintage truck apart and put it back together again, which is just cool. You think Donald Trump can do that? For that matter, do you think Donald Trump has ever changed a tire in his life? He's like having Jeeves change his tire. The point is, I was just picturing it, the point is if you elect Kamala, they will not be focused on their problems, they will be focused on yours. They understand that too many folks not just here in Arizona but across the country are still struggling to pay the bills. Even though wages are steadily growing, even though inflation is finally slowing, the price of everything from health care to housing to groceries, it's still too high and it hurts. So the question is not whether or not we need to do some things different. The question is who's really going to do something different?
