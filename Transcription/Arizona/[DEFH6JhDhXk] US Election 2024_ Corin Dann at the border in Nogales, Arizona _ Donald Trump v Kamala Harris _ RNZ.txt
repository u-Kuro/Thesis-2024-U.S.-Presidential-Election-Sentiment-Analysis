 Kia ora everyone, we are in the border town Nohalas which is right on the border of Arizona and Mexico and this border issue, this wall behind me with the barbed wire is what is so critical and central to this US presidential election race. The border has been a massive issue, particularly the Mexican border over the last four or five years. There have been hundreds of thousands, millions of asylum seekers looking to come into America from many of those South American countries through poor poverty, through war, through all sorts of concerns. Now many of them are allowed to come in and seek asylum, they then face years waiting for a judge to decide whether they can stay. Now it is those millions waiting in America that have some Americans concerned and certainly has Donald Trump pushing hard with his rhetoric for much tougher rules around immigration. In fact he would like a mass deportation of illegal immigrants in America, many of whom have been bussed and sent around different states of America, what are known as sanctuary states. So yeah, interesting to come here, see this wall that is talked about, of course it runs for miles but not far enough, it's a huge border here and there are gaps and of course many asylum seekers, migrants will choose to walk across the desert in the hot sun and risk their lives to get into America. But one thing's for sure, this issue is a complicated one and it is going to take a lot to solve whoever wins the White House.
