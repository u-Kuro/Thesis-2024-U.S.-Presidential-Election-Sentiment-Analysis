 One of the big four issues frequently at the forefront of voters minds. According to recent polling by Noble Predictive about one in four Arizona voters say that immigration is the most important issue facing this country and it's not split evenly among demographics. Fewer than one in four Democrats, younger voters, Hispanic, women and college grads mark immigration as a top issue. Meanwhile more than one in four men, people with a high school education or less, white voters over 65 and Republicans say immigration is their top issue. Overall the top two issues in Arizona are almost always economy or immigration. The economy was rated higher during the Trump presidency but immigration rose to the top shortly after Biden's inauguration. NPI data does show that immigration has held the top spot since 2022 when they poll these top issues about 41% of the time. Another thing that we know Arizona Republicans really do drive the immigration issue but there are some policy issues where Democrats do agree. A recent poll by our partner Scripps News shows that four in five Arizona Republicans supportive of a border security and immigration policies ranging from mass deportations to making crossings a state-level crime to areas where Republicans and Democrats mostly agree putting limits on the current asylum program and a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. Finally immigration as a rising issue typically correlates with a rise in migrant encounters. This data set by the way is looking at voters across the nation so you can see that when migrant encounters rise by noticeable amount from month to month which is this green line here it also tends to rise in the minds of voters this blue line.
