 In mid-September 2023, polls conducted in Arizona between September 15th to 18th offered a snapshot of the potential 2024 U.S. presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. The poll results reflected an important battleground state with a history of tight margins in recent elections. Candidates Donald Trump, Republican versus Kamala Harris, Democrat. Key Findings Trump's Lead Early indicators suggested Donald Trump holding a slight edge over Kamala Harris in Arizona. His lead was often within the margin of error, meaning the race was competitive. Two, Harris's performance. Kamala Harris faced challenges in terms of popularity and name recognition compared to Trump. However, her support from Democratic voters, women, and minority groups showed potential to make the race close. Three, Swing Voters Independent voters and moderates were pivotal in Arizona. This group tended to be more unpredictable, leaning in different directions depending on the current political climate and the focus of the campaigns at the time of polling. Important Factors Immigration and Border Security Given Arizona's proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border, immigration remained a top issue, which typically favored Trump among conservative voters. Economy and Inflation Concerns over inflation and economic stability also played a significant role, with both candidates framing their economic messages to appeal to middle-class and working-class voters. Abortion and Women's Rights Harris's stance on women's rights and reproductive health was likely to attract younger voters and women, particularly after the Supreme Court's decisions affecting abortion rights. Candidate Favorability Trump, despite his high-profile legal challenges, retained strong favorability among the Republican base. Harris's favorability was generally lower, but the polls showed potential for growth as the campaign developed. Conclusion At the time of the mid-September polling, Arizona's electoral outlook remained uncertain, with Trump holding a small but not definitive lead. Both candidates needed to focus on key issues relevant to Arizona voters to secure the state's crucial electoral votes in the 2024 election. Keep in mind that polling is just a snapshot in time, and these results could shift as the election nears and voter sentiments evolve.
