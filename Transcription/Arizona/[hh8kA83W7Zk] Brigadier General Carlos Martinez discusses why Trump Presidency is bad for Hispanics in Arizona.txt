 And in particular in Arizona, I was trying to aim at those folks there, pointing out that they have run the danger under Trump and his rhetoric. We have seen the growth of hate groups, particularly over the last 20 years, and even more so, at a much greater rate, since Trump became president. I was personally a victim of one of those hate groups back in 2017. I was approached by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations to warn me that I was on an assassination list put together by a hate group in California because I had taken some stand in support of some minority. They had put a thousand dollar bounty on my head. I point out to them, and this is the key thing, this country was formed by immigrants, except for the Native Americans were all immigrants. These hate groups, particularly, I guess Hispanics, which is what Trump and his gang are really pushing hard on. The southern border, the Hispanics, there was 11 million illegal aliens. I want to point out that with Trump and his hate groups, just because you've been living here for 400 years, your family's been here for 400 years, as many of those in the Southwest have, or you're blonde and blue eyed, like many immigrants are, particularly some of many from Cuba. You will still be the target if your name is Garcia, or Rodriguez, or Martinez. It doesn't matter. These people will see you as a target. To defend yourself and your family and your children and grandchildren, it behooves us to stop this Trumpism that's taking over a large portion of the country.
