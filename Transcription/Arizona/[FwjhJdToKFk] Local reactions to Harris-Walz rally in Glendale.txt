 I'm Marissa Sarbak reporting from Glendale, Arizona, where Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz hosted a rally here earlier tonight. Many of the people that we spoke with coming into the arena told us they wanted to hear about three main issues from the pair, the border, the economy, and women's rights. I am personally very concerned about the border. Everything from immigration as well as support women's rights. My daughter for my four grand babies, for LGBTQIA plus rights, indigenous people of color, equal rights for everybody. A sea of blue cheering on the Democratic ticket for president and vice president in Glendale. Kamala is going to fight for our freedoms and not only just for our freedoms but for education. I'm an educator, I'm a middle school teacher and so that's what I heard. A handful of speeches leading up to the VP including Arizona Congressman Greg Stanton and Ruben Gallego, Senator Mark Kelly and former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, even Republican Mayor of Mesa John Giles, who announced his support of the Democratic ticket earlier this week. I'm going to hear that our local representatives were for her. I'm very excited about the Republican who is now for Kamala Harris. Many leaving with smiles on their faces, more excited for the momentum building in Arizona for this team. A reproductive rights, hoping to hear a lot about LGBTQ rights, environment, stuff like that. Totally heard that. I love the energy in there, it was great. With less than 100 days until election day, the Harris-Walls campaign continues their trek in Nevada this weekend.
