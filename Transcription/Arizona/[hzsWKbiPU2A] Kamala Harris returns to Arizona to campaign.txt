 605 now and Vice President Harris is set to make a return trip to our state today. According to the Harris campaign, the Get Out the Vote rally and concert will be held from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Phoenix at yet to be named location. Special guests include Mexican music group Los Tigres del Norte, who we're told will be performing. Harris' visit is part of her When We Vote We Win event featuring artists and bands mobilizing voters in key battleground states.
