 Also today Kamala Harris plans to tackle an issue considered one of her biggest weaknesses, border security. She said to visit the southern border in Arizona and make her case for handling the border crisis. Former president Donald Trump going after Harris before her trip. And whether you call her a borders are or just say that she was put in charge of the border doesn't make any difference. Same thing. She's done a horrible job and she'll be out there tomorrow standing probably in front of the wall that I built. Well Harris is expected to propose sending more agents to the border and new ways to target fentanyl trafficking.
