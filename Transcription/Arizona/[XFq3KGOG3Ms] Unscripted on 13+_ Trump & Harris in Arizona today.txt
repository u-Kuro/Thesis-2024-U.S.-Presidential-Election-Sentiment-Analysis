 you you Hey friends happy Thursday and happy Halloween Thanks for joining us for our un-thirteen plus I'm Anna Orsini I'm Karzinkar, you're happy Halloween It doesn't feel like Halloween No, it kind of feels like a Friday Like I kept telling people I'm saying happy weekend and I'm like oh it's Thursday Sad All of these holidays should fall on weekends Yes For like Friday nights so that people don't have to go to work the next morning Very true But I guess you can't really If only, fun fact, pumpkins are a fruit We just learned that before We did, so now the party you know Oh, too funny Little Halloween fact for your parties tonight and stuff Well we'll get to the Halloween fun here shortly Of course, I know I feel like everyone's so ready for the election It's gonna be over but first I do want to let you know that Trump and Harris are in Arizona today So the battle obviously continues for battleground states including Arizona So with the election now just five days away the focus is on Arizona And a couple of other states Harris will appear with the band Los Tigres, Don Norte and Phoenix While Trump will be joining Tucker Carlson for a live interview at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale So both Harris and Trump will then return to Michigan In the lead up to the election in a final push to win the toss-up state 13 news will be covering both events in Arizona today So make sure to stay with us for the very latest And as we talk about the election coming up Just a couple reminders for all of those voting deadlines So if you still have your early ballot it is too late to mail it back So the best option now is to fill it out and then drop it off at any voting location Through election day in person early voting ends tomorrow That is Friday, November 1st The County's 19 early voting sites will serve as emergency voting locations this Saturday And next Monday of course we know election day is Tuesday, November 5th Voting centers will be open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. But honestly I've been telling everyone just go vote now Why not? If you haven't already early voting sites are opened Again they will turn into emergency voting locations on Saturday and Monday Just make sure that you of course do it before next Tuesday Or on next Tuesday Don't be the person putting it off until Wednesday It won't matter at that point Sorry about that Well Vice President Kamala Harris broke barriers when she was named the first female Vice President of the United States And as we talk about this upcoming election historians say there's been a long list of women Who did kind of blaze a trail when it comes to our national politics For Washington correspondent Ashanti Ford joins us from the nation's capital with more on the women who helped shape our nation Women have played a major role in shaping this country From spearheading civil rights movements like Rosa Parks To pioneering aviation like Amelia Earhart And in the last 50 years women they have made major milestones in politics Which is still a space heavily dominated by men Women always have to work twice as hard And black women have to work four times as hard A truth that historian and American University professor M.J. Remsha Pabloska said didn't stop women from running for president But there were obstacles I think for male politicians they can kind of just like have a vibe Whereas women politicians I think have to work really really hard to cultivate that vibe And M.J. said that vibe over the years despite their education and long resume Came in the form of pop culture I do think that women in politics especially women who are running for high profile elected positions Have had to engage popular culture in ways that seem to me to be gendered M.J. is talking about female presidential nominees who use popular music artists to motivate voters Like Hillary Clinton in 2016 with Katy Perry or Vice President Kamala Harris who brought Beyonce out for a campaign rally I've never heard of Beyonce coming to a presidential rally That's one of the biggest things that had me get up and come today M.J. said both Shirley Chisholm who was the first African American to run for president And Geraldine Ferraro the first woman nominated for vice president by a major political party Relied heavily on fashion to stay connected to pop culture Shirley Chisholm for example like a fashion star you know just this great bright colors bright prints like really mod 60s cuts That became for her a calling card Geraldine Ferraro wore a lot of pantsuits So when we think about Hillary Clinton in pantsuits actually that goes back to Geraldine Ferraro So even though women didn't have the right to vote for president until 1920 They continued to find new ways to connect to voters Paving away for more women to be a part of positive change in the nation's capital And taking a gorgeous look outside on your Halloween 62 degrees right now We're just talking about how nice it feels out there finally feeling like fall we love to see it especially on Halloween We do have 13 first alert meteorologist Mallory Schnell here with us look at us in our orange and purple you've got the Halloween earrings Trying to go for the little witchy vibe I also have a spider in my hair Oh cute well if I was gonna have a spider in my hair that's the one I would want Not a real spider in my hair I know isn't it funny with like spiders ah but then around Halloween It's like all their fake spiders everywhere They're so cute yeah they're probably like why don't we get this treatment you're brown Probably a little mad about it No it's okay Good news is in my house they die year round so that's the truth anyways weather wise Great weather honestly lots of sunshine today Temperature is pretty much right at climate normal so that will put Sierra Vista at 75 Tucson at 81 this afternoon so great weather pretty much all throughout the day including four trick-or-treating this evening So we're not looking to break any records today Hot as high and 93 set back in 1916 cold as low 29 degrees set back way in 1900 The rainiest day still under half of an inch of rainfall but of course we're not tracking any of that today Average temperature is 82 for a high 53 for a low and your trick-or-treat forecast here is sunset just after 5 30 this evening Temperatures should stay in the 70s and to some before dipping down into the 60s at some point during the 7 o'clock hour Mostly clear to partly cloudy fantastic fantastic weather for trick-or-treaters tonight your upper level pattern here We do have some big changes on the way though this weekend with our next weather system diving in here Saturday night into Sunday also taking us through Monday you can see all those blues there it moves out early next week Likely by Election Day but then we could have more active weather throughout next week may not bring rain every time But we'll definitely reinforce the cool air that we do have in place so chances of rain staying dry through Saturday Rain chances return Sunday with mountain snow chance as possible as well so keep an eye on that 40% of some lingering moisture Come Monday before we dry back out in the meantime lots of sunshine temperatures in the 50s and lower 60s this morning And we will continue to warm up nicely today so once again 81 into sun 49 tonight We stay in the 80s Friday and Saturday before we fall back into the 70s even some 60s possible by Monday with those rain chances moving in especially Sunday But looking dry for now for Election Day next Tuesday with a high of 73 overnight lows stay chilly in the 40s and 50s So very fall like as we head into November even some rain should be great so we love to see it Yeah, finally yeah nice weekend ahead of us.
