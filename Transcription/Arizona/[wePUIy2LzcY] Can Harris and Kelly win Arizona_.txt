 and comment childless utterly ridiculous noxious what i really worry about heartbeat and welcome back to square off arizona senator mark kelly sure sounds like he's auditioning for the role of vp kamala harris's running mate kelly has reportedly been asked to submit personal information for vetting by harris's team he's one of several potential running mates on the democratic ticket but is kelly the favorite and can harris win our battleground state without him i'm joined by christine jones an attorney and former republican candidate for governor and adam kenzie democratic consultant at uplift campaigns welcome to you both good morning just want point out thirty one days ago joe biden was preparing right now for a debate with donald trump and then the world turned upside down and here we are so while uh... onto the news uh... vice president kamala harris is a likely democratic nominee there is a kind of harris honeymoon going on right now adam what does harris do for the democratic ticket that joe biden couldn't do presidential elections are often about base turnout and uh... it did a lot for that uh... we had some we had an enthusiasm deficit we like to say folks were as excited as we needed them to be and in forty eight within twenty four hours of of the change uh... being made uh... we have seen grassroots fundraising grassroots volunteering uh... it's been it's been a complete one eighty and uh... uh... you know folks used to wake up and do scroll now they wake up and joy scroll there is just a there's a palpable energy that she is brought to the race joy scroll joy scrolling it's a new thing is joy scrolling enough for kamala harris to win arizona where joe biden was behind in the polls well behind your point about the honeymoon period is well-taken right so she's going to get this period of of of joy and and effervescence and fundraising and all of those things but no it's not enough obviously who she picks and what she does substantively for the next one hundred days or ninety nine days or wherever we are now now that the world is upside down is what matters right and for her and adam you have to deal with this she has a record and we know here in arizona especially what she has and hasn't done and so if the message is you messed up the border the enthusiasm will come back and we'll start to see the numbers actually i think sort of normalize around the actual support as opposed to just sort of the convention bump that you see both parties get i think if if if the race is about the records i think vice president harris wins uh... pretty pretty substantially because the record is really impressive uh... we have uh... uh... the largest infrastructure investment we've ever had in our country we're putting more people back to work for lowering the strych and drug prices capping insulin doing all these things that are really important lowering the cost for everyday americans when it comes to the border i think donald trump really did a disservice to himself and his party by blocking the by part or infrastructure by part or bipartisan border security deal that even the the the the border patrol union supported uh... he said i want the issue not the policy so he killed it and that was a big mistake because that would have been a substantive uh... difference in the posted and yet in voters minds you have to knowledge that kamala harris rightly or wrongly and i'm not sure it's entirely correct but she has been painted at the as the borders are the immigration czar and immigration until you know thirty one days ago was one of the number one issues one of the top issues in arizona so well and i love the notion of the democrat talking points and and congratulations adam is excellent at his job but voters know voters know their groceries are more expensive their gasoline is more expensive their rent is more expenses expensive and if you live in a border state they know that there is an issue with the border you can talk about all of your policy accomplishments and uh... name call you want the fact is voters know what they feel and what they feel matters by the way hats off to senator kiersten cinema if you guys really care that much about the infrastructure bill you'd be running her again and you're not well she is independent well because only because well we don't need to get well and i think you need to drag and i think i want to know i do have a little little hypocrite the border gives us a chance to bring in mark kelly uh... into the conversation i can ask you both not to be homers on this i know can be hard uh... one of your own is is up there but what does kelly bring as a potential running mate in particular to the border conversation not just in arizona but around the country words an issue issue in the northeast in the midwest you know i go back to this bipartisan border security deal i mean i was something that he was very uh... very much in favor of an instrumental in in developing in it was killed for political reasons by republicans uh... and and you see things like that you know mark mark kelly is not as not a liberal democrat he is uh... he is moderate he matches the state very well and border security is one of his top priorities and he's always voted accordingly and he's worked accordingly so i think having a border senator on the ticket certainly helps out uh... in it there are a number of ways that that senator kelly would help that ticket out not least which being an incredible background including you know raised by two police officers flew for space shuttle missions thirty nine combat missions over iraq but the in in terms of your specific question about the border i think he absolutely uh... can speak to it in a way that other contenders for the vice presidential nomination camp who would republicans least want as a running mate for kamala harris fair question and first of all with respect to senator kelly i don't disagree with that i think he is strong typically in the vice presidential sweepstakes we say do no harm he may be at a person who actually could add because he has this incredible story arc interestingly similar to jaydee vance's right there both military you'll get the navy marine corps battle going on where working events in the base as i don't think jaydee vance wants to get well i think that comparison all day on the military right where that were very very important for says that we like to make it always give us a right to go to the real fighting all of those things will come out who do the republicans want right the republicans want somebody who's not gonna screw it up because we know that kamala harris will if god forbid she wins and that's what americans who care about the country want there are other choices that are also good that harris could and should look at right there's the minnesota governor tim waltz who has come up and done you know a bunch of media is doing the shining very very nicely we obviously we we desperately need to drive some space between the super super progressive kamala harris and something more moderate on the vice presidential side so that would be helpful for us got ended there when we come
