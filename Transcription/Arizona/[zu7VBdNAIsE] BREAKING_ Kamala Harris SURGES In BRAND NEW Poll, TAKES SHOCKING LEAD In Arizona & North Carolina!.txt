 Okay, so we've got breaking news here. So there's a fresh off the presses new poll that has come out that is showing that Kamala Harris is surging absolutely surging in the Sunbelt states now I did do a video yesterday Where it was about how Harris has opened up a second path to victory according to the post polling model So there's actually now a second path to victory that's available and you can see this from these polls So what could happen in the election is you can either have an outcome where the traditional outcome would be You win the rust belt states and you could lose actually all of the Sunbelt you could even lose in Nevada It doesn't matter right you can lose all of them as long as you win the rust belt You would still reach the 270 required to win right the Democrats could win with 270 However, there's now another path that has opened up according to the polling Which is where you lose you win zero of the rust belt states none you win, Nevada, Arizona Georgia and North Carolina and you still win the election So you're actually able to win this election by winning zero rust belt states which in and of itself is super unlikely But it gives you two full paths to victory here And the other thing is you can always do wombo combos of both. So maybe you get Wisconsin but lose Georgia and saw something of that combination, you know There's all these different wombo combos you can run with but Kamala Harris has officially Opened up a second path to victory and this is huge because Joe Biden was getting Fudging destroyed in the race in these Sunbelt states. He was getting hammered. So here's what the numbers say So it's his New York Times Sienna polling shows VP Harris has put the Sunbelt back in play in May Trump led Biden by an average of 10 points in these States now, it's effectively a dead heat So like an average 10-point swing and we'll look at the swings in each individual state absolutely massive, so They have here they have Arizona 50 to 45 in favor of Harris. It's a huge massive lead We can actually look at the Arizona average for the 2024 race actually point six Is the lead and then we can even see where Biden was at? So Biden was actually at a plus 5.5 So this is massive. And so even in their poll, I think they had her him down five so basically has been a 10-point swing which is unfathomable and This is actually a big thing that made Biden's race really hard was that he didn't have the second path But he was entirely dependent on the rust belt. He was completely dependent So commonly Harris is increasing her odds of winning the election Not necessarily because she's gonna destroy Trump in any given state, but rather she's had more paths to victory through states, right? Another one. This is fudging massive. So North Carolina Kamala Harris has taken the lead in this poll. She is up 49 to 47 North Carolina is huge and if you look back at this 270 to win map we can see NC is 16 electoral votes You could do a one-to-one replacement of Wisconsin or Michigan by just winning North Carolina Because it's worth so many electoral votes. It actually matches Georgia and see is absolutely massive And by the way, Trump has to win all of these to be able to win Kamala can win either one or the other or a wombo combo of both But Trump needs every single one to be able to win the election. Yes, we're in all of them Kamala doesn't need all of them, but NC is huge Also, I've been kind of tracking because I was curious about what's going on in NC and see there was a massive shift I should have pulled up the election results. My apologies massive shift in the election from 2016 to 2020 the margin shifted by I think two something points, but I Should note that Gary Johnson took like 3% in 2016 So and Jill Stein wasn't on the ballot. So if that if he's not on the ballot, this Trump's margin even higher So maybe it's a three to four point shift. So It's from the Office of State Budget Management It says North Carolina strong population growth continues the US Census Bureau's latest population estimates show North Carolina continues to grow by leaps and bounds So you can see just by this little graphic There's third in new people in new people in the state or population growth. So they're having high net migration It looks like to the state of North Carolina and it looks like the main Driver that is into the blue counties not into rural areas or any of that for those kinds of areas So I think they've actually been continuously adding more and more blue people even between 2020 even between 2020 they're the third largest state in net migration. So Says number of people moving to North Carolina far exceeds those leaving other states and abroad since April 1st 2020 There was an estimated net gain of three seventy six thousand people due to net migration This accounted for 95% of total population growth between the April 1st 2020 and July 1st 2023 so it's likely that this could actually shift in favor of Democrats because of this large demography change That's going on in the state of North Carolina and this would be absolutely game-changing be huge again It actually gives you a pathway to win without being dependent on the rust belt So you don't have to basically hope and pray and just kind of pander non-stop to the rust belt You have a whole another pathway to victory and so we can see the North Carolina numbers in the polling data So we check out the North Carolina numbers in the polling data. We can see that The numbers are getting kind of close here. So Trump is up point nine in the aggregate here In This polling aggregate. So this is gonna do a lot for the polling aggregate where it's gonna push Harris More in the direction this might push her over in the lead I'm not exactly sure if you can see a lot of these polls are kind of right-wing pollsters is Trafalgar, which is a partisan pollster So there's there's a lot of these kinds of holes Redfield in Winton I believe Wilton, but I believe kind of leans red as well The cook political report actually has Harris up which cook political report is very heavily respected So North Carolina making huge huge gains and it wasn't even close with Biden. It wasn't even close Then we have Nevada Harris has now cut the lead down to one point in Nevada Nevada seems to be a weird holdout state Where as all the other ones, you know, Harris has taken the lead So she's she had taken the lead but now it's kind of like going away a little bit So point three so it seems to be a little bit stingy, but we have this Trump plus three from against your fall guard We have the tie from Redfield and lint Wilton. We have the plus three and plus five for Trump and the cook political report I think that there may be some difficulties for polling Democrats in the state of Nevada But I'm very confident that it's going to continue to grow in the Democrats his favor and I would be completely shocked if Nevada actually Ends up going red. But again big surges, you know, Biden was getting completely demolished in the state of Nevada He was losing by six points of the polls. I mean just just just fudging ridiculous man. Just absolutely ridiculous So it's like a six point surge basically four common here is like absolutely insane Georgia seems to be a kind of interesting one. So Georgia has Trump at 50% Harris at 46% This is highly highly unlikely also keep in mind that Democrats actually have been Have actually had benefits from polling errors themselves as well in these Sunbelt states So typically in the polling errors, they get overestimated then Trump is underestimated However, in these states the Democrats also get underestimated So for example, you know, we have in the state of Georgia, for example back in 2020 the lead is actually 1.2 Trump is at or Biden is at forty point six But he actually ends up outperforming his numbers by almost a full percentage point and they may think oh well, that's not that big of a deal That's huge that can swing an election and it did if he wasn't able to actually outperform his numbers He would have lost the election in Georgia But because he was able to outperform his own numbers He was able to win because he barely survived right but it could Trump over performed But because he also over performed with his already existing lead in the polls. He was able to win Arizona had something similar but it was a little bit smaller So they projected that Biden was gonna get 48 point 48 point seven However, he ended up getting about point seven points more which is significant again He was only able to survive because of that if he didn't over perform his poll numbers He would have done poorly so we can expect an overperformance also in the 2022 elections. There was a massive overperformance So like for example in the US Senate for Arizona in in 2022 Kelly was only up 1.5 But he ended up just absolutely Demolishing basically so he would he would he ended up winning by a significant significant margin So this is an interesting one Georgia seems to be a bit bit of a holdout in this NYT, Santa pollster We can look at kind of what's going on with the general election results For the state of Georgia. We can see that the numbers barely flipped back for Trump She had taken the lead by point two, but he took the lead back by point two I don't think there were any new polls added but we can see that It's a big outlier So I think the Georgia numbers don't really make sense that it really stay in line with kind of the other numbers Which is kind of interesting. I mean, it's plus two for Trump and then there's not really anything that has Trump this high But I can confidently say in a head-to-head There's no chance that Harris is getting 46 and I highly highly doubt that Trump is getting 50% I think Harris probably also is able to stem a lot of black voters in the state, which is gonna be a big deal But nevertheless Georgia also being an absolute massive shift so we can see here is You know Biden was down six points So she's basically done like a six point swing a lot of those are Kennedy voters who are switching a lot of double haters I think a lot of women so it's a big big deal So here are some of the margins that are shifting so We can see is this is an MIT Sunbelt polls big swing store Terrace AZ Harris up 47 to 43 in May Trump up 44 35 and an unfathomable change man He was down nine points. His swing is incredible, especially this fast. There's still a lot of ground to gain crazy amounts of ground to gain There was no pull done for North Carolina, Nevada Trump was actually up 44 to 30 So it is an absolutely unfathomable shift in favor of Harris and again This is going to continue to grow in my personal belief That's like a 14 point shift pretty much even larger than that or not larger than that maybe like 12 point shift net And then in May Trump was up 42 to 34 in the state of Georgia in this poll So a massive massive unbelievable shift So we have this huge huge Polling boost basically so really really massive shifts and then we also have a large large change in the down ballot races as well So for the NC governor race Josh Stein is up 49 to 39 and the Nevada Senate senator Rosen is up 49 to 40 Which is similar to the cook pool and the Arizona Senate guy goes up 51 to 42 The Senate races are super important as well because it's actually possible for the Democrats to win a trifecta Where they're able to win the Senate and the house the generic ballot polling has the Democrats up by about 1.1 points Which is big. It's like the first time in a long time That's really happened the Senate also could go 50-50 if Montana holds a tester holds a seat I think I think I think the movie pen incumbents are really strong so I think they all hold their seats and then I think that a guy ego wins his race and Hopefully tester is able to hold I think Sherrod Brown also winning his race. So Here the here are the shifts that they have so they have in the head-to-head They have a Democrat plus 11 shift This is going from the Biden Trump polls from April 29 to May 9th versus the August 8 to 14th Poll so there's a head-to-head shift AZD plus 11 GAD plus 5 and Nevada D plus 12 full field is when the full field is in play AZ is D plus 13 shift Georgia's D plus 5 and envy is D plus 10 It's the second poll since November showing a damn beat in North Carolina So you can see this little graphic here So if the 2024 presidential election were held today Who would you vote for if the candidates were Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and you can see in Arizona the state Harris has 50% to 45% North Carolina 49 47 Nevada 47 48 Georgia 46 50 so completely different race. It's flipped its head in like a couple weeks or months So basically there's a lot of ground to begin There's still a lot of double haters out there who reportedly have not decided yet according to poll numbers huge race Second pathway to victory opened up that is completely independent of the rust belt states So it's super super interesting and see what's gonna happen There's lots of ground to be gained also keep in mind the states of the Sunbelt states don't have to worry so much about the polling errors Because back in 2020 there wasn't as bad of polling areas in Arizona and Georgia Whereas in all of the rust belt states the polling errors were massive. So it makes me feel better about the Sunbelt But I think they should do well with the you know black voters and minorities in those states and so she is completely surging in these states and I think that North Carolina taking the lead is absolutely insane and a five-point lead in Arizona is absolutely nuts And then in this Georgia poll they have 46 to 50 which is pretty surprising Highly unlikely I think very very unlikely But super fascinating see Kamala Harris surging in the Sunbelt opening up a second path to victory
