 Well, good morning, long lines in Connecticut, Texas, and South Carolina, where early in-person voting started yesterday. But the focus remains on the several battleground states that will decide this election. With two weeks to go until election day, new polling from the Washington Post shows a tight race in every battleground state. Vice President Kamala Harris with the edge in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Former President Trump in Arizona and North Carolina, each state is within the margin of error. Christians will not be safe with Kamala Harris as president of the United States. Trump rallied with faith leaders in North Carolina last night, claiming without evidence the Justice Department labels Catholics as potential domestic terrorists. If you're Catholic, there is no way you can be voting for these people. Trump surveying the hurricane damage in that state. FEMA has done a very poor job. Repeating false claims about FEMA spending money on migrants. It's just untrue. It continues to be falsehoods and lies, and it is impacting the people and their perception of what they can get. Harris yesterday with three stomps in three battleground states. Do we want a president of the United States who spends full time plotting revenge while they sit in the Oval Office or a president who is actually focused on the American people? Harris in Michigan campaigning alongside former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, who made this pitch to conservative voters. For anybody who is a Republican who is thinking that, you know, they might vote for Donald Trump because of national security policy, I ask you please, please study his national security policy. Not only is it not Republican, it's dangerous. And today Harris with no campaign event scheduled, Trump has a roundtable with Latino leaders in Florida and a rally in North Carolina.
