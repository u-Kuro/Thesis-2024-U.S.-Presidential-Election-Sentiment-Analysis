 With just 10 days left before election day, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in the key battleground state of Michigan on Saturday. In Kalamazoo, former First Lady Michelle Obama rallied with Harris. It was the first time the two have been together on the campaign trail. Believe me, if Donald Trump is president again at some point or another, that ugliness will touch all of our lives. And it will not matter what you look like, how you worship, who you love or how you vote. Harris repeated her warnings on the dangers of the Trump presidency, a big part of her message in the final days of the campaign. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. He who will claim unchecked and extreme power if he is re-elected. He who has vowed he will be a dictator on day one. He who has said he wished he had generals like Hitler's. Trump was in Novi on the outskirts of Detroit. He didn't appear alone. Some of the state's Muslim leaders took the stage to say this. We as Muslims stand with President Trump because he promises peace. He promises peace, not war. It was a scene that would have been improbable during Trump's presidency when he enacted a ban blocking immigrants from seven majority Muslim nations. But some of the state's sizeable Arab American population are angry at the current administration's support for Israel. Trump is basking in it. Winning overwhelming support from the Muslim and Arab voters right here in Michigan. Can you believe me? It could influence a race too close to call. This state was once part of what was called the Blue Wall, a reliable win for Democrats. But since then the margins have become way for thin. In 2020, Joe Biden took it by just 150,000 votes. And this time around the polls show Kamala Harris and Donald Trump neck and neck. Here it seems every vote really will count. John Holman, Al Jazeera, Kalamazoo, Michigan.
