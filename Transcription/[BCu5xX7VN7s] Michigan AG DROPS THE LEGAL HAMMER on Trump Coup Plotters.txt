 As part of the orchestrated plan, we allege that 16 Michigan residents met covertly in the basement of Michigan GOP headquarters and knowingly and of their own volition, signed their names to multiple certificates stating that they were the duly elected and qualified electors for President and Vice President of the United States of America for the state of Michigan. That was a lie. They weren't the duly elected and qualified electors and each of the defendants knew it. They carried out these actions with the hope and belief that the electoral votes of Michigan's 2020 election would be awarded to the candidate of their choosing instead of the candidate that Michigan voters actually chose. This is Michael Popak, Legal AF with Breaking News. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has figured out a way to thread the needle, stay away from the federal prosecution of Donald Trump and the fake electors and all that that goes into a conspiracy yet bring to justice 16 members of the Michigan GOP Republican Party who met in a basement and signed fraudulent certificates of election as electors which they weren't to try to give the election to their candidate of choice Donald Trump and away from what the Michigan voters wanted, which was of course President Joe Biden and now they've been brought to justice by Dana Nessel who with the permission of a magistrate judge at Ingram County has indicted 16 of these fake electors. They've gotten hit with felony charges under Michigan state law that range in possible prison sentences from five to 14 years and this was a very artful way for the Michigan Attorney General who sits under the Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Remember herself the victim of a kidnapping plot and conspiracy. I don't know what's going on in Michigan but or what's in the water there but this was a one of the many fake electors scandals that happened in seven battleground states and Michigan and its flinty Attorney General is not taking it lying down. Now look she made her referral as many other Attorney Generals did to Jack Smith ultimately uh ultimately went to Jack Smith but it was to Merrick Garland originally saying hey we got these fake electors right who tried to meet clandestinely and signed with wax seals and and you know feather quill pens some sort of phony elector certificates and try to throw sand in the gears of democracy. What do you want to do about it? We're either going to go after them ourselves criminally for all of the Michigan and state law crimes they committed or Jack Smith you're going to do it and now watching nine months of Jack Smith indicting for Mar-a-Lago Donald Trump about to indict because we got the announcement on the same day within hours of Dana Nessel taking the podium. We have the information that of course Jack Smith sent a target letter to Donald Trump that he's about to indict Donald Trump a second time this time in the District of Columbia for we imagine part of that indictment it's going to be about fake electors. So so how did Dana Nessel both come up with a robust muscular state-based approach and get out of the way of Jack Smith impossible preemption or big footing by the federal prosecutors of her case and yet look Michiganders in the eye and say I'm doing right by you as the top lawyer top cop in in Michigan she indicts and she indicts just the fake electors she doesn't make it a broader a broader conspiracy though she could have and brought in everybody else including Donald Trump and John Eastman of Rudy Giuliani and everybody else she didn't do that she focused uniquely on just her citizens her residents of Michigan and brought a count or so against each one of them and that's the way she can maintain her own case at the same time Jack Smith goes after Donald Trump and the others and the other states this could be a model for the other states we're seeing for instance in Arizona the Attorney General doing about the same thing she's just further behind she's not ready to indict she's developing her evidence but I expect now based on you know Dana Nessel breaking that glass ceiling of prosecutors state prosecutors others will do the same thing because they'll say it can be it can be plus it can be two it doesn't have to be well we have to wait to see what the feds do about our own criminals in our own midst we can do it too I think this is going to be a real blueprint and a road model and hats off to Dana Nessel the Attorney General Attorney General Nessel for doing that let me just give because it's important for transparency who we're talking about and what we're

house of Michigan even the leadership in the state house the speaker of the house for Michigan right and also the majority leader for Michigan went in November 20th of that year to the White House to meet with Donald Trump and they came away and issued a press statement that said yeah yeah we met with the president but we didn't really see anything that indicates that this wasn't a fair election or that anything was unfair about Michigan or that its votes should go somewhere else well apparently 16 people that met in the basement of the GOP headquarters and you can't make this stuff up thought otherwise they thought there was a way to steal the election from Joe Biden and undercut the will of the people in their own state and hand deliver the the the presidency to the person that they wanted not the people that michigan michigan people wanted but even the leadership in the state house thought that was crazy uh but wasn't crazy enough for these people who are these people well let's just run it down Kathy Bearden age 70 Hank Chote 72 Amy Fachinello 55 Clifford Frost 75 Stanley Grot 71 John Haggard 82 Mary Ann Henry 65 Tim King 56 I'm reading out there their ages so you know these aren't children these people know better you know these are you know 50 60 70 and 80 year olds in in the state of Michigan Michelle Lundgren 73 Miss Shawn Maddock 55 James Renner 76 Myra Rodriguez 64 Rose Rook 81 Mary Ann Sheridan 69 Ken Thompson 68 Kent Vanderwood 69 and of the 16 I just mentioned two in particular Kathy Bearden is on the Republican National Committee and his close friends with its chairperson Rona McDaniel Mitt Romney's niece and Michelle Maddock former co-chair of the Michigan GOP you have been indicted by your attorney general and here here is the indictment everybody gets the same swag bag from the attorney general Nessel everybody gets that I just listed one count of conspiracy to commit forgery which is a 14 year possible felony two counts of forgery a 14 year felony one count of conspiracy to commit uttering and publishing usually means a false statement a 14 year felony one count of uttering and publishing a false statement another 14 year felony one count of conspiracy to commit election law forgery a five-year felony and two counts of election law forgery a five-year felony and the the attorney general's office we we've heard her statement at the top of this hot take of attorney general Nessel but they went on to say in a written press statement that the false electors actions undermine the public's faith in the integrity of our elections and we believe also plainly violated the laws by which we administer our elections in Michigan my department meaning the attorney general of Michigan's department has prosecuted numerous cases cases of election law violations throughout my tenure and it would be malfeasance for the greatest magnitude of the greatest magnitude if my department failed to act here in the face of overwhelming evidence of an organized effort to circumvent the lawfully cast ballots of millions of Michigan voters in a presidential election couldn't have said it any better than attorney general Nessel I don't think this is going to be the end I think this is the blueprint all attorney generals in the battleground states can use to both establish their own territory get their own piece of turf and real estate to go after their citizens involved in the fake electors and kind of stay away from this sprawling more conspiracy oriented set of charges and indictments brought by either Jack Smith which would include Donald Trump and or Fawny Willis the Fulton County DA who is also looking at places like Michigan and the as part of her conspiracy but this is a perfect thread the needle right this is putting a camel through the eye of the needle in the form of let's just go after our state's bad people alleged bad people and we'll do that and we'll stay away from Jack Smith's prosecution and we can live harmoniously side by side as parallel prosecutors and that's that's what attorney generals who are the top prosecutors for each state can do if you do it the way that attorney general Nessel did I'll follow on breaking news and otherwise an analysis developments just like this one at the intersection of US law and politics here only on the Midas Touch Network I do
