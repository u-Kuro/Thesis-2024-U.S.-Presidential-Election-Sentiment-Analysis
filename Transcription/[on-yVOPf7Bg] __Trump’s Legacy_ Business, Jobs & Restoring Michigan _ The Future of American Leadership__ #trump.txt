 President Trump earned his respect. He earned the votes that he received in 2016. He was a businessman, and the Black community knew him, but certainly by the ventures that he had as a businessman. But they also trusted that he would do what he said he would do, make America great again, and provide the resources to the communities, especially communities of color, the unemployment rate, the jobs and opportunities, and he did that. And so he has earned the respect, he has a record, for which we can be proud of. We were energy independent. I was paying $1.87 in gas here in Michigan when he left office. And so we are very proud of him here in Michigan and the work that he's doing. And we know that he will handle the business of Michigan again. We are looking forward to making Michigan great again and making our nation great again. We're looking for godly leadership, and we're looking for righteous leadership and good stewardship. And right now, we don't have that stewardship.
