 Alright man, so we got some absolutely massive news here for Kamala Harris in the state of Pennsylvania Now we've been keeping you updated about what's going on a big thing in 2020 that actually happened was the third party support was almost Non-existent or very muted and that was a big thing that also is able to let Biden win in 2020 as opposed to 2016 Where there was a lot of third party support because Hillary was obviously, you know, not not a really great candidate So a lot of people ended up voting third party 2020 was a different scenario because it was so dire with Covid and everything and so he was able to win So what we have here is this article says Cornell West can't be on Pennsylvania's presidential ballot court decides So Cornell West of course, he's like a left-wing dude who's running He was definitely pulling some votes from Kamala Harris and definitely more from Kamala Harris and Trump So it says Cornell West can't be on Pennsylvania's presidential ballot court decides. It says independent presidential candidate Cornell West lost the legal challenge Friday in his bid to get on the ballot in the ballot ground battleground state of Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court judge Renee Cone Jubileerer in a 15 page opinion sided with the Secretary of State's office under Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro in rejecting West candidacy paperwork The Secretary of State's office said West campaign lacked or card affidavits for 14 of the West 19 presidential electors So what I think is kind of going on to I don't know if that's the case here But what it looks like is I guess a lot of the states required maybe in addition to signatures also these electors who are Promising to vote for you But what ended up happening in the state of Arizona? There was a lot of controversy because Cornell West attempt to get on the ballot was actually being aided by Republican lawyers who were trying to make sure he could get on and so What the interviews of a couple of the electors said was they're like, hey when it was just Biden I was down with Cornell, but ever since Kamala was chosen. It just completely flipped again I have personally have no idea why they're basically the same person but What ended up happening was, you know politically at least right Paul policies was but what happened was like, oh, yeah No, I'm good now. I'm done. So a bunch of them actually looks like Renee I don't know if that's what happened in this case or not But that's what happened in the state of Arizona and one of the electors is affidavit was just completely forged I think it's kind of a bad look for Cornell West It looks really sus and super shady and it looks really really just sus and kind of weird It says Jubilee or Republican agree to Secretary of State's office that minor party presidential electors are to be considered candidates for office Who must file affidavits even if major party presidential electors are not the court case among a raft of presidential legal maneuvering around third-party candidates as backer of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris aimed to derail third-party candidates who might siphon away support or to Help others whom I heard their opponent. There's also big two because of RFK dropping out. He's he's technically not dropped out He's suspended his campaign in swing states is gonna stay on the ballot in blue and red states So that's gonna give her a boost so Cornell not being on these ballots is absolutely huge These margins are gonna be really small like in the state of Michigan, for example, you know, the margin was 0.23% so We can actually take a look here over at the you know polls right now in Pennsylvania So in the polls in Pennsylvania right now Harris is up by 1.8 Which is solid, but I do believe if she wishes to wish to win the state of Pennsylvania She's gonna have to perform better than this. Biden was actually up by about 4.5. He ended up winning only by about 1.2 So you have to be aware of that error And so I think she really needs to get this number up if she wants to win I think she will I think the DNC boost would probably kick in and there'll be some of those kinds of boost still out there But you know what we can see if we go down these polls A lot of these polls don't actually contain him But like this signal poll has him at 2% which is really significant like 2% is absolutely massive. So I Know that a lot of you guys are gonna say oh, well, this is not a big deal Most of Cornell's voters are gonna go elsewhere anyways, but the thing is is for Cornel West It doesn't matter necessarily like where the votes go in terms of like, okay, maybe you're thinking well Hey, even if like point seven of his 1% or his hundred percent of voters like goes towards, you know Jill Stein or nobody else. The thing is it's all about margin So for example, even if he's a one percenter, let's say Kamala Harris can win that by a point three margin against Trump Let's say for example, you know point five goes to Stein, you know point one stays home and then you know She gets point three. He gets point one. That's a point two margin. That's huge. That's a net margin of point two That's huge So any one or two percent is massive even if you don't get anywhere close to most of it Even if at a two percent you get point four but Trump only gets point one That's huge because that's a point two margin and likely you'd probably getting even larger than that. So to this two percent is huge This one has a zero so some of these polls have and this is another one that has West at two percent the bull Finch group these ones have some pretty crazy polls going on right now for for Kamala Harris And so they have West here at two some of the other ones have zeros This one has one so he's definitely pulling at some numbers in some of these polls for sure and a lot of them He's not included and then in others he's getting zero like in this one and some of the other ones But zero might also be rounded down. So it might be like I don't know bless me point four or something or whatever Trust me. This is a really really big deal for the race Because again even like the smallest of a margin if you have two percent 1.5 votes time and then you get point four and Trump gets point one. That's a point three margin. That's huge Absolutely massive. And so this is really interesting here And so what we can see in this state also in the state of Pennsylvania was going to come really close is so there's this article It talks about how Pennsylvania slipping from Donald Trump's grasp and it says Kamala Harris gains ground with crucial Hispanic voters in swing state That could decide 2024 election. There's another really really huge thing for Kamala Harris So what's happened is there's been a really large surge of Hispanic population in the state of Pennsylvania So there's numbering roughly 600,000 adults in a state that was settled by margins of less than 100,000 votes in the past two elections Pennsylvania's Hispanics are where the votes are we seem to be committing an unforced error said Albert Eisenberg almost as Einstein a Philadelphia-based Republican consultant his Spanish could be the deciding factor It says that they've been taught they've been running Spanish language elections I've never seen a campaign starts early as Biden usually would be in September said Victor Martinez owner of Pennsylvania's largest bench Spanish language radio network And the anchor of his own morning show from Allentown So his his support amongst Hispanics was pretty low actually This is what confuses me is why the Trump campaign is not even trying to reach Spanish speakers as a businessman I would go broke if I ignored my fastest growing audience Harris has also done a phone-in interview with Martinez in English So there's a huge surge going on and also these people I think are young they're young skewing so the Proportion of Hispanic voters who are actually going there are actually Disproportionally young which are obviously going to be disproportionately Democrats, so it's absolutely huge. This can also turn the election for Kamala Harris. So This is an absolutely massive thing for her which is her ability to get these as well in the state And so she needs to continue she's surging right now as it pertains to Hispanic voters and so hopefully she'll be able to keep it up I do have actually a hot take that I'm kind of toying with as well and that's I think that Pennsylvania is actually more likely to go blue than Wisconsin and so the reason why I actually say that is because for the poll numbers Pennsylvania here You can see was won by about 1.2 If we go through and we check the polls back in 2020 for Pennsylvania Joe Biden's up 4.7, right? He's up 4.7. He ends up he ends up winning the election in total He wins by 1.2 So if he wins by 1.2 and the polls are saying about 4.7 he the polls were off by about 3.5 Now the Wisconsin results You can see here you're only won by 0.7 this looks really close to this 20,000 votes It's pretty crazy if we look at the Wisconsin numbers though, check this out. So Wisconsin 8.6% lead for Biden and he only ended up winning by 0.7 So you can see that it was a absolutely massive or 7.9 on Election Day We'll say 7.9 and he she only win one by point seven so or it's 8.4 on Election Day So he only won by point seven. So that's like a you know, I mean like a 7.3 You know percent polling errors almost twice just for reference His lead was double in Wisconsin versus what it was in Pennsylvania But the amount he won by was basically double in the reverse order. So he won by half the amount You know in Pennsylvania's he didn't Wisconsin or vice versa, right? So you might think oh, well, maybe 2020 was an outlier but If you look at these Wisconsin polls here these Wisconsin polls I averaged this out It's like three point four for or not three point four This one is I think like five point four or something something around there and then the Wisconsin 2016 results She loses by one point so they're off by like four point four point four or something more than that And then the Pennsylvania numbers here when you look at the Pennsylvania averages here, it's a much much better. You can see In terms of you know, the the Pennsylvania numbers here, so It ends up being much closer than Wisconsin was the Wisconsin numbers are much nicer Do you have six is a bunch six is sevens, etc. So these look really nice for Wisconsin, right? Pennsylvania we have here looks much much lower these I think average off like three point four and Pennsylvania, you know, she ends up losing by looks like one point two So it's not off by as much so happened in 2016 as well. So my hot take personally is Pennsylvania is actually more likely to go blue than Wisconsin is and I think I think Cornell was dropping out even further presses that But it'll be interesting to see if this does end up handing out this little hot take that I'm towing with here But it happened in 2020 and 2016. So it's pretty interesting Cornell West no longer on the ballot, which is huge Even if it's just like one or two percent like if she can net some kind of tiny margin be absolutely massive in Pennsylvania and then also the Hispanic voters that are surging in The state of Pennsylvania can also give her the election. So a lot of stuff growing in Pennsylvania Her Hispanic numbers generally going up and I actually think Pennsylvania is more likely to go blue than Wisconsin Which is actually better because Pennsylvania is 19 electoral votes Pennsylvania under or Pennsylvania is 19 Wisconsin is just 10 so much much better to win Pennsylvania than Wisconsin
