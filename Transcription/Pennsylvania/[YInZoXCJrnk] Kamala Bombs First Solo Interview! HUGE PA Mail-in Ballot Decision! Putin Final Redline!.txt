 all right so Kamala Harris had a sit-down interview with a local station and they asked her about her economic plan and she basically repeated the same thing that she always says the interviewer wanted to get some details on her economic plan so she says that well I'm from the middle class and blah blah blah blah opportunity economy blah blah blah blah I was gonna actually react to it right here but I'm just so sick of her saying the exact same thing it's ridiculous it's pretty pathetic at this point she's gonna give $25,000 new homeowner home buyers which makes those first of all where's this tax credit gonna come from where are they gonna find the money for all this and even if they do okay let's say you give away $25,000 to somebody who's looking to buy a home or whatever okay well then if you're selling a home if you're selling a home naturally you're gonna raise the price of the home by $25,000 because you now know that this person has access to $25,000 from the government anyway she says she wants to build 3,000 new homes or apartments or whatever okay yeah how are you actually gonna do that you know it's just really embarrassing at this point she can only perform on a really controlled environments which made the debate really frustrating obviously the moderators supported her as much as they could attack Trump as much as they could Trump's still fail to just expose her but I'm not gonna dwell on that we still have a little more time to go in this campaign and it's pretty obvious that she has nothing new to offer as far as a plan she just repeats what she's been coached to say and that's all we're really dealing with here so she gets into the White House who's actually gonna be running the show seriously but she have any ability to actually do this job she talked about her economic plan she has no experience whatsoever running large organizations companies corporations or anything governments even she was an attorney attorney general of California prosecutor in San Francisco she became a US senator but I mean where's a real practical experience actually running large organizations the answer is she doesn't have any and she doesn't really need any because she's not gonna be running this show so there you go thanks for watching thanks for listening and don't forget the future belongs those who bear for today and speaking of the election there has been some good news as far as the election is not all gloom and doom as far as World War three and all this other stuff there are has been a ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and it's really good news for Trump essentially they're saying that mail-in ballots without correct dates will not be counted so you can't be submitting mail-in ballots without the right dates so some good news right there they have to have some type of standards put in place and let me say this one more time about elections you cannot have a situation where it takes three days to count the damn votes the system loses all credibility system loses all credibility when that happens and going back to the world situation with Ukraine the problem with the Ukraine using long range missiles given to them by the US and UK is that they need satellite satellite technology they don't have the technology and expertise actually utilize these long range missiles without direct involvement from NATO that means the United States means to UK and if they're in a situation where they're they get to okay from the United States and UK NATO to actually use these long range missiles in Russia Russia's there Putin is saying that it means that Russia is gonna be a war with NATO now what does that really mean does that mean they're gonna the Russian Navy is gonna take on the US Navy the US has the best Navy I say that much it doesn't mean nuclear weapons is I mean tactical weapon tactical tactical nukes been used throughout Europe what does that really mean that's the question I do know this Putin has set red lines before and they don't has crossed them over and over again so at this point does anybody in London and Washington really take Russia seriously do they take Putin seriously now right now the Washington is sort of pulling back with this idea we've seen this in the past where somebody in Europe or suggest a let's do cross this red line and Washington says well I don't know about that but then later on it come around say well okay go ahead and do it we've seen this pattern play out over and over and now Putin is saying that a if you cross this red line we know we will consider NATO to be directly involved in this conflict what is it what what what exactly will be the consequences what is Russia gonna do I mean that's the big question there's talk that maybe Russia can do a demonstration of a nuclear test they haven't done that since 1990 I don't think that's gonna be effective in deterring NATO because at this point a lot of people in NATO believe that a Russia is gonna do anything all right this is to say the world we have a presidential election where it's pretty obvious that we're in big trouble we're in very big trouble that's if we don't end up in World War three before then so do your best to take care of yourself take care of your family I wanted to range today enjoy that and I'll forget the future belongs to those who prepare for today
