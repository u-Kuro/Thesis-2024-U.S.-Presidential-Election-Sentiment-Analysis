 Where exactly does the race stand in a state that their candidates are spending a lot of their time this week? Yeah, most polling has Harris up by the narrowest narrowest of margins maybe one to two points So within the margin of error essentially it could go either way with the margin of error It's arguable that Donald Trump actually has the lead You could ask me this question every day from now until November 5th And I think the answer will be the same either candidate could really plausibly win it a small shift at any point Right up to election day could really change the outcome We start wondering what causes one campaign or the other to break out if anything They're both still laying out new policy proposals today Kamala Harris aiming a series of proposals that young black men with business incentives an effort to legalize Cannabis on the federal level Donald Trump continues to introduce tax deductions. They all lead us back to the economy Though and that is the state of Pennsylvania. Yeah, and the economy is something that has been the top issue throughout this campaign There's a lot of frustration still from a lot of voters about inflation Even though some of those numbers have come down more recently. They remember those early years of the Biden administration and And and that's why they're both candidates are trying to make those working-class appeals and trying to chip away where Trump is trying to win Some of those working-class black and Latino voters who maybe were Democrats in the past Harris trying to win back some of the white working-class voters who have been part of the Trump base because as we just said a Tiny tiny shift in any group could really make the difference Well as we consider working-class voters, obviously They are large populations in the rust belt in the blue wall specifically where it does seem Harris is Targeting more for energy at least this week for all of the conversation We had in the nascent days of her candidacy which arguably were still in Jonathan There was talk of an expanded map include the Sun Belt potentially she could be competitive in are we reverting now? I think the most straightforward path for Joe Biden and for Kamala Harris is winning, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin Those are three states that have always been close, but traditionally voted Democratic You know Arizona looks tough for Democrats. Georgia has only recently become competitive, North Carolina They have it once since Obama So those are the three states that are the most kind of straightforward path if she wins those she doesn't need anything else provided nothing else flips and so that's the most logical path and It appears to be the way that she's going to be most efficient a couple of important events on the campaign trail as we were just Showing our viewers on Bloomberg TV tomorrow Donald Trump high noon interview right here on Bloomberg TV and radio with our editor-in-chief John michaels wait Wednesday Kamala Harris sitting down for an interview with Brett bear on Fox News These are two important conversations that will be following closely and we'll invite you to our special coverage tomorrow starts 1130 Eastern Time As we walk up to the interview with Donald Trump now We want to turn to the Middle East another important story We're following today with some updates the Pentagon Announcing the US is sending more troops now almost a hundred along with an advanced missile defense system to Israel to help protect from attacks Coming from Iran this comes as Israel has yet to retaliate for the barrage of missiles that Iran fired earlier this month We spoke earlier today with former NSC official Hagar Shemali on the early edition of balance of power It is something that is meant to beef up that that that security to definitely send a message across to all Across the Middle East that the US is going to defend Israel is going to stand and support Israel You know in case of any kind of attack But it certainly indicates that there is they they are expecting something and they want to be there just in case Joined now by Bloomberg's Michelle Jim Risco at the table with us in Washington Michelle We've had a couple of updates not only that defense missile missile defense battery I should say on its way to Israel with dozens of Americans who will be there to run it But Benjamin Netanyahu according to the Washington Post Now saying that Israel will strike the Iran military when it responds We're not sure when that happens and that's as opposed to oil installations or nuclear facilities Does the Biden administration then in fact have some influence after all? I mean, I think it's a it's a stretch first to you know We don't know if these are verified reports. We have to you know, take a look ourselves But you know and there's there's constantly all these You know rumors flying about the private deliberations between the two leaders and the fraught relationship that they have so that is tentative if true Yes That's a you know somewhat of a relief I would say for US officials that were pressing that both privately and of course as we heard from Biden in public Much to the dismay of some Israeli officials who didn't want to be instructed on how to conduct this retaliation So it does I think relieve a little bit of pressure But I think we have to be reminded that this isn't you know, everything is is all good between the two powers there They're allies You know the US is at pains to continue to say, you know This is all for Israel's defense as you heard from Hagar Shemali You know, this is to send a message in addition to actually provide the resources needed to finish this war But you know, there will still be disagreements And I think the US has been honest about that even in public that you know They don't always agree and they're being candid with each other Which the subtext is, you know, this isn't a great relationship a warming of ties But it is something that they both sides want to move forward and finish this off Well, we certainly have seen a market reaction to the reporting from the Washington Post oil futures are down more than 4% Right now WTI lower by nearly five full percentage points south of seventy two dollars a barrel once again So when we consider the political impact here for the Biden administration Why they had been encouraging a less escalatory move from Israel not going after energy or nuclear sites for example It was because of concern about how Iran could respond and disrupt potentially global energy markets right or at least a factor and stability Has been the name of the game since you know a year ago when the October 7th attacks happened It's a US desperately just wants to bring down the temperature and in any way we can on all these fronts You know, of course, we've got Hezbollah with defeat of Hamas All you know in the balance now oil is a significant portion of this story and you can see as you mentioned the market reaction Underscores just how sensitive these conversations are about how Israel retaliates even if the US continues to say it's justified
