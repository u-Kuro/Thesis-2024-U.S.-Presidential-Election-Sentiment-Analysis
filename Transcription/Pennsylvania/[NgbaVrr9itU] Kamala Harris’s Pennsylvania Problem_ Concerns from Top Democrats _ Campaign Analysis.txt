Join the movement. Okay, so we're back with another deep dive. And this time, we're really digging into the 2024 election. Specifically, we're looking at Kamala Harris's chances, and one state that has everyone on edge, Pennsylvania. Yeah, Pennsylvania. It's always a nail-biter, right? Always. And this year, it feels even more crucial. Oh, absolutely. Especially after this Politico article we've got our hands on, let me tell you, it has some Pennsylvania Democrats seriously worried. I bet. Pennsylvania is always a swing state, but it feels like the whole election could hinge on it this time around. Right. Because it's so much at stake, the last thing you want is a campaign that's fumbling the ball. But this article doesn't hold back. It straight up calls out the Harris campaign for being, quote, poorly run in Pennsylvania. Oof. Those are some strong words. They really are. And it's not just one or two disgruntled voices. The article highlights widespread concerns among Pennsylvania Democrats who are using words like worried and anxious about how things are being handled. Which is interesting, right? Because at this level, you expect a well-oiled machine. Yeah. And it's not necessarily in such a vital state. Exactly. So the question is, what's going on? What's got everyone so spooked? Well, one of the big issues the article points to is the campaign's leadership in Pennsylvania. Specifically, there are concerns about Nikki Liu, Harris's campaign manager in the state. Okay. And what's the issue with her? It seems like a lot of the concern is coming from Philadelphia, which as we know is a Democratic stronghold in the state. And some key players there, they're not convinced she has the right kind of experience or connections to really win over the city. Because Philly is make or break for Democrats in Pennsylvania, right? Exactly. We're talking about a city that's a major source of Democratic votes. And not just any votes. A huge chunk of Pennsylvania's minority voters are in Philadelphia. So if the Harris campaign can't win over Philly, they're in big trouble. Exactly. And the article really highlights that. Like there's this quote from Ryan Boyer. He's the head of the city's building trades council. And he straight up says he doesn't think Liu, quote, understands Philadelphia. Ouch. It does. And he's not the only one who feels that way. A lot of Democratic officials and party leaders are worried that Liu doesn't have the right kind of relationships to mobilize those crucial voters. So alienating local leaders in Philadelphia, it's not a good look for the Harris campaign. Not at all. And it really begs the question, if they can't get Philadelphia on board, what are their chances in the rest of the state? Yeah, it does feel like if they can't even get their strategy right in Philly, what hope do they have for the rest of Pennsylvania? It's a valid concern for sure. And the article kind of hints that this might not just be a Philly thing. Really? Yeah, like there's this underlying sense that this lack of engagement with local leaders, it's a pattern for the Harris campaign, not just limited to Philadelphia. So they're stepping on toes all over the state. It seems that way. And it's not like they don't have strong allies in Pennsylvania. Oh, yeah. I mean, you've got Mayor Parker in Philadelphia. Exactly. And the article specifically mentions her. Like some Democrats are wondering why she hasn't been used more effectively as a surrogate for Harris. Yeah, that's a good point. She's super popular, especially in Philly. Right. And she's someone who could really energize voters, get them excited about Harris. So why aren't they utilizing her more? That's the million dollar question. Maybe a lack of understanding about how things work in Pennsylvania. So it's not just about having the right people. It's about knowing how to use them effectively. Exactly. And that actually ties into another major concern the article raises, which is outreach to voters of color. Getting into the nitty gritty now. This is a big one. Huge. And Pennsylvania's demographics are shifting. Latino voters especially. They're a growing force in the state. So are they doing enough to reach out to those voters? That's what the article really calls into question. They highlight this meeting that Harris's campaign had with Latino leaders. I thought it goes bad. Not great, according to the article. One of the attendees, Maria Qui√±ones Sanchez, she used to be on the Philadelphia City Council. Okay. So she knows a thing or two about connecting with voters. Exactly. And she was pretty blunt about the need for more cultural understanding from the campaign. Like she didn't feel heard at all. So it's one thing to show up, but it's another thing to actually listen and understand the needs of that community. Right. And that seems to be the issue here. They need people on the ground who get it, who can connect with those voters authentically. And is the Harris campaign doing that? Well, based on this article, there are definitely some doubts. And without that connection, it's going to be tough to get those votes. You know, it's interesting though, because the article does mention that like financially, the Harris campaign is in a good spot. Oh, yeah. Yeah. They say they're completely flooded with money. They've got the cash. So you'd think with all those resources, they'd be able to turn things around pretty easily. Well, you'd hope so, wouldn't you? Yeah. But here's the thing about campaigns. Yeah. They're not the ones, obviously, but it's not everything. Right. You can't just throw money at a problem and expect it to go away. Exactly. It's like you could give me a million bucks to run a marathon. Uh-oh. Right. But if I haven't trained, if I don't have a plan, that money isn't going to do me much good. You're going to be in trouble. Exactly. Yeah. And I think that's what some people are worried about with the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania. It's not just about having resources. It's about using them effectively. Exactly. Having the right people in place to execute the strategy. Because if you don't have the right team, the right strategy, it doesn't matter how much money you have. Right. You're just going to be spinning your wheels. And the article kind of hints at some deeper issues within the campaign. Deeper issues? Like what? Well, they talk about this woman, Mariel Joy Kornblith Martin. Oh, yeah. She was involved with the campaign, wasn't she? She was. She was actually their Latino coalition manager. Okay. Important role. Crucial role, especially in Pennsylvania. Right. We've talked about how important that voting bloc is. Exactly. So she was brought on to help win over those voters. Okay. She quit after two weeks. Two weeks. That's it. Two weeks. Doesn't exactly inspire confidence, does it? No, not really. What happened? Why'd she leave so suddenly? Well, she didn't leave quietly. That's for sure. The article mentions this memo she wrote. Oh, there's a memo. Juicy. Oh, yeah. She sent it to some of the state party leaders and it's pretty scathing. Okay. So what'd she say? Basically, she accused the campaign of not taking the concerns of Latino voters seriously. Hmm. That seems to be a recurring theme here. It does, doesn't it? She basically said that they were all talk, no action. Like they wanted credit for trying to win over those voters, but they weren't actually giving her the resources to do it. Wow. So a complete disconnect between what they're saying publicly and what's actually happening behind the scenes. Exactly. And that's a problem. One line from the memo that really stuck with me was she said, quote, please give us the tools to win for as we all know, you do not win P.A. without Latinos and you do not win the presidency without P.A. Wow. Mic drop moment right there. Right. It's a pretty damning indictment of the campaign strategy or lack thereof. So what are they doing now to try and fix things? Because it sounds like they've got a lot of work to do. They do. And the clock is ticking. The article does mention that they recently brought in Paulette Aniskoff. Oh, yeah. I know that name. She's worked on some big campaigns, right? Huge campaigns. She was Obama's field director in Pennsylvania back in 2008. Oh, wow. So she knows the state. Knows it inside and out. So bringing her on board, that's a good sign. Yeah. Like they're finally taking this seriously. Right. Like they realize they need someone with serious experience to come in and write the ship. And the article does mention that some Democrats are feeling more hopeful with her on board, but it's still a big challenge. Even Aniskoff, with all her experience, she can't work miracles. Right. It's going to take a lot more than just one person to turn things around. Exactly. They need a real plan and they need to execute it flawlessly and they need to do it fast. Because time is running out. With the election just weeks away, is there enough time for the Harris campaign to salvage their chances in Pennsylvania? Or is this a sign of larger problems within the campaign? It's hard to say for sure. But one thing is clear. It's going to be a battleground state right up until the very end. As it always is. This has been a fascinating look at how local politics, cultural understanding and even money can make or break a campaign. Absolutely. It's a reminder that every vote counts and every voice matters. Thanks for taking this deep dive with us. We'll be back soon to explore another topic shaping the 2024 election.
