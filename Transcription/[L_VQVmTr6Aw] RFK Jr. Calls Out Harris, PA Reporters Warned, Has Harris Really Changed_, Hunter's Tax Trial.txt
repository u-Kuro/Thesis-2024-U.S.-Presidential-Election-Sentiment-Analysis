 I'm Claude McDaniel, and you're watching Streaming News Network. Our top story tonight involves Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has made waves with his latest remarks on Vice President Kamala Harris. In a recent interview, Kennedy criticized Harris, stating she is not a worthy president and defended his endorsement of former President Donald Trump. He told News Nation's Chris Cuomo that Harris lacks the ability to effectively articulate her policies and engage in unscripted debates, key qualities he believes are essential for the presidency. Harris has recently faced criticism for her limited media presence since taking over from President Biden as the Democratic candidate. Her recent interview with CNN's Dana Bash, alongside running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, saw no major missteps, but Kennedy's critique highlights ongoing concerns about her leadership. Kennedy's comments come after his decision last month to suspend his campaign in battleground states and support Trump. He accused the Democratic Party and the media of sidelining his independent campaign, claiming he was barred from the debate stage, which he saw as his only viable path to victory. Kennedy's withdrawal from swing state ballots has sparked legal battles, with the Democratic Party now suing to keep him on ballots in key states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. Speculation continues about Kennedy's potential role in a second Trump administration, though he has avoided discussing specific positions. Instead, he emphasized the importance of a unity party, allowing for continued disagreements on various issues. As we approach the November elections, Kennedy's actions and comments are sure to keep the political landscape tense. Stay tuned for more updates.

A recent photo of Democratic Vice Presidential nominee, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, and his extended family in Nebraska has caused quite a stir on social media. The image, which went viral on Wednesday, shows eight of his relatives wearing Walz's for Trump t-shirts, signaling their support for Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump. Rod Edwards, a family friend of the Walz family, confirmed to the Examiner that the photo is indeed authentic. Edwards explained that a longtime female friend in Omaha, who is featured in the picture, shared the image with him. Edwards then asked if he could disseminate the photo further, and the rest is history. Meanwhile, back on the campaign trail, a local Pennsylvania journalist has raised concerns about the accessibility of Governor Walz to the press during a campaign event in Lancaster County on Wednesday. According to Alyssa Kratz, a reporter for Wup of Fox 43, Walz, who was visiting the Lancaster County Democratic Committee field office with his daughter, Hope, did not take questions from the media. Kratz took to Facebook to express her frustration, writing that while Governor Walz spoke with volunteers for approximately six to seven minutes, the press was not permitted to ask questions or even place microphones near him. When one reporter attempted to shout a question, they were told to not disrupt the program, Fox 43 later confirmed that the media was denied access to the Democratic vice presidential nominee. This development comes amid growing criticism of both Governor Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris for their limited engagement with the press since Harris's presidential campaign launched in July. It took more than six weeks for Harris and Walz to sit down for their first official interview, which aired as a pre-taped segment with CNN's Dana Bash on Thursday. The interview has sparked controversy, with some commentators questioning why Vice President Harris needed Governor Walz by her side for the occasion. To date, Harris has yet to hold a formal press conference, raising further concerns about transparency and accessibility as the campaign heats up. We will continue to follow the story closely as more developments unfold. This is Claude McDaniel, and you're watching Streaming News Network. Now, here's Jones Cink with more news. I'm Jones Cink and welcome to the Streaming News Network. Our top story tonight involves a tense exchange at the White House earlier today, where White House correspondent Peter Ducey questioned press secretary Kareen Jean-Pierre about Vice President Kamala Harris's shifting policy positions. Ducey pressed Jean-Pierre on why Harris has changed several stances since her time as a U.S. senator and during the 2020 presidential race, despite Harris recently stating that her values have not changed. Jean-Pierre defended the vice president by highlighting her achievements over the past three and a half years, particularly on economic issues and the border crisis. She emphasized the administration's successes, despite what she described as a lack of bipartisan cooperation from Republicans. In a follow-up, Ducey asked how much responsibility Harris bears for the rising number of illegal immigrants, proving that 75 percent of recent arrests in Midtown Manhattan involved undocumented individuals. Jean-Pierre reiterated the administration's commitment to removing migrants who pose a national security risk. Appointed by President Biden in March 2021 to address the southern border crisis, Harris has faced criticism for her limited engagement with border issues. Her positions on key issues, such as health care for illegal immigrants, fracking and policing have evolved over time, leading to questions about her consistency as she prepares for the upcoming election season. Whether these changes will impact your political standing remains to be seen. For Streaming News Network, I'm Joan Cink. Welcome back to Streaming News Network, I'm Joan Cink. In our top story, jury selection begins Thursday in Los Angeles for Hunter Biden's federal tax trial. This comes just months after he was convicted on gun charges in a separate case. The federal case accuses Hunter Biden of avoiding at least one point for million dollars in taxes over for years while earning millions from foreign business ventures. He has pleaded not guilty, with his defense expected to argue that his actions were influenced by struggles with substance abuse. U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi, a Trump appointee, has restricted what the jury will hear about the personal tragedies that contributed to Biden's addiction, including the deaths of his brother and mother. The judge also barred expert testimony on addiction that the defense wanted to present. The indictment claims Hunter Biden spent lavishly on strippers and luxury hotels while neglecting his taxes. His defense team sought to limit such details, arguing they amount to character assassination, but the judge has promised to control the introduction of salacious evidence. Prosecutors may also explore Biden's overseas business dealings, which have been the focus of Republican investigations. The defense accuses prosecutors of publicizing these details to influence the jury pool. As jury selection begins, potential jurors will be questioned on their impartiality, including their views on substance abuse, IRS dealings, and whether they believe charges can be politically motivated. This trial follows the collapse of a plea deal in July 2023, leading to separate cases in Delaware and California. Sentencing for Hunter Biden's own conviction in Delaware is set for November 13, where he could face up to 25 years in prison, though a lighter sentence is likely for the first-time offender.
