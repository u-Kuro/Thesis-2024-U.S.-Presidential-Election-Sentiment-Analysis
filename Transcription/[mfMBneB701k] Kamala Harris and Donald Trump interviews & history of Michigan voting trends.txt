 and welcome into the pulse where we focus on all things people power and politics and with the election less than three weeks out now Michigan officials are talking about what's being done to keep elections secure in our state and we're unveiling some new tools for the public to use plus the presidential candidates giving interviews in different spaces like celebrity podcasts we're talking with a social media and pop culture expert about how effective that actually is but we begin with Vice President Harris sitting down on a channel you might not have expected her to Fox News she was interviewed by special report anchor Brett Baer basing tough questions about issues like the border and an ad you're probably seen by the Trump campaign claiming she supports using taxpayer dollars to allow prisoners to have gender reassignment surgery but there was one particular point that stood out when she was asked about President Biden's mental state concerns about if he was able to handle the job led to the push to have him step out of the race you know that here's the exchange between Harris and Brett Baer you told many interviewers that Joe Biden was on his game that ran around circles on his staff when did you first notice that President Biden's mental faculties appeared diminished Joe Biden I have watched in from the Oval Office to the Situation Room and he has the judgment and the experiment and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people Joe Biden is not on ballot I understand Donald Trump Donald Trump and Donald after George Clooney said within a few minutes of talking to President Biden fundraiser that he thought this was not the same Joe Biden that we saw on the debate stage is on the ballot I understand you met with him at least once a week for three and a half years you didn't have any concerns I think the American people have a concern about Donald Trump which is why the people who know him best including leaders of our national security community have all spoken out even people who worked for him in the Oval Office worked with him in the Situation Room and have said he is unfit and dangerous and should never be president of the United States again well you've seen the vice president to a flurry of interviews recently both traditional and non-traditional that's something she's been criticized for not doing enough of having these tough one-on-ones we'll have to see what this latest one does in terms of the polls and the race as well and Harris's appearance on Fox News comes a day after Donald Trump took part in a Fox News town hall in Georgia where he took questions from an audience of only women with topics ranging from immigration and the economy to abortion and all of reproductive rights take a listen I want to talk about IVF I'm the father of IVF so I want to hear this question yeah hi president Trump welcome back to Georgia we are so happy that you're here we're all very blessed to be here with you and thank you for taking questions and so I'm the mother of three small children and I have many friends that have struggled with fertility issues over the years while trying to grow their families and while they're pro-life they're very concerned that the abortion bans will affect their ability to access IVF and other fertility treatments so although abortion does lie with the states what is your stance on that and what would you say to those women so I got a call from Katie Britt a young just a fantastically attractive person from Alabama she's a senator and she called me up like emergency emergency because an Alabama judge had ruled that the IVF clinics were illegal and they have to be closed down a judge ruled and she said friends of mine came up to me and they were oh they were so angry I didn't even know they were going you know she they were it's fertilization I didn't know they were even involved in nobody talks about they don't talk about it but now that they can't do it she said I was attacked in a certain way I was attacked and I said explain IVF very quickly and within about two minutes I understood it I said no no we're totally in favor of IVF our recent poll shows Harris with a double-digit lead with women and Trump with a significant lead with men and research shows that abortion has now passed inflation as the top issue for women under 30 in this election the meantime Trump is continuing his visits to Michigan ahead of the election with a stop in Detroit scheduled for Friday after all those comments about Detroit it'll be an interesting one to watch so the candidates making the interview rounds especially on different platforms like podcasts we wanted to know what you think about their effectiveness here's what people are on Metro Detroit told us it's completely irrelevant oh today's use is very important important because I'd like to see their genuine stance on policies and things that benefit the people as a whole it's not that important to me it's unfortunate that it is seems to be important to a lot of people because our current president is a great president I believe just isn't presentable what's scale I mean it could be well definitely important I just watched a couple and thought they were very good and thoughtful and informative they are celebrities aren't they yeah you gotta put them on there you can see them grill them answer but do you think it's different on a celebrities podcast anything goes nowadays man let's have fun with it you know the commercials she said she's worn out so many people who she's 80 she said so many people were half her age say they're worn out too but you know it's an important question we actually asked the question on our website Fox to Detroit comm to see what people thought most of those who responded say candidates appearing on these celebrity podcasts it doesn't really affect who they're voting for 78% not a scientific poll but an interesting conversation that if you'd like to join you can use that QR code at the bottom of your screen stick your phone and go right up to it and boom there it is and it'll pop up on your phone and by the way if you see me out and about with my cell phone you want to talk to us about anything on your mind when it comes to politics stop and say hi love to be able to talk to you well one of the biggest contest here at home is the Michigan Senate race Democrat Alyssa Slocum a Republican Mike Rogers obviously both going head-to-head they're vying to fill that seat vacated by longtime senator Debbie Stabenow they had two debates now and while Senate races can often mirror results of presidential races and polling wise it seems that way right now senator Gary Peters says there are some differences here he talked to the pulse tonight well we see here in Michigan as we do around the country Senate races and presidential races tend to be very closely linked but they're not totally linked they are separate and the reason for that is that they're they are indeed separate races and so if you look at the Senate race it's a candidate versus candidate race people are going to look at Alyssa Slocum and her Republican opponent and make a decision based on that difference certainly Alyssa Slocum is someone who's represented her district here in Michigan with distinction and honor and has worked very hard and she's running against a Republican opponent who has been living in Florida for many years and just decided to come to Michigan to run for office and I think people will support Alyssa understand that she cares deeply about Michigan and I'm confident she will win on her own regardless of what happens at the presidential level we should mention we talked to mr. Rogers camp about that allegation that he's just not living in Michigan and they pointed out to me that he does have a house in White Lake right now he's living with his brother as some some issues with the infrastructure of the house are being fixed up but that is the address and he says he is running from out here in Oakland County a recent poll from AARP has locked in with a three-point lead over Rogers and shows she's favored by women while men prefer Rogers kind of like the Trump thing we told you about and the Harris thing both candidates are continuing to visit communities and meet voters this week Slocum was in Macomb County and Rogers visited Howell so do you trust this election will actually be secure any of you who answered no as you're sitting on your sofa this next one is aimed at you today it wasn't a candidate at a town hall in Michigan but the issue of election security that took center stage state election officials led the meeting telling the audience at the Sterling Heights Community Center that there are several measures in place to protect elections including an upgraded file system and voting technology that's improved another tool better communication between local state and federal government workers officials say while voting fraud is rare there are precautions to make sure it's curbed I sort of um like an election fraud to the crime of bank robbery and why do I do that? because I'm not going to tell you that nobody ever tries to rob a bank I'm just going to say it's very difficult to do and you almost certainly are going to get caught now recent poll shows 77% of voters in Michigan have confidence in the elections and by the way today's discussion was moderated by none other than our own Charlie Langton and I'm sure it was a very lively discussion as he always has such a talent at doing that another tool unveiled today is this the Michigan voting dashboard it's a database with ballot returns and voter registration numbers across the state and as you can see over here it kind of gives you an exact count there Benson says the dashboard will be updated every day with the data coming in from local clerks who are the first officials by the way to receive ballots from voters it is trusted reliable and accurate with this information anyone can see how their own community has voted and how it is voting in real time we've all seen the ways that data taken out of context can be used to distort the truth that will escalate in the weeks ahead now the dashboard can also track information on absentee ballots according to the state more than 2.1 million registered voters in Michigan have requested an absentee ballot and so far more than 670,000 of those have been completed and sent back in it's a slightly lower return rate than in 2020 believe it or not for more information on how you can track your absentee ballot head to our website Fox to Detroit.com and by the way this is really important I want you to hear me out here if you have any questions about this election process and you want me to ask officials ask away email me directly at RUPP.Raj at Fox.com this show isn't just about your opinions when you do the pulse check but your concerns and your questions and if you have any of those we'd like to just basically take those questions and concerns turn around get the answers and come back on the pulse on another night and answer your questions on TV well the pulse is just getting started it isn't all about policy but yeah it's about personality too Donald Trump is doing this one better in the world of entertainment than Kamala Harris to get your void what is he doing better a social media and pop culture expert on how the presidential candidates have to do a lot more than show up on TV and talk policy you're watching the pulse on Fox 2 all right welcome back to the policy election is now 20 days away or so both candidates hitting the pavement hard working to spread their messages that includes using some different kinds of formats like podcasts joining us now on the pulse social media expert Ethan Lloyd it's good to see you thanks for joining us today thank you for having me you know we always depend on you to talk about what these candidates are doing to lure voters in Kamala Harris Donald Trump both doing that you'll see right here some examples of that this is again the podcast aspect of it what do we see miss Harris doing right here yes and to make a clear distinction YouTube is still social media people confuse that it's not because it's not so direct but there is a comment section there's a way to share you can communicate on that platform so the podcasts that you see on YouTube those are social media clips so we're seeing something very different that we've never seen before on social media which is presidential candidates making it their job to go on podcast because this is a great way to show your personality and policy at the same time in a long format form instead of a short format form so what we just saw on the screen were different appearances that Kamala Harris has done and she has done a great job of showing her personality she has gone on shows with NBA athletes she's going on shows with comedians she's even been on the shade room which you wouldn't necessarily expect from a presidential candidate but we are in a very different time now we're in a different political landscape and we're in a different social media landscape you can't just depend on doing print and broadcasts and call it a day you have to be on social and you got to find those those influencers to do it and that's what we see here is doing we see Trump doing a bunch of the same what do we see him doing here yeah no this is very interesting we just saw him on the podcast with Dave Ramsey now he's on one with dr. Phil he was even on flagrant with Andrew Schulz this is really interesting he is going on podcast talking about policy you know it's very strategic he aligns his messaging with the audience that he's talking to so Dave Ramsey is big on personal finance and talking about the economy he went on there and talked about his economic plan that is a very strong social media strategy to in a long format way talk about what it is that you're gonna get done to the people that want to hear it and what's really cool about all these different podcasts that we're seeing here is that they're you know independent you know these aren't right leaning or left leaning they're in the middle and that is good because that allows you to reach independent voters well that's important and you've been very unbiased when you've been talking about both these candidates you've talked about the good things that former president Trump has done you you said this repeatedly that he does policy points on social media yeah that's gonna benefit him how I think it's gonna benefit him because there's no question of what he's going to do if I vote for him at least I have an understanding of what it means to check off his his name in the ballot you know and and that's helpful I think we're seeing a new form of social media where people are using it as a tool of research now whether that's the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do we can debate all day but that's what's happening and he is leveraging that and showing his policy on these platforms and some of the other things that you've observed you say you know they're both doing these podcasts I think a lot of times people accuse the Harris camp of doing soft interviews and they talk about that all the time but if you if to be fair to both camps here Trump is doing a lot of soft interviews too yeah and if you're doing a podcast or a lifestyle show or a sports show you're probably not getting a 60-minute style question coming your way yeah and it's not always a hardball being thrown at you you know we talked about that these podcasts are run by comedians NBA players things like that entertainers we want it to be entertaining you know we want to see them cook you know in the kitchen when it's hot but we also want to see how they are when they're pleasant we want to know you know what kind of father or mother they are we want to know what kind of parent they are what kind of person they are what kind of citizen there are we have to look at all aspects of a candidate not just when they're under pressure but when they're you know relaxed that's very important and so when you get to know somebody not just for their policies even though Trump is using so much of this for his policies Kamala Harris can actually say hey this is why I am get to know me as a human being maybe something that makes you laugh something about your family do you think in your mind does that help drive up engagement even more when people see those kinds of moments yeah any emotion that you invoke in social media content is going to make people react in the way that people react as they press a button they either press the comment button the share button the like button whatever that button is the algorithm likes it and you're looking at some other things over here talk about what we're seeing here in terms of the credits so this is what they both need to work on I think this is very low this is a platform called pod chaser and it's telling us how many appearances they have had Harris has had 37 podcast appearances and Trump has had 43 podcast appearances that sounds like a lot but honestly for a presidential candidate and this kind of political climate I think they need to do more how many podcasts are out there would you say in general you have in terms of the popular ones yeah okay these two would want to come on oh there are thousands there are thousands because everybody and their mother has a podcast they're from being honest with you all you need is a microphone a couple lights and a camera and you got yourself a podcast and talk about the kinds of numbers you're looking at you know you mentioned Kamala Harris doing 30 some Donald Trump doing 40 some when you add these all up are you how many millions of people are you oh my goodness these are getting two to three million views a pop and we're talking about something that is an hour long to two hours long that is a lot you just had an hour long conversation with two million people and if you know you've done 43 of them do that multiplication I can't do it in my head not my strong point but this is an interesting conversation one that will continue is there anything we'll do that will finalize this interview with the two things that you always do at the end of your interviews which is what can Kamala Harris do better what can Donald Trump do better outside of just showing up yeah in general in terms of the messaging that they're going oh yes I would like to see both of these candidates not just talking to independent podcast but also see them under fire a little bit I want to see Kamala Harris go on the Candace Owens podcast I want to see Donald Trump go on the Stephen A. Smith podcast I want to see them in a situation where for an hour they are under fire and they are hearing what the opposition thinks this is where you meet people in the middle this is where you find out how people do under pressure and that's something that you want to find out in a political leader Ethan Lloyd it's good to see you thanks for joining us you know this is not a podcast but this is a show that many of you watch and has gained a lot of steam so we invite both and we by the way I mean that we literally email the Trump and Harris camp every single week we're asking them to come on the show talk to us so that they can talk to you we thank you for talking to us today thank you for having me good stuff Ethan well we're giving a little history lesson about the presidential race in Michigan next on the pulse know which two metro Detroit counties are actually purple you've got three minutes to make your guess we'll see after the break hey we are so glad so many of you make this a part of your routine here welcome back to the pulse looking at all things people power and politics from the deed to DC and now we're gonna focus right now on all of us the people of Metro Detroit specifically how we voted over the years it's no secret no two counties in our area are alike this is such a critical swing state and we have a really cool visual representation of that take a look this is where each county leans since the 2000 presidential election you probably won't be surprised to know that Wayne Washtenaw and Oakland overwhelmingly voted Democrats since that race while Livingston, Lapeer, and Lenaway and St. Clair counties have voted Republican red we've noticed that but then there are two counties which might just surprise you McComb and Monroe since the 2000 election they've been so split they're actually considered purple counties in fact it's actually a 50-50 split in those counties going Democrat and Republican since the vote and what's even more interesting they voted the exact same way since the year 2000 and we have that for you here follow me here for a moment former president Trump carried McComb and Monroe in both 2016 and also in 2020 but before that they were blue with Barack Obama getting the W George W Bush took the counties back in 2004 but that was the only time losing to Al Gore and McComb and Monroe in the 2000 race now comparing the presidential to the gubernatorial races and I just geek out on this stuff because I find it so interesting I hope you do too during that time frame Monroe County has been overwhelmingly red but McComb is more purple and that's where things get really interesting check this out going back to the 2002 gubernatorial race McComb County has voted the opposite of what it did in the presidential race opposite stay with me here governor Whitmer won the county both times after Trump won it and that pattern actually holds throughout this entire time period going all the way back to when Dick posthumous won McComb County two years after Gore won it in the presidential race and so it's just fascinating to see the split there but the governor's race is two years from now so let's focus back on the presidential race for a second I know you need to catch your breath after this presidential race before you deal with another consequential election we asked you Monday who you thought would win Michigan if the election were held that day Vice President Harris or former President Trump and we heard a lot from you that day more than we were able to actually share so here now a bonus pulse check I think it's just too close to call Donald Trump why because when he was in the election last time he was on everything that was right and positive I think it's gonna be real close real real close gonna be a real close race I don't know I would say it's really close to call a little too close to call right now and then why do you think that because there's so many people and everyone has their way that they see the different candidates right so for example when it comes to Trump there's so many things that he already done he's already been a president so they're able to see a lot more of what he's done in the past and use that to help them with this voting as well as well this is the first woman to be president possibly and being able to get that in so many different thoughts on what can happen what has happened what it shouldn't happen that's why I would say it's it's close to call now you saw earlier we caught up with senator Peters this afternoon we also wanted to talk to him about the state of the presidential race he agreed that it's tight it's close but also says that's par for the course with a swing state like Michigan there's no question now this race is very tight and it's exactly what we expected you know Michigan is a national battleground state and by definition if you're a battleground state it's going to be a very close race it's going to go right down to the wire I'm not surprised by where the numbers are right now that is something we would expect but it also means we all have to be very focused on making sure that we're getting every voter to the poll and it's important for candidates to come in and make their case as often as they can you know I've gotten to know Kamala Harris very well over the year she was my seatmate in the Senate I know she cares deeply about Michigan she understands issues in our state and I'm really pleased the fact that she's making so many visits to see us and we'll see if both these candidates talk to the pulse we put out the call again today thanks for joining us here on the pulse stay tuned for battleground with SC cup I'm Ruparaj have a great night you
