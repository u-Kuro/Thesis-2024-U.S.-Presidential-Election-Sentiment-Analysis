 Dark Soul on the I am says a lot of guests on the show keep bringing up how there's some sort of issue legitimacy or otherwise with Harris not winning a primary but no one seems to ever clarify what this even means or why it actually matters other than verily vague aesthetic issues. I think the idea is is this I don't think it's a legitimacy issue. I mean the fact is is that had Biden been nominated which he was going to be and then resigned it would have gone to Harris and it would have been no controversy. I think the issue is is that without having been elected by it directly within primaries Congress people senators who will bring pressure to bear or have their own sort of constituencies that they have to address do not have a watershed to say that they can't go against the president because there's no clear indication that there was electoral support for that person. That's I you know what I think people are addressing when they say or at least what these guys are saying is that getting votes is in some manner at the very least a indication to other political players as to where the margin where the power lies and it's not it's not you know this is not a surgical thing right this is all subjective but it is a big subjective measure and I think in the absence of that you know what percentage of Democratic voters let's say like for instance you know just like you can look people are going to look at what you know senators are going to look and say like oh I got I won 60 percent of the vote Harris only won 51 percent of the vote in my state this is all just I'm just you know throwing out numbers to walk you through this and they're going to say like I trust my popularity more than hers and therefore if I my inclination is to do X and hers is to do Y I may be more interested in doing X than Y. I know that I got 75 percent of the Democratic primary vote I don't know how many Democrats are with her if only 51 percent I've got the strength here that I think is is what Stoller was referring to in this instance I think from the perspective of like a Reid Hoffman or something the circumstances where she didn't have to go through a primary and all of a sudden she's the candidate and you just get to go directly to her is you know present some opportunities it presents some opportunities but also I mean depending on who that person is right who Harris is it presents some problems because going through that primary process is where you build up like all right you know I'm getting chits and these I'm gonna call you know these chits in so it's difficult it's it's difficult it's difficult to assess so and that's I guess that's the point one president who gets into office this way might take a tact early on to establish that like look I've got the political power I know you think I may not a different president may handle it differently and create openings it just it it it presents the opportunity for other political power to exert itself without necessarily having the fear of the electorate in the same way so we'll see Cole from Michigan do political mandates come from primaries within political parties I think they do I think they do for to a significant extent you know there's a story we didn't get too deep into it from Vox about how so many of these antitrust people got into the Biden administration and part of that story was like you know what happened during the primaries you know with even with Clinton you know Warren in many respects was a figure who in 2016 delivered or was seen to have delivered many of the Sanders voters to Clinton obviously you know I mean there were other problems with Clinton's running but she had the binder ready of people who were going to be you know in these positions for Clinton and then Clinton didn't make it into office but Warren also had the opportunity to do that with Biden and I would say like these changes aren't happening because of any election outcome but more broader economic trends and say running out of runway for neoliberalism and austerity and like I don't think they'd learned a lesson from 2016 or you know I don't know if there's a lesson to be learned as much as it is like you know you need you go to the power that you need at any given point and post financial crisis yes and more often than not there's more than one option as to where you're going to find that power it's just a question of like what's it going to cost me how invested am I in what I have to give up hey folks don't forget to hit the subscribe button and check out our daily show we do it every day at 12 p.m eastern for about two and a half hours we even take phone calls you should check that out
