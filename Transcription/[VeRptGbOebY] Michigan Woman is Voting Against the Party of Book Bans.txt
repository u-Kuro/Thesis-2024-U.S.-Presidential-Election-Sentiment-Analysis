 Let's start with what's already happened in our schools. Book banning, really? Is this Nazi Germany? We're banning books. We're deciding whether our kids are going to be able to express themselves, or who they might believe they are at a very young age, or where they may know they are for sure by the time they're teens. I can't imagine, I'm gonna tell you that when I was 18 years old and I was a senior in high school, I wasn't allowed to take the high level calculus math class because I was a woman and I would never have a job. That was what the teachers told me. This has happened in my lifetime. I'm 61 years old for crying out loud. I don't think the young people realize how fragile all of these rights for all of us equally, that we all have an equal chance in this country. I don't think they realize how fragile and short lived that really is.
