 I'm going to say in by Friday. My voting dog right there is 19. Sounds like four pages on my ballot. Front and back, though, two front and back. I've got two. I have to go around and say anger. Do you need any information on the profit decisions around 139? Because we don't do any voiceovers. So basically, I keep on you to kind of understand what your target is. We're welcome. Thank you for voting. Federally, that right is not protected, right? And so to keep this from continuing to take resources, take time to try to protect women and protect families, we need to enshrine this in the Constitution here. Otherwise it will be every two years we're voting to keep basic health care for women and for families, women that are dying from these abortion bans for not getting care for miscarriage. That's factual. So you can't separate them. It's no longer about trying to convince people, oh, like, morally this is how you should feel about it. Factually these bans are killing women. The initiative is something that gives back to women their rights to their own bodies. I'll be voting against the abortion thing just because, you know, I'm pro-life. I believe in the sanctity of life. I believe in exceptions, much like President Trump, but I do think that we need to protect life whenever we can. Proposition 139, the Arizonans for Abortion Access. I think that the polls show that it's much more complicated, that it's a more divisive issue within each party. And so it will be for Arizonans part of their political calculation, but it is not going to be the thing that decides whether Democrats or Republicans win the state of Arizona.
