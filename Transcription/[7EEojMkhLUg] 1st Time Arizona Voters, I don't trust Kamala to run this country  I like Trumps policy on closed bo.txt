 I don't trust Kamala to run this country. We spoke to new Trump supporters at Arizona State. I like his policy on closed borders and I don't like illegal immigration. He talks like I talk with my friends. Aiden Garth is a regular Joe Rogan listener and voted early for Trump. If people sit down and actually watch the full long term interview, I think they'll see more kind of who Trump is, kind of not the evil guy that everyone makes him out to be.
