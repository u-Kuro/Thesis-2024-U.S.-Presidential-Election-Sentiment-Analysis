 What's going on everyone? Welcome back to the show. So I want to take a look at the presidential race. We're going to take a look at Georgia again. I want to look at the counties because what we're looking at in Georgia with early voting, this could be what we see on election day when it comes to the nation. Okay, now I'm saying it could be it might not happen, but we're seeing record breaking numbers. And when we take a look at the counties, you're going to see what I'm talking about. So that's what we're going to focus on in this video. But first off, you guys can do me a favor. Please like the video.

And so these are official numbers. And this is early voting, you have 1,220,701 ballots cast. And what I want to do is I want to show you the counties this year compared to four years ago. And so we're going to take a look at what counties my favorite Harris over Trump. So let me show you what I'm talking about. So we're looking at the first county here, Fulton County, Fulton County, we have 141,539 votes. And when we look at Fulton County back in 2020, you see that Biden won by 73%, and a total of 380,212 votes. So when we go back to early voting, you see already have 141,000. And then when we look, and I'll be flipping back screen to screen, when we go back to 2020, we're looking at 380,000. And so just in the last few days of voting, they're already over 30%. When it comes to if we're looking at this top line number of 380,000. So you see they're probably going to outpace this number here. So we're going to see more votes. Now, let's go back. I want to take a look at the next county. So the next county would be Cobb County. So when we're looking at Cobb County, we have 89,897 votes that have been cast so far this year. Now looking at 2020, the election in 2020, 56% voted for Biden. And we had 221,000 votes. So let's look at the next county, Gwinnett County. So Gwinnett County, 86,561 votes have been cast. If we go back to 2020, we're looking at Biden winning this county as well, 58%, 241,994. We look at the next county to Cobb, 84,746. And if we go back to 2020, we see that Biden won that county by 83%, 308,162 votes. Now, if we go to the next county foresight, now I might say some of these counties a little bit wrong. I don't live in Georgia, so I'm just going off what I think, how I think it would be pronounced. However, we have 36,836 votes. And if we go back to 2020, we see that Trump won that county 66%, total votes 85,123. Now, if we go to the next county, that's Cherokee and that's 33,788 ballots cast. And if we go back to 2020, Trump won this county 69% and total votes 99,585. So the next county would be Henry and that's currently 32,171 votes. Now, if we go back to 2020, Biden won this county by 60%, so 73,433. So looking at Chatham, it says 38,000, but I believe it's 28,000, so it'll be 28,613. I'll have to check that. But just looking at the illustration, the Henry is 32,000 and Clayton is 27,000, so it would be in between those numbers. And so if we go back to 2020, the important part here is the percentage. Biden won by 59%, his total votes 78,247. Now, looking at the current numbers in Clayton County, 27,941. And if we go back to 2020, we see that Biden won that county by 85%, totaling 95,466. Now, looking at Hall County, 25,892, those are the current numbers. If we go back to 2020, we see that Trump won that county by 71%, total votes 64,183. Now, looking at Houston County, 22,517 current votes. If we go back to 2020, we see that Trump won that county by 56%, total number there, 41,540. Now, looking at Coweta County, I think it's Coweta County, 21,817 votes. Now, looking at the next county, Coweta County, I think it's pronounced Coweta County, 21,817 votes. And if we go back to 2020, we see that Trump won by 67%, with a total number of 51,501 votes. Now, we're looking at Fayette County, 19,774 current votes. If we go back to 2020, we see that Trump won that county by 53%, and total votes 37,956. If we take a look at Columbia County, 19,879 votes currently. If we go back to 2020, we see that Trump won that county by 62%, total votes 50,013. Now, looking at the next county, Muskogee, we have 18,888 votes. And we see back in 2020, Biden won that county by 61%, total votes 49,446. And looking at the last county here, we have 18,853 current votes. And we see back in 2020, Biden won Douglas County by 62%, total votes 42,814. Okay, so now that's what everything looks like when we pull up the counties. Now, I didn't show every county, I just showed like the top 15, but you guys get the point. And let me show you this, we'll break it down by party affiliation. So, we know right now that Fulton County, it leans for Democrats. Okay, now look at the number of votes. This is what's important. The number of votes that have been cast already, and we already know that in Georgia, they're breaking records. So, this record could be broken when we look at the overall, on November 5th, when we look at everything, we could see record breaking numbers in all of these counties. So, I want to see what counties are favoring Democrats compared to the counties that are favoring Republicans. And right now we know Fulton County favors Democrats. When we look at Cobb County, Cobb County favors Democrats, Gwinnett County favors Democrats, DeKalb County favors Democrats, the top four here, the top four counties favor Democrats, and they have huge populations. And so looking at foresight that favors Republicans, also a Cherokee favors Republicans. And then we have Henry favoring Democrats, a Chatham favoring Democrats, Clayton favoring Democrats, Hall favoring Republicans, Houston favoring Republicans, Coeda favoring Republicans, Fayette favoring Republicans, Columbia favoring Republicans, Muskogee favoring Democrats, and Douglas favoring Democrats. And so just looking at this, and we can count up the counties out of the top 15, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. So we have nine, when it comes to Democrats, we have nine counties that are favoring the Democrats. And when it comes to Republicans, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So we have seven counties that are favoring Republicans currently. Okay, so total, we have 16 counties. I just showed the counties that were on the list. Okay, so the first list, I can scroll down and we can go down to some of the other counties, but I wanted to take like the top counties that are being listed. And so you can see the early voting in Georgia, it looks like Harris has, she's favored right now because you have these large counties that are coming out to vote at a much higher pace than some of the other counties. Now, just because Fulton County or Gwinnett or some of these larger counties that tend to vote for Democrats, just because they have larger numbers doesn't mean that they're going to come out at larger rates, you could have smaller counties outpace some of these larger counties in early voting, we're seeing a surge in some of these larger counties. And that's probably going to help Harris. Okay, I want to show you the electoral map. And you guys know I like to end with this just to show you how important Georgia really is. Now looking at the electoral map, and I just filled in the states, this is how we think it will look. And this is based on the 538 polling average. So when we're looking at our map, the only thing I didn't fill in is Georgia filled in everything else. Let's say Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania can go either way. Right now it's a toss up. But let's just say that it goes for Trump. If it goes for Trump, and Trump wins North Carolina, Trump wins Arizona, and Harris wins Nevada, Wisconsin, and Michigan, then we're going to be looking at a scenario that looks just like this. Democrats have 257, Republicans have 265, and you need 270 to win. And so now everybody's looking at Georgia to figure out what's going to happen in Georgia. Now if Georgia obviously goes for Harris, then Harris will win with 273 votes. However, if Georgia goes for Trump, then Trump will have 281 votes over the 270, and he would win. So that is what it's all about. That's what we're looking at. Now this is very likely. We could see something like this. Now as I stated, Pennsylvania is a toss up right now. And if you look at 538, their polling average, Harris has a slight advantage. So let's just say she's able to win Pennsylvania. If she wins Pennsylvania, then Georgia's not going to matter because she'll go over the 270. She'll have 276. So that's something else that we're looking at. Now if Trump is able to pull out Pennsylvania, now Georgia matters. Now he has to win Georgia in order to win, and Harris would have to win Georgia in order to win the presidency. So I just wanted to give you an update when it comes to the presidential race and mainly looking at Georgia. And will Georgia be the model for the rest of the states on election day? We don't know. We'll have to find out. But we have some good indicators right now that are that are leaning for Harris when it comes to the numbers that we're seeing come in Georgia.
