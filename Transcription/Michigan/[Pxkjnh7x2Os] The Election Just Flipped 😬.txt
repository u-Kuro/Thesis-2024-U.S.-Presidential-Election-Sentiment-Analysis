 We are just one month out from the 2024 election, and we have some significant moves in the betting markets. So for most of the summer, the race looked like this with Harris having the slight advantage in Wisconsin and Michigan, Trump ahead in Georgia, North Carolina, and Nevada and PA being right on the edge. But all of a sudden, the betting markets moved Wisconsin and Michigan to toss up and Pennsylvania into slight Trump edge. Taking a look at the polling, the gap is beginning to close across the board, but technically Harris still has a slight lead in these states. So what I think is going on here is the betting markets are trying to factor in polling errors. For example, in 2016, Trump was down 3% in Pennsylvania, and he ended up winning the state.
