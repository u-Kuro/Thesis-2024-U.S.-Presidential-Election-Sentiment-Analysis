 Election Day is getting closer here in the United States and it appears that Kamala Harris's momentum is slowing down, fading away even. In states like Arizona, I'm standing in Holbrook right now, things are moving definitely in Trump's way, but in a surprise to many, he is also moving ahead in the other swing states. Michigan, he's ahead. Pennsylvania, he's ahead. These are small margins for Donald Trump to be a head buy, but they are big enough that he would likely win. He won Michigan and Pennsylvania against Hillary Clinton in 2016 despite being far behind. If Trump wins Pennsylvania and Michigan, it's game over for Kamala Harris. She was here in Arizona last week trying to rescue their efforts in this state. It had looked very close, but polls moving away from her and towards Donald Trump, which is fascinating because this is a state that's going to elect a Democrat to their vacant Senate position and also vote to enshrine abortion rights in their Constitution, although with limits, a move that is annoying people on the extremes of both sides on that issue. So places like Arizona are a mixed bag and it's going to be much the same when it comes to Michigan and Pennsylvania. If Trump wins, it will be due to the economy. People just don't feel like Bidenomics is working for them at this point and Kamala Harris has been a big part of that. So when Trump says he's going to look out for workers, he's going to bring in tariffs, that may not please the economic club, but it's pleasing voters.
