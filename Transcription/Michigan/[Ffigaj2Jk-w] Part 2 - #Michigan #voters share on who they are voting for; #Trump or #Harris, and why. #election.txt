 Who are you going to vote for for president? You won't be Trump. Is that how you look at it? Not who you're voting for, but who you're voting against? No, I just know that's not a good choice. What do you look at, what do you think about when you're deciding who to vote for? The person that represents our United States more than anything. Do you think that's Kamala Harris then? Yes, I do. Yes, I do. I like her perspective on taking care of everyone in the United States and everything. So yes, I look at all of that. And what is it about Trump? I mean, your reaction was so visceral. What is it about Trump that just says no? He's an idiot. That's all I could tell you. He is an idiot.
