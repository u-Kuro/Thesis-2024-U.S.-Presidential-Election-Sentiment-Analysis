 I think Harris is going to take it again. Her chances are very good. You know why? Because love is on the ballot this year. We choose love and we choose joy. We are not going back. What I'm hoping for is that the women really bring it to the table. I really, I mean, they've, they've really, you know, surprised me at least in 2022. And I surprised, they surprised a lot of people. And I'm really hoping that that's really what surprises and blows all these, you know, poles out of the water. I think her chances are better in 2024. We're getting out to vote. We're knocking on doors. We're making phone calls. Get out and vote. Do not stay at home. This is a big election. This is for our democracy, women's rights. I hope she wins. I'm definitely nervous, yes. But I'm going in to vote and I'm hoping all my friends and family vote. Absentee ballot. I already voted. In person on election day. One, it works with my schedule being a night shifter, but also I think it's, you know, kind of symbolic. But anyway, people can get out and vote, just do it. I go in person. I vote early so that I can get others to come out and vote. I'm going to be voting this weekend actually. And I'll be voting absentee.
