 One of our leading Republicans in Michigan has something important for the American people to hear. I have to say that everyone should make it emphatic and vote Democratic for President. Yes, yes, is that what you just did? That's what I just did. I'm a registered Republican living in Michigan. This year for the first time I'm voting for a Democrat for what they stand for, which is closer to what I stand for. Which is just basic goodness, really. Right. Equality for everybody. How many years have you been a Republican? Well, probably from the time I was 21, so right that since I started voting. I think that Donald Trump would be a total disaster for our nation, and I cannot vote for him. And what would you encourage other Republicans to think about when they're voting? I would encourage them to think about what Donald Trump stands for and what Kamala stands for, and to really think about what those stances would mean for the American people. So what's at stake for women if Donald Trump is our president? I think it's bad news for women. What about gay rights and rights for people like your daughter who's a lesbian? He probably would change the rights that exist now for gay people. I believe that a very normal Republican would generally not support Trump or anybody like him. Harris Waltz. Harris Waltz. Harris Waltz. Harris Waltz. Good work, Mom. Thank you. You want the camera out of your face, huh? Yes.
