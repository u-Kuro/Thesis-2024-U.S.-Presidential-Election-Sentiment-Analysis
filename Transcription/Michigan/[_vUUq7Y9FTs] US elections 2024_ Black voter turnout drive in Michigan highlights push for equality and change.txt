 Dance and music at this Renaissance school in Detroit. But there's a much more serious message to the celebration. A push to convince black American voters to go to the polls in the crucial battleground state of Michigan. There's two main voting blocs in America who voted dependently, who vote consistently. That's black women and the second one is black men. I'm sure they're going to vote overwhelmingly in their own interests. Their interests are equality, education and health care among other issues. Data shows black communities in Michigan have struggled with a legacy of discrimination, segregation, poverty and in many cases high unemployment rates. This wall that you can see here is called the Birdwood Wall. It was built back in the 1940s, meant to separate a white neighborhood from a black one that was located right here. Around 80% of the African Americans here in Michigan vote for the Democratic Party. And many of them fear that if Donald Trump wins this election, the racism and discrimination they face will get worse. Kelly T. Shaq says he grew up right next to this wall. He says the color of his kin continues to define what he can and cannot do. But even though most African Americans will vote for Kamala Harris, latest polls show she's lagging behind among black men, especially in the country's poorest areas. Sam Riddle says the Democratic Party has made mistakes when appealing to black voters. The turnout that the Democratic Party needs to give it an insurance, political insurance policy against Trump, I don't believe is in places we speak right now. I fear that because of the lack of understanding of the class divide in black America, that the Harris campaign may have missed the vote. One thing is certain, the African American vote will play a crucial role in the swing state of Michigan, in an election where every vote counts. Teresa Waugh, Al Jazeera, Detroit, Michigan.
