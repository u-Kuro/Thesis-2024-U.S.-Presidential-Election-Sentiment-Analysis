 Why should a voter in Michigan who's lost multiple family members in Israel's genocidal attack on Gaza and attack using US weapons, why should they vote for a candidate who says, I'm not going to budge on this issue. I'm going to continue the Biden policy. I'm going to continue arms sales. Why should they vote for Kamala Harris on November the 5th? How do you persuade someone in that situation to vote for Kamala Harris?
