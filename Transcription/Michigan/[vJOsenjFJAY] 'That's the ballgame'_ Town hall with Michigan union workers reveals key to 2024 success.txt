 Today we are coming to you live from the crucial swing state of Michigan where yesterday we spoke with union workers a key voting block in this state about What they care about and just as importantly what they're just not paying all that much attention to So again, my name is Connor yeah, but February 6 January 6 So I remember that day I know he was the standing president I Am NOT familiar with the charges that are being brought against him for that I don't I'm not following that charge for the others multiple court cases going on. I'm just not familiar with it And and do you think you I mean that doesn't sound like it's gonna be a factor and deciding who to vote for If you're watching this show tonight odds are you watch a lot of news we thank you for it Odds are you know quite a bit about January 6th and the litany of criminal and civil cases brought against Donald Trump? But this election is likely to come down to just a few thousand voters for whom keeping up with political news is not a priority So how do you reach this vanishingly small group of voters who don't fit into traditional political models who don't conform to typical political profiles who are frustratingly elusive and who might end up determining this entire election Joining me now is Mallory McMorrow Democratic Majority Whip of the Michigan State Senate and John Favreau Former Obama head speechwriter and co-host of the indispensable wildly popular podcast Pods Save America. Thank you both for joining me tonight Mallory let me start with you first I came away from this meeting with these union workers thinking man what a challenge it is for either campaign But especially a campaign that has spent so much capital as an administration the Harris-Walls campaign formally button campaign trying to get to these union voters and Here you have a group of key undecideds Who are just they're not following the news and in the way that you know a lot of voters follow the news They are getting their information from sort of circles outside of traditional media. They're not particularly engaged in policy and yet They might determine the election I wonder what you can tell me from your sort of first-hand understanding of this electorate the challenge that the Harris team in particular has in getting to these people and convincing them to go pull the lever for Kamala Harris So I think what you've heard in the interviews is people are working hard. They're concerned about the economy They're concerned about buying a home and they're concerned about keeping a good union job And to me that points to the importance of something I've been advocating for for the past couple of years is state legislatures It's not just the bench It's the foundation because we are the ones who are going door to door We are the ones that have candidates in the community We will be out Knocking on thousands of doors for people who may not watch the news as frequently as you and I do To talk about the fact that Michigan Democrats became the first state in 60 years to repeal right to work You saw President Biden on the line with so many of us on the line during the picket To say this is a team and we support Kamala Harris and here's why John it brought to the floor You know when you talk about political strategy like with there obviously a lot of money it gets dumped into the ad wars You know there's there's a lot of money spent on events and rallies But it felt to me like in these conversations with these undecided union voters That the convincing would have to be done at the grassroots level that it would have to come Naturally from the community and the trusted voices that these guys listen to who aren't necessarily campaign surrogates And I wonder you know in your experience going out into the world and talking to young voters like What are the critical like delivery systems by which you convince people that the election matters? And that one candidate in particular is the one that they should be voting for First of all I'm so glad that you are doing this and that you talk to folks and I hope that everyone watching Tunes in because that will decide the election what those people end up doing is going to decide the election and most people Most voters in the country aren't like us. They aren't political junkies. They're not watching MSNBC They're not listening to pod save America, but they vote and I think what the Harris walls campaign is doing And they've set up a fantastic organization the Biden campaign did as well in the states in the communities And I think what they've realized is you know television ads are fine events are great, but at the end It's gonna come down to door-to-door grassroots Organizing door knocking and you're gonna be more likely to You know trust someone who you know who's either a colleague or a friend or a family member And you know I think for a lot of these voters the contrast is gonna come down to Who's gonna fight for them when it comes to the economy and so you know Kamala Harris is giving a speech in Pittsburgh tomorrow She's gonna lay out her economic vision And I would expect her to also contrast that vision with Donald Trump because I think what these people want to know is okay Forget about what they might have done in the past forget about everything that's been in the news Who's gonna fight for me like what is each candidate gonna do for me? And I think that you know the Harris campaign will be making that case not just from Kamala Harris But from every single person in that organization including the thousands and thousands of volunteers they have Yeah, you know to that end What who's gonna fight for me who's gonna do the right thing for me This is a group of union workers Mallory who are Beneficiaries of the chips and science act right they're working on projects that are part of the you know the portfolio of Legislation passed under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and yet there seems to be a real disconnect In terms of how they feel about feel about their job prospects and the economy and what Joe Biden has done Specifically for them literally for them in the state of Michigan in their own livelihoods And I and I would imagine Therefore that that you know the people in the Union who can explain The the reality of what this democratic administration has done for these particular union workers are going to be the key To Harris winning Justin Palmerville is I believe one of the Union elders at local 85 And this is actually what he said to these union workers at the at the end of this meeting I want everybody to hear this because I think this is actually how you win the votes. Let's take a listen Thank you for spotlight in Saginaw County And it's it's been a it's been a great deal and one thing I did want to address So this room knows is the science and chips act they're not kidding We have hemlock semiconductor in this county and anybody that's working on project Phoenix or at hemlock semiconductor is making money directly out of the Biden administration bills sign That's something that we probably should have done a better job educating on if you're fabbing at W soul shop or you're fabbing and Any of these fab shops that are sending stuff out to SK siltron or Phoenix or HSC It's science and chips act money That is Kamala Harris and Joe Biden That's the ballgame right exactly that's it It is how do you connect you know when we hear the chips and science act those of us who think about policy all the time We know what that is in almost the academic sense. We know the dollars and we know what it's for But for the average person, what does it actually mean for me? you have to draw that connection you have to connect those dots and the other reality is a lot of the Net gains from this legislation is going to be delayed. It takes time for the money to come into the states It takes time for us in the state legislature to appropriate those dollars before the jobs actually start before the projects actually start So that is our job That is gonna be the job of the Harris walls campaign to really connect those dots in very plain length in 42 days Exactly no big deal John, you know what what what sort of stunned me about this is you have union workers here, right? They're in they're not in a southern border state their jobs are relatively secure They have money federal money flowing in to keep them in gainful livelihoods Of course inflation and housing are concerned but that the way immigration Animated a lot of the young men in the audience. I found to be stunning I think we have time to play another clip of land in Charbonneau who is I you know Was one of the many voices in the audience talking about migrants flowing over the border. Let's just take a listen to that clip again What's sort of made its way across your radar any any stories or issues or positions mostly just immigration Can you talk a little bit more about that? What what about immigration is have you been paying attention to? There are thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants coming across the border every day and the vice president has done minimal work to fix that Based on what I've seen so I'd like that to change. Do you feel like Donald Trump's gonna be better on that issue? Based on what we've seen on his first four years. I do believe that he will be better on that Do you are you leaning towards Trump right now? Yes, ma'am John you know this seems to exist I mean that the emotional pull of Trump's argument on immigration for these young white men Seems to be independent of economics. It it feels like it's something deeper and I think the work of a potentially the first Lady, you know the first female woman of color As president it's even harder for her to articulate, you know, the reassurance I think young male white workers need about a changing American demographic I mean, how do you look at the poll that Trump's immigration rhetoric has on a group of people who are not on the front lines Of their jobs being replaced by migrants Yeah, I mean look Trump and the entire Republican Party and the right-wing media have have concocted a story that We're being invaded by immigrants who are taking people's jobs, right? And so that information filters down and it becomes a powerful narrative now I think what Kamala Harris has already done is starting telling her own story about this She's talked about how she was attorney general of a state where she prosecuted transnational gangs and she also talked about the fact that There would be Border legislation as law right now that would have secured the southern border if Donald Trump Hadn't told his Republican allies in Congress to kill it and you know, she said in the debate He doesn't want to solve the problem. He wants to run on the issue and I think talking about that and then also talking about the fact that last time he was president that his only big legislative Accomplishment was a gigantic tax cut that went mostly for the rich and now he wants to slap a Trump tax That's gonna cost most families $4,000 a year on everyday goods that you buy and what she wants to do is make owning a home more affordable And give a middle-class tax cut to about a hundred million Americans So I think she's got to just tell that story and point out the game what Trump is trying to do He doesn't really care about the issue of immigration He's just using it for politics and what she wants to do is to continue to To fight for middle-class families like the like the union workers you talked to Mallory I know you have thoughts on this I do so there was recent polling in Michigan that shows that almost 75% of Michiganders want a path to citizenship It is a very small number of people in Michigan who support Trump's idea of mass deportation This is an area where I think vice president Harris should lean into her prosecutor credentials talk about prosecuting transnational gangs and push back on the fear-mongering and the lies that Donald Trump and JD pan JD Vance are painting all immigrants even legal immigrants look at what is happening in Springfield as if it is this mass horrible Problem that does make these workers feel like their job is at risk when it's not yeah
