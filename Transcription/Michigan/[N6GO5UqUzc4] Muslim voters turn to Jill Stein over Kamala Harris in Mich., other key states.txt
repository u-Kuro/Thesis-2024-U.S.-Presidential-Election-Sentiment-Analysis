 A poll surveying Muslim voters in Michigan found that many are moving away from Vice President Kamala Harris and supporting Green Party nominee Jill Stein this November. The poll, conducted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, showed Stein had 40 percent support of Muslim voters in Michigan, Donald Trump had 18 percent support, and Harris had 12 percent. The poll also found Stein was leading Harris among Muslim voters in Arizona and Wisconsin, key battleground states. A Reuters report stated, the uncommitted national movement said it would not back Harris even though it opposes Trump and won't recommend a third-party vote. It said Trump would accelerate the killing in Gaza if re-elected, but Harris would not respond to its request she meet with Palestinian Americans who lost loved ones in Gaza and had not agreed to discuss halting arms shipments to Israel. The Muslim vote in these states could be crucial this November. Consider this, the uncommitted movement, which encouraged voters frustrated by the Biden administration's Israel policy to vote uncommitted in the Democratic primary, garnered 750,000 votes. That could impact states that have been decided by less than a percent during recent presidential elections. Michigan was decided by 11,000 votes in 2016. Georgia decided by 11,000 votes in 2020. Wisconsin was decided by 27,000 votes in 2016. The Harris campaign told Reuters it was committed to earning every vote and ending the war in Gaza.
