 Let me bring our political director, Washington bureau chief Rick Klein, the latest polling on the race, and we've really seen the race transformed since Kamala Harris got in. Yeah, good morning, George. We have seen real momentum for Vice President Harris, and it is transferring into the places where the election is most likely to be decided. This is where Joe Biden stood at the day he dropped out. You see momentum for Harris in every single one of the major battleground states, including the big three, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Harris now slightly favored in the 538 polling average in all three. And as she turns to her choice for running mate, we're seeing that most Americans don't really have an opinion of any of them, but to the extent they do, we're seeing some relatively positive numbers for people, including Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro. Shapiro, of course, although he's in that well-known nationally, very popular in his home state of Pennsylvania, which may be the most important state on the map this year. George. Thank you, Rick. Thanks very much.
