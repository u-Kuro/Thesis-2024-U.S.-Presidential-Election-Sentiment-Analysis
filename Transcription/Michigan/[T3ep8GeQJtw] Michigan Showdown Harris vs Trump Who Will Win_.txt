 Big moves in Michigan. Harris and Trump are making waves in the battleground state, and voters are the prize. Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump landed in Michigan on the same day. Why? Michigan's 15 electoral votes are up for grabs. Harris took aim at Trump's economic track record, especially on manufacturing. She's pushing a strong pro-union message, promising jobs for workers without college degrees. Trump, on the other hand, promised to boost American auto manufacturing by slapping tariffs on imported vehicles. He's focusing on hamtramck, home to many Arab American voters. Harris didn't ignore this group either. She acknowledged their struggles with the Israel-Palestine conflict and emphasized diplomacy for peace. Trump's appeal? He's targeting those dissatisfied with the current administration's foreign policy. It's a high-stakes game in Michigan, with both sides pulling out all the stops. Stay tuned because this battle is far from over.
