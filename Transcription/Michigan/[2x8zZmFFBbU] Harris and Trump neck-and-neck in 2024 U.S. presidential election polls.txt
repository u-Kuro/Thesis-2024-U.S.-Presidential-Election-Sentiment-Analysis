 The 2024 U.S. presidential election is nearing the close with polling for the two candidates. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump showing only a small margin of difference in recent opinion surveys. Our An Sung-jin takes a closer look at them. With around 40 days left to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the two candidates are seeing a neck and neck race. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is enjoying a slight lead in a recent CBS poll released on Sunday, which was conducted on more than 3,000 registered voters. Though within the margin of error, 52 percent of voters responded in favor of Harris, while 48 percent went for Trump. In individual battleground states, the difference was even less. In a poll conducted on voters from seven swing states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Nevada, Harris was ahead by one to two percentage points compared to the former president. This comes as heated exchanges continue between the two candidates, including the call for a second debate. Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN to participate in another debate with her counterpart, as she is set to release new economic proposals this week. However, Trump has turned this down. Meanwhile, in a recent appearance on TV, Trump stated that he will not run in the 2028 presidential elections if he loses. If he wins this election in November, based on the constitution, he will be unable to run for a third term. This implies that regardless of the election results, the 2024 election will be Trump's last. An Seong-jin, Arirang News.
