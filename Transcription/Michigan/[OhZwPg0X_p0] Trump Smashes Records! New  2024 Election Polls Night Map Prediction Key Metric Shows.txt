 Hello my friends, welcome back today. There is a lot of update from key states. We will examine Trump's incredible surge over the last month. I'll assign ratings to our map such as likely lean, tilt, and toss up. Let's get right to it. First in Arizona, according to the 11 most recent polls done within the last three weeks, Trump now leads Harris by an average of 1.1%, with Trump at 48.4% and Harris at 47.3%. When looking back at previous polling blunders in Arizona, Republican presidential candidates have consistently outperformed the polls by an average of 2.3% over the last four election cycles. For example, in 2020, surveys understated Trump by precisely 2.3%, whereas Biden won by only 0.3% despite having a 2.6% advantage in the polling average heading into election day. Arizona stands noteworthy because the Republican candidate has been overlooked in all four previous elections. In 2008, John McCain led by 5 points. Romney won by 1.6 points in 2012, 1.8 points in 2016, and 2.3 points in 2022. Trump's lead would thus grow to 3.4% by incorporating the weighted polling error average of R plus 2.3 into the current real clear polling average, which includes 1.1% to 2.3 of the average polling error. Our margin categories would place Arizona in the lean Republican column, which is shown by the second lightest shade of red on the map. For your reference, margins less than 2.5% are tilt margins between 2.5% and 7%, are lean 7% to 10% likely and greater than 10% safe. Colorado's next, worth 10 electoral votes and one of the fastest left trending states in the country. It is no longer a factor for Trump in the Republican party, as seen by our only poll after President Biden's withdrawal from the race. In comparison to Biden's nearly 14-point victory in 2020, Harris leads by 11 points, which is relatively underperformance. But looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that Democrats have been underrated by 1.8% on average over the last four cycles. Surprisingly, Colorado is the only state where Democrats have been underrated across all four cycles. Adding well 1.8% to Harris' margin produces a Harris plus 12.8 final outcome, which is more than enough to place Colorado in the safe blue column on our map. Florida is next, the electoral powerhouse with 30 votes online, with Trump holding 50.3% and Harris 42%. According to the average of the latest six surveys, Trump currently leads Harris by 6.0%. Trump's large lead here is unsurprising given Florida's recent election cycles significant rightward tilt. Examining historical polling error, Florida has undervalued Republicans by an average of 2.5% since 2008. Biden lead the final polling average by 2.5 points in 2020. As a result, the inaccuracy was particularly evident there. Nevertheless, Trump won by 3.4%, the largest margin for a presidential candidate in Florida since 2004. Florida was also one of the few states where Trump performed better in 2020 than in the 2016 election. Adjusting for previous polling error, Trump's current six-point lead over Harris in the real clear average rises to 8.5%. On our electoral map, this solidifies Florida as a likely Republican state. Let's head north of Florida to Georgia where Trump leads by half a percentage point, 48.3% to 47.08%. This race is very close and within the margin of error. Unlike many other battleground states, Georgia's polls have been very accurate over the last 10 years including 2016 and 2020, which is particularly interesting here. Trump underperformed in several other states but he was only underrated in Georgia by a point. Based on historical polling error, Democrats have a 0.5% overall weighted average bias. Making that small modification to the current polling average increases Trump's lead from 0.5% to 1%, keeping Georgia's tilt. Arizona and Georgia are in the Republican column with D plus 0.2 and D plus 0.3 respectively. Both states were the closest in 2020. Thus along with Arizona, this would be Trump's second flip. Now we're heading into the important Midwest, starting with Iowa, one of the fastest right trending states in the country. Since Biden's withdrawal, there has been no poll between Trump and Harris, while it was still significantly more competitive than in some other states where many polls have been released. Iowa voted Donald Trump by large margins in 2016 and 2020. Without current polls based on Trump's 20 margin of plus 8, Iowa will be classified as most likely Republican, with an average error of 4.6%. Iowa has one of the largest polling underestimations of Republicans in recent cycles. For what it's worth, this includes 6 to 7 point underestimations of Trump in both 2016 and 2020, strengthening its likely Republican status on our map. We go on to Maine, which is now in the Northeast this cycle, where only three polls have been published and averaged out. Harris leads by 11.6% over Biden's 9 point victory in 2020. This demonstrates an overperformance in polling. Maine has historically overestimated Democratic presidential candidates by somewhat less than a point. Maine will be placed in the safe Democrat category on our map after Harris's lead in Maine fell by 10.7%. Nonetheless, a significant Democratic margin is corrected for that polling mistake based on their 2020 results. Maine's second district is likely to vote Republican, while Nebraska's second district leans Democratic. Let us now journey to Michigan, the first of our three rust belt core states based on demography and fundamental principles. Michigan is possibly the bluest of the three, especially after its 3 point 2020 Biden vote. But in 2024, Trump has recently led in the polling average by 0.9%, with 48.5%, to Harris's 47% according to the last 10 polls. Harris is particularly concerned about this shift, as she has consistently led Trump by 1 to 2 points since becoming the Democratic nominee. The fact that Michigan surveys have consistently undervalued Republicans by 1.7% on average. Trump's increase of 3.5% in 2016 and 5.0% in 2020 is very concerning. Applying that 1.7% polling error to Trump's current margin increases his lead to 2.6%. Putting Michigan in the lean Republican category, on our chart, Harris's path to success is dependent on Michigan, as it is often expected of rust belt neighbors Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Losing all three would undoubtedly throw Harris's path to 270 electoral votes off track, starting two states to the west. Our next state is Minnesota, where real clear polling shows Harris leading her running mate Tim Walz's home state by 4.7% on average over the last four polls, ranging from Harris plus 3 to Harris plus 6 from 49% to 44.3% compared to Biden's 7-point margin four years ago. This would be more than a 2-point underperformance by Harris. On our page, Minnesota's overall weighted error is R plus 2, indicating that Republicans have been undervalued to a similar degree as Michigan, Florida, and Arizona. Clinton led by more than 7 points going into election day, yet she was only 1.5 points away from a shocking loss. So Minnesota's biggest mistake happened in 2016. Kamala Harris's advantage has shrunk to 2.7% with a 2-point shift in the poll average, which remains leaning Democratic. Regardless, Minnesota's 10 electoral votes are counted. Toward the vice presidential total, turning back west to Nevada, Trump has a 0.2% lead in the current polling average, fueled primarily by a recent Wall Street Journal survey that showed Trump ahead by 6 points among 600 registered voters. Given that Nevada has voted blue in each of the previous four presidential elections, this is the first time Trump has led in Nevada since late August, another troubling trend for Harris. Interestingly, Nevada's polling history shows a little overestimation of Republican support, with an average bias of 0.6% in their favor. This places Nevada among only four states where Democrats have been underestimated in our pages. While polls overestimated Biden's success in 2020, as they did in practically every other state, polls underestimated Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in 2016, 2012, and 2008. If we adjust Trump's narrow advantage to reflect historical bias, the outcome becomes a small Harris lead of 0.4%, which is still inside the margin of error. Still, this is enough for Nevada to lean toward Harris on our electoral map. Up next in New England is New Hampshire, which Biden won by 7 points in 2020. Like Minnesota, Trump came close to flipping it in 2016 before emphatically returning it to the Democratic column. Harris leads Trump by 7.4%, according to the most current average of actual clear polls, a slight increase over Biden's advantage in 2020. However, New Hampshire has two previous polling errors. Thus, like Minnesota, the GOP has been underestimated by two points on average. The miscalculation was the same in 2016 and 2020, with Trump undervalued by 3.8% in each election. Using that two-point swing to the current polling average, Harris's lead falls from 7.4% to 5.4%, converting New Hampshire from likely Democrat to lean Democrat on our map. While New Mexico votes to the right of neighboring Colorado for the first time in more than 50 years in 2020, this pattern is predicted to persist through November. Compared to Biden's 11-point triumph in 2020, Harris leads Trump by 8 points on average in the last 3 polls. New Mexico is one of four states where Republican support has been exaggerated. However, since 2008, the average polling error has been 1.3. Harris's lead has increased from 8 to 9.3 points. New Mexico remains firmly in the likely Democrat area on our map as we move on to North Carolina, where the actual clear polling average shows Trump with a paltry 0.5% advantage over Harris, 48.2% to 48.7%. This average is based on 11 polls in total. Trump leads in 7, Harris leads in 1, and 3 are tied. Although all of these polls have a margin of error, the only one that shows Harris ahead is from less reliable pollster Atlas info which examines prior polling failures. North Carolina has a history of overstretching Democrats by 2.5% for example. In 2020, the final polling average showed Biden ahead by over 2 points, yet Trump won the state by 1.4%. In 2016, polls likewise favored Clinton, but Trump won by over 4 points after accounting for 2.5%. Historical polling mistake, Trump's lead has risen from 0.5% to precisely 3%. On our electoral map, North Carolina is suddenly leaning Republican, returning to the Midwest. Ohio was previously viewed as the perfect bellwether, but is now dependably Republican according to the average of the most recent 7 surveys. According to real clear polling, Trump leads by 7.4%. Fascinatingly, Trump has led by exactly 6 points in each of the last 3 surveys, implying a modest underperformance compared to his 8-point victory margins in 2016 and 2020. Having said that, Ohio has one of the largest average polling errors associated with Iowa at R plus 4.6%. While Barack Obama was underrated in 2008 and 2012 when he won the state, Trump outperformed his narrow polling advantages in 2016 and 2020 by 6.5% and 7.2% respectively. For example, he led Biden by just then a point in 5.30, 8's final average in 2020, but he ultimately won by 8 points, correcting for Ohio's past polling errors. Trump's lead grows from 7.4% to 12%, shifting Ohio from probable Republican to safe Republican. On our graphic, Trump leads with 237 votes just ahead of Harris with 219, leaving 82 votes up for grabs with only 4 states remaining and neither candidate having yet received 270 electoral votes. Let us now focus our attention to Pennsylvania, one of the most important battleground states in 2024. According to real clear polling, Trump is now leading by 0.3% with 48.3% of the vote to Harris's 48%. Trump has led in 7 of the last 12 polls, establishing the first sustained advantage he has had in Pennsylvania in some time. Pennsylvania polls have traditionally underestimated Trump. Hillary Clinton led by 4.1% in the polls before election day in 2016, but Trump won by 0.7%. While Biden's victory was widely expected in 2020, polls overestimated his lead by 3.5 points. The average bias turns out to be 2.2%. With this update, Trump's lead grows to 2.5%, defining Pennsylvania as a lean Republican. Given that Texas is still developing, this should all but ensure Trump's victory as he now heads to Texas, the second largest state with 40 electoral votes. Online, real clear polling shows Trump leading by 5.7%, nearly identical to his 5.6% victory in 2016, owing primarily to a 4.5-point underestimation of Trump in 2020, whereas 5.38 put Biden within one point. Texas has consistently overstated Democratic support by 1.9% since 2008, but Trump won by 5.6%, making the modification. Trump's lead in Texas expands to 7.6%, shifting our map from lean to likely Republican. With two states remaining, Trump surpasses the 270-vote threshold and receives 296 electoral votes, ensuring his win. Let us now head to Virginia, where the most recent poll average shows Harris leading by roughly 6-5 points. Although Harris continues to underperform, the Commonwealth voted for Biden by 10 points in 2020, giving Democrats the largest margin they've had, all cycle memory. Biden trailed Trump here when he was still running. That is noteworthy, given that Virginia's previous polling has been among the most accurate. Misses in 2016 and 2020 are within 2 points. After controlling for weighted error, Harris' lead increases slightly from 6 over 4% to 6.5%, despite the very tiny polling flaws. As a result, on our electoral map, Virginia will be classified as Leaning Democrat. We conclude out the movie with Wisconsin, where Kamala Harris trails Donald Trump by a startlingly thin 3% margin. Harris, like Michigan and Pennsylvania, has led since late July. She hasn't completely lost her edge here yet. In terms of polling errors, Wisconsin has had among the largest underestimations of Trump in previous cycles. Hillary Clinton lost by 0.8% in 2016, but was up by 5.9% in the final average. Biden led by 8.4% in 2020, but won by a mere 0.7% among very competitive states. R4.3 represents the overall weighted polling error. It's highest here, applying the 4.3-point adjustment to Trump's 4-point edge completely reverses Harris Slim's lead. Wisconsin's election map goes from tilt Democrat to lean Republican. Donald Trump would thus win the 2024 presidential election with 306 electoral votes to Kamala Harris' 232, based on the most recent polling averages in major battlegrounds around the country, adjusted by the average error in the previous four presidential elections.
