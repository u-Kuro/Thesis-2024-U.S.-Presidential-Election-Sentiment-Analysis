 We're all from the Kalamazoo area and all very big supporters of Kamala and Michelle and so we were super excited to come here. And we all registered and then we all did you get a ticket? Did you get a ticket? It helps obviously Michigan as a swing state. I figured they went to Grand Rapids, they went to Detroit. I never in a million years thought they would come to Kalamazoo. So it means a lot. It means a lot to all of us and I mean, look at this turnout. And as a woman, I'm just so excited that our next president is going to be a woman and a woman of color. I don't wanna think about the other possibility, not on today anyways. I'm too happy and excited. If I think about the other possibility, it'll just bring me down. We started when the election started and we're doing it to fund the election for Kamala Harris. I mean, it's a wonderful decision that she's making to support the community and show that she's a good president. Girl power. She could never have imagined the possibility of Madam President looking like this. But it is a monumental historical moment, which is another reason we're here to see a woman running for president and being elected president. Right.
