 Last night we know with Michigan, President Trump, I've said this before, you get past New Hampshire with a big win, which he did, in South Carolina with an overwhelming majority win, which he did, then you want to start getting big wins so that the media, left wing media stop saying, oh, 45% of the Republicans still don't like you. But in Michigan last night where Nikki Haley was able to spend some resources, but not as many as she did, like in South Carolina, I've said from the beginning, you need to start seeing President Trump get to 70 to 75%. So on Super Tuesday, that's that key number, and that's about where he got last night. 15 states, when one US territory are voting on Super Tuesday, there's 874 delegates available on Super Tuesday. But about two thirds are in states with open or semi-open primaries. I still expected all of those, President Trump, to win big. Yeah, at this point I don't see how he does it. Maybe there's some voters that go in and decide to try to cause a little bit of disruption there, but I really don't see it.
