 New poll numbers released just moments ago. It shows where voters here at home stand when it comes to electing both a US president and a new US senator. Rick Albin is in our newsroom to break down those results. Rick. New polling for Wood TV by Emerson College on the Hill show that after a whirlwind few weeks of first replacing Joe Biden and then heading to the Democratic Convention for the nomination, Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump in Michigan. The first polling since the convention of 800 likely voters in Michigan finds that fully 50% of those asked said they would vote for Vice President Harris. 47% said that they will vote for former President Trump. 3% are undecided. The poll has an error rate of plus or minus 3.4%. In the same survey, voters were asked about the race for US Senate here in Michigan. In that case, Alyssa Slotkin leads Mike Rogers with 47% saying they would vote for the Democrat if the race were held today. 41% say they would vote for Republican Rogers. This poll was conducted August 26th through 28th, so it's a very fresh impression of what's going on here in battleground Michigan, and the reason we'll be seeing a lot more candidate visits between now and November.
