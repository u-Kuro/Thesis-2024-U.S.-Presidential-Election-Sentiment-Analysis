 College Republicans at ASU, Arizona State University, question the legality of campaigns access to student data and demand transparency from the school. In an incredible report, Arizona State University, a public university, apparently allowed Harris' campaign to send a mass text to all 70,000 students encouraging them to vote for her. The college Republicans have raised a protest, but now that the deed is done, there's not much that can be done about it. This does raise the issue about college students voting. Should they vote in their home districts and not the college location where they only live temporarily? How is the situation monitored so they do not vote in both places? Inquiring minds want to know. This is Dr. David D. Shine for Saving America. Please subscribe on your favorite platform.
