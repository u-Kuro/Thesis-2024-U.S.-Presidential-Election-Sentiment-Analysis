 I'm a voter from Michigan and a community organizer that has been on the ground speaking to Democratic voters. And right now, the majority of Michigan voters, which is a key swing state in the race of the White House, right now cannot put their support behind Vice President Harris in her race of the White House in combating a Trump presidency. And so what we need right now is a policy change. But we'll, by specific Harris, signal to Democratic voters, 101,000 in Michigan, that she will end the killing and occupation of Palestinians. So we have that fighting chance, and no governor. Not only because it's immoral and right-wing to do, but because we need to fight fascism, not only here at home, but also abroad. So yes, I think that she is at risk for losing peace between swing states, especially in states like Michigan, where we have the largest concentration of Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, people who know firsthand the effects and the impact of American-funded bombing. I just wanted to emulate, again, a name that is from Chicago, Illinois. And every day that I talk to my friends who are politically involved, people who knock doors every day, who are involved in elected campaigns across Chicago and Illinois, and every day they say, we want to open this administration. We want to be part of this movement. We are excited. But there's one thing that every day we wait on time. Looking at our phones and people, bodies and children, live somewhere. We want to be proud of this party. That every day that I talk to my neighbors, people of color, young people in my community, they say, we want to see Mother Harris change the page, change the policy, come up bold. We want to be excited. We want to be knocking on those doors. So please help us do that. Help us help you. Next question.
