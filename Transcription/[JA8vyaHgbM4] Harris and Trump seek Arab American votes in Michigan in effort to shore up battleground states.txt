 What I wish I knew at the start of this election season, the power of the Arab American vote in Michigan. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are laser focused on Michigan, folks. Why? The Arab American community here is a political powerhouse. Harris aims to win their hearts by emphasizing her administration's actions, like extending legal status to Lebanese citizens. But Trump isn't backing down. He's softening his past rhetoric and even got an endorsement from the Trump Democratic mayor. Both candidates know the swing state can make or break their campaigns. Harris is doubling down on her support for the community, while Trump's strategy is to leverage dissatisfaction with the current administration by it's a high stakes game where every vote counts. So whether you're team Harris or team Trump, remember your vote has the power to shape the future. Michigan, the stock lights on you.
