 Tuba City is in the heart of the Navajo Nation. The people of this impoverished and often overlooked region could be the key to Kamala Harris' hopes of winning the presidency. Here, people in there are Tuba City or Democrat people, mostly. So we voted for Kamala Harris. Then I think that Donald Trump is the wrong person to put in office again. We need Kamala, you know, and I'm all blue, you know, everything, my election, my vote. It's for Democrat. Former Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez is trying to make history. I am vying to be the first indigenous person, first Native American to be elected from Arizona to the U.S. House of Representatives. His candidacy could drive turnout, boosting Harris. They'll end up voting for other candidates on the ballot and most likely they'll be Democrats. Indigenous rights advocates say Native political power is underestimated. Native Americans absolutely have the power to determine the outcome of the next presidential election and certainly many elections in their local and county jurisdictions as well. Harris has targeted Native voters with ads like this one and has 20 paid staffers organizing on tribal lands. The relationship between tribal nations and the United States is sacred. Last week, her running mate Tim Waltz held a rally on the Navajo Nation. Those Harris campaign efforts seem to be paying off based on what we saw and heard on our visit here in Tuba City. Donald Trump is not popular here. The stuff he does, I don't understand, you know, a riot on the Capitol. You know, that's something we don't do. You know, it's a no-no. There's a steady trickle of early voters casting ballots at a polling place nearby. And that's where we met nursing student Michaela Billy, who had just voted for Harris. I think Kamala would be a benefit to my Native American population, to my people. A rugged land and a proud people who may hold the keys to the White House.
