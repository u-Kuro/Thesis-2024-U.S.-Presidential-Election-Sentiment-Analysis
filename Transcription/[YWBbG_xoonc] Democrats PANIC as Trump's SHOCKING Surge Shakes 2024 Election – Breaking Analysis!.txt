 In the most recent polls released in all the important swing states, Donald Trump has totally blown Harris out of the water. With consideration for the most recent polls in every 50 state, I will be changing my 2024 Electoral College map today. Beginning with Trump's safe states, we have Montana, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska at large, and its first and third districts, Missouri, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana, and Alaska. Trump starts with a strong 98 electoral vote basis. Now we proceed to Kamala Harris's safe states, and we can bet on Washington, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont, D.C., Delaware, Maine's first district, Maine at large, and New York. With the solid states filled in, Harris leads with 157 electoral votes to the 98. Previous president, we will now now focus on the likely states that would show which would go to either Trump or Harris depending on margins between 7 and 15 percent points. These states seem not like they might turn come November. For the past six elections, Arkansas has been a consistent Republican state. Right now, Trump finds favor in this state. A Hendrix College poll among the 696 likely voters reveals Trump leading Harris by 15 points. Arkansas is therefore almost a safe Republican state. Arkansas is definitely likely to remain red in this election cycle, given such a large margin. Still in Trump's likely column, Mississippi keeps its reputation as a constantly red state. Recent polls, however, show Trump leading Harris by 9 points, a margin that is substantially less than in past elections. Trump won Mississippi by 16.5 points in 2020, pointing out some Republican-based corrosion this cycle. Notwithstanding this change, Mississippi is still projected to remain in Trump's favor this election cycle, thanks to the longstanding Republican support of the state motivated by conservatives. Retaining its reputation as a Republican bastion, South Carolina is still likely state for Trump. Close to the outcomes of past elections where Trump won the state by 14.3.3 points in 2016 and 11.7 points in 2020, a recent Winthrop University Center survey reveals Trump leading Harris by a strong 10 points. With strong GOP support from its rural and evangelical voters, South Carolina's political scene has stayed constant. Though detailed polling on a Harris against Trump fight is presently lacking, historical patterns point to South Carolina staying firmly in Trump's camp. Turning now to the blue side, we first begin with Virginia, which based on a fresh poll by Christopher Newport University among 800 likely voters, has now confirmed its likely classification for Harris. The poll reveals Harris leading Trump by 11 points, so clearly strengthening her position. This change supports Virginia's consistent Democratic reputation despite past competitiveness. With an 11 point lead, Harris seems to be keeping a steady advantage in Virginia as election day draws near, so firmly putting the state on the Democratic side. Colorado stays squarely in Harris's likely column, according to most recent polls, which show her leading with 10 points. This illustrates the strong Democratic support of the state in recent years, a change that has been developing since the 2008 election, when Colorado moved from a swing state to a more consistently blue state. Biden's 13.5 point margin of victory in Colorado in the 2020 contest strengthened its Democratic inclination even further. Should Harris keep her present lead, it would confirm Colorado's Democratic dominance in 2024, supported by progressive urban areas and a varied population leaning Democratic. With 15.9 points, New Jersey's 2020 deep blue state ranked with the current live poll among 400 potential voters showing Harris leading by 12 points. The most recent poll indicates that same will be true come November. Originally a historically competitive district, Nebraska's second one has moved more in Harris's favor, now regarded as a likely Democratic nominee's triumph. According to the most recent poll by the New York Times slash Sienna College, among 680 likely voters, Harris leads Trump by nine points. Omaha and its environs make up this district, which has undergone altering political attitudes and changing demographics that adds to its competitiveness recently. Biden gained this district by 6.6 points in 2020. With Harris's present nine point edge, it seems likely to stay in the Democratic column for 2024. Rhode Island stays in the maybe category for Harris, but the most recent poll by Embolt Research confirms her lead. With a healthy margin of 14 points over Trump, the poll, which polled 876 potential voters, showcases Harris with a long-standing Democratic stronghold posture reinforced. Every presidential contest Rhode Island has voted blue consistently since 1988. With the most recent poll from SurveyUSA of 619 likely voters showing her having an eight point advantage over Trump, New Mexico stays in Harris's likely column. This margin shows a minor tightening relative to Biden's 2020 state triumph, in which he scored 10.8 points. Trump's growing popularity among Hispanic voters, which has made the election in New Mexico more competitive, can help to explain the closing divide. Harris still has a pleasant edge going into the election though, with an eight point lead. Though things are not yet finalized as some startling surveys approaching very soon will turn the tide red once again. Harris with 204 points and Trump on 119 mark the likely category finishes. We will now proceed to the leaning category, in which the particular candidate is leading by a margin of two to seven points. Based on the poll among 1002 potential voters, Ohio still is a firmly Republican state. The poll reveals Trump leading Harris by seven points, therefore supporting Ohio's recent GOP turnabout in elections. Even if Trump's edge in Ohio has somewhat dropped from 2016 and 2020 when he prevailed by more than eight points, the state still seems to be definitely in Trump's advantage. Reliable on his electoral map for 2024, Ohio's conservative working-class voter base still supports the former president. With the most recent poll by Pan-Atlantic Research finding 398 likely voters, showing Trump leading Harris by seven points, Maine's second district has clearly turned firmly in favor of him. With Trump winning by 7.3 points in 2020, this district, known for its independent streak, has regularly skewed Republican in recent election cycles. According to the fresh statistics, Trump still has a clear edge in this rural area, hence his 2024 campaign targets this area especially. Turning now to Texas, which falls into the lean category for Trump based on the most recent Marist College survey among 1,486 probably voters. The survey indicates Trump leading Harris by seven points, meaning Texas still leans Republican even if the race is competitive. Reflecting the changing demographics and rising urban populations in areas like Austin, Houston, and Dallas, Trump's lead has marginally dropped from prior surveys displaying a greater margin. Still, Trump has a strong advantage with a seven-point lead, therefore making Texas a vital state for his campaign in 2024. Turning now to Iowa, the most recent signal study of 600 likely voters reveals Trump leading Harris by seven points. This is a decline from past polls, but the state being reported fits his past record here, where Trump prevailed by 8.2 points in 2020 and 9.4 points in 2016. Originally a competitive battleground, Iowa has changed in recent years to become a more consistently Republican state, mostly because of its rural conservative voting base and great support of Trump's populist platform. Arizona has officially entered the lean category for Trump since the most recent survey from Siena College among 808 registered voters now shows Trump a five-point edge over Harris. This turn towards Trump illustrates the continuous difficulties Democrats in this border state, which shares a major border with Mexico face, which has been crucial in determining voter mood. Trump prevailed 3.5 points in Arizona in 2016, while in 2020 the state turned to Biden by just 0.31 points. Arizona is still very competitive, but right now Trump leads going into the last run of the campaign. Turning now to Florida, the most recent survey taken among 1,410 registered voters by Marist College reveals Trump leading Harris by four points. Long a vital swing state, Florida's vast and varied population typically reflects national patterns. With Florida's 30 electoral votes online, any more narrowing of the race might place the GOP in a difficult posture. As usual, turnout in important places like the I-4 corridor in South Florida will probably determine Florida, therefore influencing the outcome in any direction. With the most recent poll taken among 800 potential voters by Fabrizio Lee and associates revealing Trump having a three-point advantage against Harris, Nevada has somewhat changed in favor of him. Nevada is once again under contention as a battleground state due to its limited margin. Biden won Nevada by 2.4 points in 2020, but with its varied population and robust union presence, the state's political scene stays competitive. Given six electoral votes at play, both campaigns will probably concentrate mostly on Nevada when the race becomes close, and Trump's three-point lead makes this a crucial state to keep an eye on over the last stages of the campaign. We shall now turn toward the blue side. New Hampshire shows an unusual electoral change and supports Harris. Clinton barely passed Trump in 2016 with just 37 points. Biden expanded his edge to 7.4 points by 2020, effectively confirming the Democratic grip of the state. Early 2024 polls revealed a closer race when Biden was the expected nominee. But Harris has entered the race, so she has been able to maintain the difference. Now displaying Harris with a seven-point advantage over Trump, the St. Anselm College Survey Center poll suggests that New Hampshire is likely to remain blue as the election draws near. Minnesota also falls in the lean category for Harris. The most recent polls suggest a minor Democratic candidate edge. A fresh active vote poll among 400 potential voters shows Harris leading Trump by six points. This margin shows that the contest is still competitive, even if Minnesota keeps leaning Democratic. Minnesota swung toward the Democrats in both 2016 and 2020. Biden emerged a 7.1 point advantage. Harris's present six-point lead points to a race more like to those of past elections. Minnesota's reputation as a major state to keep under observation is still unaltered. And as election day draws near, both camps are probably going to boost their efforts here. Oregon, on the other hand, seems to be headed opposite direction. Biden had 16.1 points in 2020, a deep blue state. Early polls in 2024 kept it in the likely category with a margin of double digits. But ever since Harris joined the party, the discrepancy for the DNC has been more than half reduced in this state. Falling to the lean category with a five-point lead based on a poll among 700 potential voters. With the most recent survey taken by the Philadelphia Inquirer, with 857 likely voters displaying Harris up by four points, Pennsylvania has returned into the lean category for Harris. Biden barely won by 1.2 points in 2020, hence this is a significant change in one of the most vital battleground states. Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes are up for grabs, hence this small margin emphasizes the intense competitiveness in this state. Given Pennsylvania's ongoing importance in deciding the general result of the election, both campaigns are expected to center mostly on that state. Harris is still leading, albeit the difference is closed. Now moving into the swing states, everything will change. These are the ones displaying a margin of two points or less. With the most recent survey taken among 800 potential voters revealing Trump leading Harris by one point, Wisconsin has entered the swing category for Trump. With Biden just winning by just 0.63 points in 2020, this gap indicates Wisconsin's ongoing importance as a major battleground state. Trump's one-point lead points to his present edge in the state, even if the election is still competitive. Given Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes could be crucial in deciding the 2024 election result, both campaigns are likely to substantially invest in the state. Kansas now falls into the swing category. The most recent poll reveals a two-point lead for the former president. From the double-digit margins Kansas has given Republicans in the past, this is a clear drop. Although Trump won Kansas by 14% in 2020, this little margin speaks to a change maybe resulting from shifting political dynamics and demographics inside the state. With the most recent insider advantage poll, Michigan has turned the tide on Trump, giving the former president two points out of 800 probably voters. For Trump, North Carolina now falls under the swing range. Based on the poll taken among 800 potential voters by Fabrizio Lee and associates, Trump leads Harris by one point, therefore confirming his limited advantage in this important battleground state. Trump won North Carolina by 1.3 points in 2020. Although the state is still rather competitive, Trump's present margin points it in the Republican column for now. North Carolina will remain a vital target for both camps as they try to hold the state in the last run of the election with 15 electoral votes online. Recently Georgia voted in favor of Trump. Redfield and Wilton strategy's newest poll among 600 potential voters shows Trump a one-point advantage over Kamala Harris. Donald Trump currently concludes the campaign with 293 electoral college points for Harris's 245, so he will be president come November. I really appreciate you folks watching.
