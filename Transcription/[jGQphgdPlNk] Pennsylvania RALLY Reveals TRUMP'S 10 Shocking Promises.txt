 10 important points what Trump focused exactly in Pennsylvania's rally. So I'm gonna talk about 10 most important points, but before that subscribe to channel and hit the like button and so it encourages me to make more and more videos for you guys. So do that. So the first thing he absolutely goes very clear that he's absolutely focused to repair America 100% in all the sectors. Of course and I believe him that he wants to repair this country because this country has been going through a lot in the negative way. Number two he'll he'll be taking very serious action on transgenders. So what that means of course he will not eliminate them but only he's telling that he will stop this all nonsense stuff what they're teaching in schools like operation changing the genders or women's sorry men's competing in the women's sports all these kind of stuffs he will stop this bullshit. So of course and I agree with him. And number three Trump will be banning men competing in women's sports it at whatever cost it takes he will ban that absolutely 100%. Number four he'll be taking very serious actions on open borders what America is facing right now. So of course he'll be closing the borders and he will be taking the serious action. So what that exactly mean for America that means illegal immigrants. He doesn't want illegal immigrants as this was the same agenda when he was when he was a president four years ago. So now he wants the same but now he wants something really hard really secure for America really something prosperous for America. So number five he'll be closing all the borders and clean up all the criminals from America and make America clean again. I'm not talking about the clean again on the streets he's talking about about the criminals. Of course after the assassination he realized that this country is no more a safe place. Now he will do that I'm 100% sure about this he will clean America like anything like it was never before because it he experienced directly on himself so of course he will do that he'll make America clean again and I'm pretty sure about that. And the next number six Trump will lower grocery prices and also fuel prices this is amazing for everyone who is living in United States as a legal residence. Of course the citizens and the residents of course they will be benefit from this lower the grocery price. So especially the lower grade families who are making less money and not able to save a lot of money and they have a little bit bigger families and they are just ending up spending all their money so for them it'll be a big push a big plus point and the next also is he'll be cutting the tax rates for the people who are working really hard extra hours for they'll be not they'll be not paying any tax for that so that will be the biggest turning point for these kind of family members. And the next is Trump will 100% focus on cutting down the tax from 25% to 15% for companies who will manufacture in United States for example XYZ company manufactures in China and now they want to they are paying 25% tax and let's say example I'm telling you let's say they are they start manufacturing in United States so Trump promises for them to charge less tax so probably like around 15% tax and that will be really in benefit for America because it will bring a lot of jobs because he wants to bring jobs in the United States he doesn't want people to really starve or remain without jobs and all the foreigners are really coming here and just grabbing all the jobs and the Americans are really remaining behind without any jobs I'm talking about them skilled workers I'm not talking about the unskilled workers so the next is 37 days from now Trump says very very clear he's going to defeat lion Kamala Harris and sleepy Joe it makes me a little bit laugh the way because the way he says lion Kamala Harris and the sleepy Joe that's the reason it makes me laugh that's the only reason and I don't laugh on Kamala Harris or sleepy Joe because he's funny sometimes the next is Trump promises to lower the taxes and make life much better and easier and cleaner so they can really afford everything and clothing to groceries to fuel and everyday life of course all the families will be able to afford so they would love America more and more and they'll fall in love with this country more and more and of course they will be ready to give their lives for this country because he wants to make America the best place on the planet Earth now also Trump humbly acknowledges that if he loses if he loses this election and Kamala Harris wins then he doesn't care like he doesn't have he doesn't have anything bad to say about in return but he doesn't care but the only thing he's focusing on that is all he cares about is he wants to do his job what he promises and of course I think so he will do his job because that will be his last four years in his entire life so he wants to make America powerful again and America clean again and America great again so now he got three things powerful great and clean so he'll be focusing on this very very immensely and I think so that he will succeed 100% now Trump promises to bring the entire energy prices down and he will be focusing only on one thing on the golden oil under the feet of Americans that's of course that's patrol so now of course now he's just keep on saying of course drill baby drill so that means of course all the energy price will come down and we'll be able to afford the gas and like for now at present times we are struggling not we the the people who are making less money and having a little bit bigger families they are struggling to fill up the gas tanks in their cars and of course and he says they it'll he will make it very easier for them so they will be able to afford gas and fill up the tanks and also groceries and all other sectors so in this video as I covered all the points this are the takeaway points from his rally what he really what he recently made in Pennsylvania so now and one thing I want to talk about in the I want to touch this that and I'm pretty sure Trump if he loses if he loses if he loses I know he doesn't care because he cannot do anything after that but if he wins trust me I think so he will make America great again because he will clean with criminals he will close the borders and he will make America powerful again clean again and America great again and he wants to make America the manufacturing powerhouse that means all the manufacturing will take place in America with off I'm talking about the American companies like Apple of course it will manufacture in America 100% he will try to do that but if he does that believe me that would be great but again let's see what and what cost these companies will agree and not agree also but the points what he just put down in front of the people they were really amazing and really attracting and let's see how many votes will really get and based on that we will see where America is heading thank you so much for watching and see in the next video don't forget to subscribe the channel so it'll help me to to make more and more videos and see you next time bye bye take care
