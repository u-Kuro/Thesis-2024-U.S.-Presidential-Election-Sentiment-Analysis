Remsha Pabloska said didn't stop women from running for president But there were obstacles I think for male politicians they can kind of just like have a vibe Whereas women politicians I think have to work really really hard to cultivate that vibe And M.J. said that vibe over the years despite their education and long resume Came in the form of pop culture I do think that women in politics especially women who are running for high profile elected positions Have had to engage popular culture in ways that seem to me to be gendered M.J. is talking about female presidential nominees who use popular music artists to motivate voters Like Hillary Clinton in 2016 with Katy Perry or Vice President Kamala Harris who brought Beyonce out for a campaign rally I've never heard of Beyonce coming to a presidential rally That's one of the biggest things that had me get up and come today M.J. said both Shirley Chisholm who was the first African American to run for president And Geraldine Ferraro the first woman nominated for vice president by a major political party Relied heavily on fashion to stay connected to pop culture Shirley Chisholm for example like a fashion star you know just this great bright colors bright prints like really mod 60s cuts That became for her a calling card Geraldine Ferraro wore a lot of pantsuits So when we think about Hillary Clinton in pantsuits actually that goes back to Geraldine Ferraro So even though women didn't have the right to vote for president until 1920 They continued to find new ways to connect to voters Paving away for more women to be a part of positive change in the nation's capital And taking a gorgeous look outside on your Halloween 62 degrees right now We're just talking about how nice it feels out there finally feeling like fall we love to see it especially on Halloween We do have 13 first alert meteorologist Mallory Schnell here with us look at us in our orange and purple you've got the Halloween earrings Trying to go for the little witchy vibe I also have a spider in my hair Oh cute well if I was gonna have a spider in my hair that's the one I would want Not a real spider in my hair I know isn't it funny with like spiders ah but then around Halloween It's like all their fake spiders everywhere They're so cute yeah they're probably like why don't we get this treatment you're brown Probably a little mad about it No it's okay Good news is in my house they die year round so that's the truth anyways weather wise Great weather honestly lots of sunshine today Temperature is pretty much right at climate normal so that will put Sierra Vista at 75 Tucson at 81 this afternoon so great weather pretty much all throughout the day including four trick-or-treating this evening So we're not looking to break any records today Hot as high and 93 set back in 1916 cold as low 29 degrees set back way in 1900 The rainiest day still under half of an inch of rainfall but of course we're not tracking any of that today Average temperature is 82 for a high 53 for a low and your trick-or-treat forecast here is sunset just after 5 30 this evening Temperatures should stay in the 70s and to some before dipping down into the 60s at some point during the 7 o'clock hour Mostly clear to partly cloudy fantastic fantastic weather for trick-or-treaters tonight your upper level pattern here We do have some big changes on the way though this weekend with our next weather system diving in here Saturday night into Sunday also taking us through Monday you can see all those blues there it moves out early next week Likely by Election Day but then we could have more active weather throughout next week may not bring rain every time But we'll definitely reinforce the cool air that we do have in place so chances of rain staying dry through Saturday Rain chances return Sunday with mountain snow chance as possible as well so keep an eye on that 40% of some lingering moisture Come Monday before we dry back out in the meantime lots of sunshine temperatures in the 50s and lower 60s this morning And we will continue to warm up nicely today so once again 81 into sun 49 tonight We stay in the 80s Friday and Saturday before we fall back into the 70s even some 60s possible by Monday with those rain chances moving in especially Sunday But looking dry for now for Election Day next Tuesday with a high of 73 overnight lows stay chilly in the 40s and 50s So very fall like as we head into November even some rain should be great so we love to see it Yeah, finally yeah nice weekend ahead of us.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,"['kamala', 'harris', 'kamala harris', 'vice president', 'vice', 'president', 'president kamala', 'men', 'voters', 'campaign']"
