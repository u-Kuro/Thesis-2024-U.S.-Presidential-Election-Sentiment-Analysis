So let's dive into this Trump endorsed Dr. Oz in the Senate race.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
"But Dr. Oz, first of all, I saw this yesterday.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"

"Interestingly enough, one of the reasons that Trump says he endorsed Oz, even though, as you point out, he's probably to use a MAGA word squishy on a couple of their issues, transgender issues being among them, is he thinks that Oz will do better in a general election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
Trump's argument is that Dr. Oz is who can win the general election.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
And it was that Dr. Oz that beat him out.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
I'm unclear what Oz really believes because he keeps changing his mind on a number of these issues.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
"And you raised a great point, Leland, about Dr. Oz and whether he really believes in the ideology of this.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"

They're the reason dr. Oz lost the Senate race.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
I think he's worse than Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
Like people are gonna be like even like my fellow Armenians are like I can't support Dr. Oz because he's Turkish or whatever.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
And this is where you are today with Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
"It quite literally if the Senate ends up 50 50 in favor of Democrats because of Kamala Harris is the tiebreaking vote, you could accurately blame Trump for losing Republicans, the Senate, by jumping in and endorsing Oz rather than McCormick or staying out of it altogether.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
"And honestly Oz may be the lesser of two evils between those two, but that's not enough in my opinion.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
Lots of attacks by the Oz campaign on Federman's health.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
"It's like we say, yeah, Oz and McCormick.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
Oz is better than McCormick in my view.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
And that's what Dr. Oz did.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
And I'm not entirely sure Dr. Oz does that and the guy's got a lot of controversial statements in his past surrounding a wide variety of things.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
And so it's hard to say because in some ways Dr. Oz is representative of Trumpism very sort of progressive on LGBT issues and then very.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
"On the other hand, Oz lost.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
"He is up against the Republican candidate, Dr. Oz.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
"So the point is that it's changing a lot and obviously it's very up for grabs, but Dr. Oz lost the state by almost six points back in 2022.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
So like Dr. Oz being a carpet bagger is actually part of this conversation too.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
"So I honestly, between those two, I would rather have Oz.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
The Trump in Dorsey campaigning with Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"

I think McCormick is more dangerous because Oz I see is more of a grifter.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
So he's going to go out there and endorse Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"

And that might be the pro of Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
And Dr. Oz is just an unproven product because who knows what he's been saying his entire career.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"

That's a fact for crying out loud Oz lost his vote by like 40 or 50 points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"

I think Oz is more of a grifter.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
"So like I said, Dr. Oz and McCormick both are awful.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"
It started to get really ugly because there are people in the Trump camp who are extremely dissatisfied with his decision to back Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz guy', 'oz trump', 'oz campaign', 'oz election', 'oz senate']"

Remsha Pabloska said didn't stop women from running for president But there were obstacles I think for male politicians they can kind of just like have a vibe Whereas women politicians I think have to work really really hard to cultivate that vibe And M.J. said that vibe over the years despite their education and long resume Came in the form of pop culture I do think that women in politics especially women who are running for high profile elected positions Have had to engage popular culture in ways that seem to me to be gendered M.J. is talking about female presidential nominees who use popular music artists to motivate voters Like Hillary Clinton in 2016 with Katy Perry or Vice President Kamala Harris who brought Beyonce out for a campaign rally I've never heard of Beyonce coming to a presidential rally That's one of the biggest things that had me get up and come today M.J. said both Shirley Chisholm who was the first African American to run for president And Geraldine Ferraro the first woman nominated for vice president by a major political party Relied heavily on fashion to stay connected to pop culture Shirley Chisholm for example like a fashion star you know just this great bright colors bright prints like really mod 60s cuts That became for her a calling card Geraldine Ferraro wore a lot of pantsuits So when we think about Hillary Clinton in pantsuits actually that goes back to Geraldine Ferraro So even though women didn't have the right to vote for president until 1920 They continued to find new ways to connect to voters Paving away for more women to be a part of positive change in the nation's capital And taking a gorgeous look outside on your Halloween 62 degrees right now We're just talking about how nice it feels out there finally feeling like fall we love to see it especially on Halloween We do have 13 first alert meteorologist Mallory Schnell here with us look at us in our orange and purple you've got the Halloween earrings Trying to go for the little witchy vibe I also have a spider in my hair Oh cute well if I was gonna have a spider in my hair that's the one I would want Not a real spider in my hair I know isn't it funny with like spiders ah but then around Halloween It's like all their fake spiders everywhere They're so cute yeah they're probably like why don't we get this treatment you're brown Probably a little mad about it No it's okay Good news is in my house they die year round so that's the truth anyways weather wise Great weather honestly lots of sunshine today Temperature is pretty much right at climate normal so that will put Sierra Vista at 75 Tucson at 81 this afternoon so great weather pretty much all throughout the day including four trick-or-treating this evening So we're not looking to break any records today Hot as high and 93 set back in 1916 cold as low 29 degrees set back way in 1900 The rainiest day still under half of an inch of rainfall but of course we're not tracking any of that today Average temperature is 82 for a high 53 for a low and your trick-or-treat forecast here is sunset just after 5 30 this evening Temperatures should stay in the 70s and to some before dipping down into the 60s at some point during the 7 o'clock hour Mostly clear to partly cloudy fantastic fantastic weather for trick-or-treaters tonight your upper level pattern here We do have some big changes on the way though this weekend with our next weather system diving in here Saturday night into Sunday also taking us through Monday you can see all those blues there it moves out early next week Likely by Election Day but then we could have more active weather throughout next week may not bring rain every time But we'll definitely reinforce the cool air that we do have in place so chances of rain staying dry through Saturday Rain chances return Sunday with mountain snow chance as possible as well so keep an eye on that 40% of some lingering moisture Come Monday before we dry back out in the meantime lots of sunshine temperatures in the 50s and lower 60s this morning And we will continue to warm up nicely today so once again 81 into sun 49 tonight We stay in the 80s Friday and Saturday before we fall back into the 70s even some 60s possible by Monday with those rain chances moving in especially Sunday But looking dry for now for Election Day next Tuesday with a high of 73 overnight lows stay chilly in the 40s and 50s So very fall like as we head into November even some rain should be great so we love to see it Yeah, finally yeah nice weekend ahead of us.",Donald Trump,Arizona,"['gender', 'gender gap', 'women', 'gap', 'men', 'women men', 'men women', 'women women', 'woman', 'men trump']"

yet look Michiganders in the eye and say I'm doing right by you as the top lawyer top cop in in Michigan she indicts and she indicts just the fake electors she doesn't make it a broader a broader conspiracy though she could have and brought in everybody else including Donald Trump and John Eastman of Rudy Giuliani and everybody else she didn't do that she focused uniquely on just her citizens her residents of Michigan and brought a count or so against each one of them and that's the way she can maintain her own case at the same time Jack Smith goes after Donald Trump and the others and the other states this could be a model for the other states we're seeing for instance in Arizona the Attorney General doing about the same thing she's just further behind she's not ready to indict she's developing her evidence but I expect now based on you know Dana Nessel breaking that glass ceiling of prosecutors state prosecutors others will do the same thing because they'll say it can be it can be plus it can be two it doesn't have to be well we have to wait to see what the feds do about our own criminals in our own midst we can do it too I think this is going to be a real blueprint and a

house of Michigan even the leadership in the state house the speaker of the house for Michigan right and also the majority leader for Michigan went in November 20th of that year to the White House to meet with Donald Trump and they came away and issued a press statement that said yeah yeah we met with the president but we didn't really see anything that indicates that this wasn't a fair election or that anything was unfair about Michigan or that its votes should go somewhere else well apparently 16 people that met in the basement of the GOP headquarters and you can't make this stuff up thought otherwise they thought there was a way to steal the election from Joe Biden and undercut the will of the people in their own state and hand deliver the the the presidency to the person that they wanted not the people that michigan michigan people wanted but even the leadership in the state house thought that was crazy uh but wasn't crazy enough for these people who are these people well let's just run it down Kathy Bearden age 70 Hank Chote 72 Amy Fachinello 55 Clifford Frost 75 Stanley Grot 71 John Haggard 82 Mary Ann Henry 65 Tim King 56 I'm reading out there their ages so you know these aren't children these people know better you know these are you know 50 60 70 and 80 year olds in in the state of Michigan Michelle Lundgren 73 Miss Shawn Maddock 55 James Renner 76 Myra

friends with its chairperson Rona McDaniel Mitt Romney's niece and Michelle Maddock former co-chair of the Michigan GOP you have been indicted by your attorney general and here here is the indictment everybody gets the same swag bag from the attorney general Nessel everybody gets that I just listed one count of conspiracy to commit forgery which is a 14 year possible felony two counts of forgery a 14 year felony one count of conspiracy to commit uttering and publishing usually means a false statement a 14 year felony one count of uttering and publishing a false statement another 14 year felony one count of conspiracy to commit election law forgery a five-year felony and two counts of election law forgery a five-year felony and the the attorney general's office we we've heard her statement at the top of this hot take of attorney general Nessel but they went on to say in a written press statement that the false electors actions undermine the public's faith in the integrity of our elections and we believe also plainly violated the laws by which we administer our elections in Michigan my department meaning the attorney general of Michigan's department has prosecuted numerous cases cases of election law violations throughout my tenure and it would be malfeasance for the greatest magnitude of the greatest magnitude if my department failed to act here in the face of overwhelming evidence of an organized effort to circumvent the lawfully cast ballots of millions of Michigan voters in a presidential election couldn't have said it any better than attorney general Nessel I don't think this is going to be the end I think this is the blueprint all attorney generals in the battleground states can use to both establish their own territory get their own piece of turf and real estate to go after their citizens involved in the fake electors and kind of stay away from this sprawling more conspiracy oriented set of charges and indictments brought by either Jack Smith which would include Donald Trump and or Fawny Willis the Fulton County DA who is also looking at places like Michigan and the as part of her conspiracy but this is a perfect thread the needle right this is putting a camel through the eye of the needle in the form of let's just go after our state's bad people alleged bad people and we'll do that and we'll stay away from Jack Smith's prosecution and we can live harmoniously side by side as parallel prosecutors and that's that's what attorney generals who are the top prosecutors for each state can do if you do it the way that
