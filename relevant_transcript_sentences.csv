And Harris rose to the top of the ticket.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
Harris has been anything but clear.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"

But were Harris to lose in November?,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
The Harris team is flip-flopping.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
So it's kind of pushed those folks over to Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
They're both in good shape.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
"Anyway, Harris is going there today.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
Harris offered it to him Tuesday morning as campaign cameras rolled.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"

"Because if he does, mathematically speaking, Harris at above 270.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"

And Harris currently holds a razor thin lead here.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
This is not a huge lead for Harris whatsoever.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
All they found was Harris right now at the same time period.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"

I don't think that's good news for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
Harris is more positive.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
Harris is proving to be a formidable opponent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
Harris is not really able to stop the bleeding.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"

The Harris team is lying.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
But here is Harris with a decidedly different rhetorical approach to this age old question that we get from the Beltway Press.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
If Harris wins it.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
I need to pretend like Harris has got this sort of stuff.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
And it does seem as if Harris is in a much weaker position than these individuals.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"

But that still has now shifted in favor of Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
Many would like to see helping Harris is not there.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
The Harris team is calling this the New Way Forward Tour.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
The problems just keep adding up for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
So there's Harris on the one hand.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
And Harris was terrible on Fox News the other night.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
They're not going to break for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
"But you rather Trump than Harris, huh?",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"

Now it's basically tied Harris with a small margin there.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
Harris would enforce the law.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
The Harris team has not committed to that yet.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
But we're also seeing Harris trying to reach people in various ways.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
And that's the biggest problem for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
"On the pathway to 270, Harris is 226.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"

But Harris has not performed.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
"And for Harris, that's a complete disaster.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
Harris is underperforming with them.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris team', 'team', 'harris harris', 'team harris', 'harris', 'harris sort', 'shape harris', 'pathway harris', 'problem harris', 'surge harris']"
