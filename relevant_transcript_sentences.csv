Sentence,Presidential_Candidate,State
Michigan's only boomerang county that backed Obama then Trump then Biden.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Okay, then what happened: and then I just felt like he did a good job.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I like the fact that he was not a politician.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"No, I'm not so sure, retiree John Brady is backing Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She reflects more of what I see.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Both friends are backing Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't like him as a person.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But I think he's the best thing for the country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
How will you feel if Trump doesn't win: petrified.,Donald Trump,Michigan
You see Obama won Eaton County twice so did Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But Trump's 2020 margin was less than 1 percent and when I say less than 1 percent I mean 499 votes.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Retired nurse Paul Mudri is a Reagan Democrat who backs Vice President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Sloan Davis is part of the Harris coalition but half-heartedly.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I know Trump went down some very seemingly ridiculous rabbit holes about cats and everything else.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But that doesn't mean they don't still care about immigration and will not still continue to back Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He quickly solidified his position as the front-runner, consistently garnering strong support among Republican voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Under immense pressure from prominent Democrats fearing a loss, Biden decided to withdraw from the race, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump remains a strong force within his party, and the 538 forecast as of this morning shows him ahead with a 53-47 edge.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Despite not having overwhelmingly positive favorability ratings, her stance on these key issues is helping her win over voters who may have reservations about her candidacy, but are still aligning with her on policy grounds.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"While much of the media has painted a narrative favoring Donald Trump as the front-runner, recent high-quality polls tell a more nuanced story.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In Michigan and Pennsylvania, Harris has a two-point edge in each, both of which are critical to either candidate's path to victory.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
One of the key factors driving Harris's performance is her overwhelming support among young women.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Additionally, Harris is performing well on issues like health care and abortion.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If she can maintain these leads, they could form a key part of her electoral firewall.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris had maintained a lead here throughout much of the campaign, but the latest data shows that the state has tightened.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Donald Trump said the tariff hikes on the income tax cuts as better to support manufacturing.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Rather than any political considerations, running in 2016, Trump narrowly won Michigan as a whole.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You can see on the basis of this result, Kamala Harris narrowly wins, but literally she's on the nose.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's on 270, and there's a particular peculiarity about this scenario, which is you can see here, this is the state of Nebraska.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And today we are gonna be talking about the battleground state of Michigan getting a whole new set of new polls out of the state showing Kamala Harris expanding from where she was before of a minor lead across the state.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Now to the most recent poll from Michigan State University showing Kamala Harris with roughly a 4.6% 4.7% lead across the battleground state.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That showed Michigan in a position where Kamala Harris held a two point lead against the former president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And like I said, Emerson College, not Emerson College, Bloomberg and Morning Consult, the Michigan State University poll, some other data points too that we've been seeing, Quinnipiac University just released a data point just a few days ago, showing Kamala Harris with a 3-point lead in the state of Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And so to set the scene for what it means in Michigan does go blue, it makes the pathway forward for Donald Trump a bit trickier as to how he wins the election.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And granted, the numbers in Michigan don't always translate to amazing numbers for Kamala Harris in states like Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But a tied result is better than what again, the Republican Party and the mainstream press has been pushing is that Donald Trump is winning every battleground state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"241 to 219 means that Kamala Harris also has additional pathways to the presidency because Michigan has given her 15 electoral votes that boosts her forward, right: boost her to 241.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's no longer at that number, 226, which is where she was before, 241 from 226.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
That's good for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
It gives her options as to how she reaches the magic number of 270 electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And so you can see Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and Michigan would be enough to put Kamala Harris over 270, which means even if she loses Florida, Texas, Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania would really be a shocker here.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Because also too, what we saw was that the Donald Trump team started pulling some ad funding from the state of Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Now I'm not gonna say they're giving up Michigan by any means.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump will be in Michigan over the next two weeks, they'll be investing heavily into the state of Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But I think that also speaks to the range at which we could see Harris win by one, two, three points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Doesn't mean she would be guaranteed to win it, the answer is absolutely not.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Michigan was a complete crap show for Joe Biden when he was running against Trump down 2.1%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And the last poll that was conducted was the Detroit Free Press that showed Donald Trump with a seven point lead across the state of massive, massive improvement for the former president in the state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Although Rookler Politics has Donald Trump up in the average, they have yet to consider the Michigan State University poll.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I mean, all these different things, Quinnipiac, Michigan State University, TLDR, the numbers are getting better for Kamala Harris in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
No guarantee that she wins Michigan at this point.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's obviously more likely than not, but I will say this, Michigan has been a tricky one for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But as of right now, the numbers are telling us that Kamala Harris is doing a lot better in Michigan than she was before.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And some very reputable sources as they enter into the final stages of polling and understanding the race are saying Kamala Harris is starting to win back support.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If there was ever a time for Kamala Harris to turn around a race, turn around some of these battlegrounds, that time would be now.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And the question remains, will Michigan hold blue as the polls are predicting, will it be a 2016 type of error where they end up going to Donald Trump, despite the preliminary data suggesting otherwise: so thank you guys so much for watching this video.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And President Trump can say whatever he wants, but we've seen his record that has been disastrous for the auto industry.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Today we have a really important one for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"With me, CNN's senior data reporter, professor of numbers, Harry Ettin, when we talk about Donald Trump from the beginning of Donald Trump as a political figure, non-college white voters, white voters who did not go to college, have been one of his key demographics.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It's been a key demographic for him.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It's been his base.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So you would think his core group, his base of support would be doing the same.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So this is Trump's march with non-college white voters.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's actually moving slightly away, so you go back eight years ago, he won him by 33.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You go back four years ago, he won him by 31.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Shrinkage, as Donald Trump might say, based on what he said the last few days.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"All other groups, voters of color at 28 percent, so this is something that we've seen throughout the board, right: which is that Donald Trump is making huge gains with groups that make up a smaller percentage of the electorate while he's losing a little bit.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But these groups that he's losing a little bit of make up a much larger portion of the electorate.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump won him by 25.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump winning him by 22.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Again, Trump is ahead, but his margins are smaller.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And when you have a shrinking margin for Donald Trump among his core group that makes up the majority of voters, it can make up for big shifts among smaller groups of the electorate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's because even though she's losing big league, she's losing big league among groups that make up a small portion of the electorate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And she's making it up among groups that make up a big portion of the electorate, even if the movements are small.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And if I can, yes, please, again, you know, as you're looking here, again, this is where Donald Trump has seen gains.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Everyone, let's thank President Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Was Donald Trump's 39 minute spontaneous dance party the closest we are getting to an October surprise: as both campaigns enter the home stretch, there will be no big final debate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's nearly 80 years old.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's out there rambling, moving around, we'll give him a break.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But look, he's not up to this anymore, folks.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's not up to it.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Quote, Trump suddenly seems not just lazy, weak by dodging another debate, for instance, and old, but also truly out of it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, he's still Trump, but he's you know, he's hanging out with McDonald's with real people, talking about stuff that real people like that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And this is the reason why I think Kamala Harris is going to win.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"When when when it's all about turnout, what's key is enthusiasm, right, you know, whose voters are more excited about going out to vote: and Harris has like a 10 point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She also has about a 10 point advantage on women voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So I see a lot of signs that polling is not picking up their advantages for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I think that she's going to win.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So just sort of counter to my own narrative, there's a reality out there that there are huge numbers of young men turning out for Trump and these Charlie Kirk campus rallies.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So this conventional wisdom that on college campuses is all women and they're all voting for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"They don't normally turn out, and I just don't think if they if they're not excited about Donald Trump before I don't know why they would be now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I think that's where Harris is going.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Again I take your point that you think Harris is on track to win here.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And that's exactly what the Harris campaign is doing.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I think that Donald Trump would be a total disaster for our nation, and I cannot vote for him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So what's at stake for women if Donald Trump is our president: i think it's bad news for women.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And so we're going to take a look at what counties my favorite Harris over Trump.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And if we go back to 2020, we see that Trump won that county 66%, total votes 85,123.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And if we go back to 2020, Trump won this county 69% and total votes 99,585.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If we go back to 2020, we see that Trump won that county by 71%, total votes 64,183.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If we go back to 2020, we see that Trump won that county by 56%, total number there, 41,540.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And if we go back to 2020, we see that Trump won by 67%, with a total number of 51,501 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If we go back to 2020, we see that Trump won that county by 53%, and total votes 37,956.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If we go back to 2020, we see that Trump won that county by 62%, total votes 50,013.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that's probably going to help Harris, okay, I want to show you the electoral map.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
But let's just say that it goes for Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And if you look at 538, their polling average, Harris has a slight advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She'll have 276, so that's something else that we're looking at.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There's a wave, a Democratic wave going across the country as she's going around with all these events here.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Is it possible to keep this momentum going, what does she need to do to keep the momentum between now and November: i think that she keeps doing what she's doing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think that she's got a ton of momentum.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"People are excited, her message of hope and positiveness and what's right about the country is connecting with people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And Donald Trump's message about faith, family, and freedom, growing our economy, securing our borders, addressing skyrocketing inflation, these are the messages that are resounding with voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It's pretty hard to argue his record isn't one and one.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And again, no matter your politics, it's hard to have watched that and not to clear Harris the winner, at least poll after poll continues to show.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Vance and Trump will let Michigan manufacturing's plants close, just like Trump did.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They're gonna send us backwards.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"We can't go back, going back means cutting $500 million from the Lansing Grand River plant.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Don't let Trump and Vance throw it away.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Four years ago when Republican Mike Rogers said this about Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I think yesterday broke the spell that so many people had about Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Clearly his actions led to that, you know, what we, there's no great way to describe what happened yesterday, sedition.",Donald Trump,Michigan
You even said that he was clearly responsible for the acts of January 6th.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Do you stand by any of those: well I didn't say he was clearly responsible, but here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But do you stand by any of the criticism that you had after 2020: even Donald Trump said I was tough, but fair.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Look at the issues, i wouldn't line up with Kamala Harris on anything, rogers is now trying to tie Vice President Kamala Harris to Slodkin.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She voted 100 percent with the Biden-Harris agenda.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But even as Slodkin has backed the Biden-Harris agenda and campaigned with the VP, When the vice president comes, you go.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But the truth is, I can have those conversations with Kamala Harris when we disagree.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Mike Rogers can't disagree with Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"As Trump was in Detroit earlier this month, he leveled this insult.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now what he was talking about is there are schools that are failing, and the Democrats every year keep saying, I'm going to help you.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Kamala Harris became the nominee, Adam was initially hopeful.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, we hear a lot of talks about a ceasefire, but Kamala Harris and everybody, they say, you know, we want a ceasefire, but, and then what we want to see is a permanent ceasefire.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The week we traveled to Dearborn, the city was hosting ArabCon.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now, a recent national poll puts Kamala Harris' support with the Muslim community at 30%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, the Arab and Muslim community knows very well what a Trump presidency looks like.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He is a threat to our country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's a threat to our democracy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So we also need to talk about Kamala Harris being a threat to our democracy and the Democratic Party being a threat to our democracy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I think he's not just a disaster for Arab-Americans, but he's also a disaster for all Americans.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Ali's family history is deeply tied to Michigan's labor unions, which are known for having a significant influence on the outcome of elections.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And at the same time, I think Donald Trump would be disastrous for our country.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Harris does not move as it relates to policy, I cannot come out and endorse Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But as more and more Arab and Muslim voters stop being loyal to the Democratic Party, it could make Kamala Harris's path to the White House extremely difficult.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
You saw Donald Trump once tonight.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He only decided to take this job once he found out Trump was going to be president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But Biden is old, trump is old, four years younger.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But you think they should support Trump more than they even have.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yes, sir, okay, and Del, final question for you, independent for Trump also, independent, yeah, for Trump, you supported Trump though.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But either way, you're a Trump supporter.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But now six of those eight forecasts show Trump slightly favored to win.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So how big of a problem does Harris have with young men: she has one.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Another demographic that Harris seems to have some issues with is Arab American voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She is doing better amongst women.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"How much of this is about winning over Trump supporters: you could vote for Trump, but also vote for a Democrat at the Senate level.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, look, relatively speaking, she is a newer candidate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's only recently, a couple of weeks, she started to do interviews.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And you know, Donald Trump, he's been essentially running for president for 10 years.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She's not talking about the economy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's not talking about the border.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"January 6th stuff, that's where she pulls better.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So she's at least going to close on the two issues that voters trust her and think she's best able to handle.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So I want to move our direction to Harris's campaign schedule this week.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's also going to be campaigning with Beyonce herself, a Houston native.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
He Allred and Harris have focused heavily on abortion.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So it looks like Trump will have the best performance with black voters since 1960.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Right now, Trump might get 50%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's right now pulling at close to 50% of the Hispanic vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Despite the fact that media, the media business continuously trying to call him his anti-Hispanic, right: that's all they do.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He hates immigrants.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He hates Hispanics.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that's why he might win close to 50% of the Hispanic vote, okay: this is not going well for them.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But right now, it is possible that Trump is gonna win 25% of the black vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"How do we know that: because she's going on, she's going to the Death Star.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's going on to Fox News for an interview.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She is so desperate that she is, look, she can't handle friendly interviews, Rita.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"How is she gonna handle Bret Baier: and Bret Baier, by the way, is not an attack dog.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And she's not gonna handle that, she can't handle the view, Rita.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What is she gonna do: look, the polling is all trending away from her.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
They push this notion that maybe Trump is like this bad guy and stuff.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And he could very well just be like a bad guy, but I'd be lying if, you know, like numbers don't lie.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's done a lot for, you know, like us, you know, under his administration.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They're old enough to remember what it was like under Trump and compare it to what their life is like today under Joe Biden.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I think Trump's gonna win this election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I don't see this turning around anytime soon, unless there's some kind of massive mistake that he makes, which is always possible.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think Trump's gonna win.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump, defying all expectations and predictions, managed to flip them red, securing a crucial victory.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"For Kamala Harris, these states represent both a formidable challenge and a significant opportunity to connect with voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"To secure the presidency, she'll need to win back voters who felt left behind by the Democratic Party's previous strategies and policies.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But beyond that, she'll also need to energize a base that is still reeling from the shock of 2016, reigniting their passion and commitment.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump's presidency, marked by controversy and division, has left the country deeply polarized.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"His supporters see him as a disruptor, a fighter for the forgotten man.",Donald Trump,Michigan
His detractors view him as a threat to democratic norms and institutions.,Donald Trump,Michigan
She must unite a fractured Democratic Party while also appealing to independents and disaffected Republicans.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
The outcome in Michigan and Wisconsin could very well hinge on her ability to do just that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump's rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin are a familiar sight.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris faces an uphill battle in Michigan and Wisconsin.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She needs to convince voters that she understands their concerns and has a plan to address them.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She needs to articulate a clear vision for the future that resonates with their hopes and aspirations.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
One of her biggest challenges is overcoming the perception that she is a creature of the coastal elite.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She needs to connect with Midwestern voters on a personal level, showing them that she understands their values and shares their priorities.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She needs to convince them that she's not just another politician making empty promises.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She needs to show them that she's a leader who will fight for them, someone who will listen to their concerns and work to improve their lives.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Many Republicans are appalled by his behavior, his policies, and his rhetoric.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Republican voters are increasingly expressing their concerns about Trump's leadership.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"This discontent is a powerful force, and it has the potential to swing the election against Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If enough Republicans in key states like Michigan and Wisconsin decide to vote for Harris, it could be enough to tip the scales in her favor.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
This has led some to believe that Haley is tacitly encouraging her supporters to back Harris as a way to move the Republican Party away from Trumpism.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
The extent to which Haley's supporters will ultimately back Harris is unclear.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Section 11, the Long Game The 2024 election is more than just a referendum on Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It's a battle for the future of the Republican Party.,Donald Trump,Michigan
They believe that Trump's brand of politics is unsustainable and ultimately damaging to the party's long-term prospects.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Trump wins, it will embolden his wing of the party.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump lost the electoral college by an aggregate of somewhere between 45 and 60,000 votes last time.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"How critical is winning the state of Michigan to both of these candidates and their quest for 270 electoral votes: i mean, Gio, this is critical for Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
He was able to flip some of those states red.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The map gets so much harder, if not nearly impossible, for Harris if she loses Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's why, of course, she is spending so much time there.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
A big day for her appearing for the first time alongside former First Lady Michelle Obama.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Look, I'm not sure that this is Trump necessarily going hugely outside of his base.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, of course, she's up with women by 10 points, but that gender gap is so apparent here.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It was a very interesting, very long interview with Joe Rogan, meandering at times, nearly three hours, talked about everything from life on Mars to mixed martial arts fighters, but also Trump repeating and getting pushed by Rogan on some of his election conspiracies and false claims about election security, Gio.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And that's a big part of her closing argument.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"These last 10 days, she needs to both talk about former President Trump, but also talk about herself and what she wants to get done.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But on the other hand, she's making a direct appeal to independents, to sort of soft Republicans who aren't excited to vote for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This implies that regardless of the election results, the 2024 election will be Trump's last.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"47.6% to 47.2%, given the electoral college does structurally favour Republicans, this national lead would almost certainly not be enough for Harris to win 270 electoral votes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The latest polling average via DDHQ has Harris up 1.8%, based on 13 polls, 49.2% to 47.4%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Kamala Harris 43.5% of the undecideds at 5% of the vote, robert Kennedy of course his name is still going to as you know appear on the ballot even though he is not running.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump and his Madison Square Garden rally where the ugly comments are still reverberating.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris last night where she pledged to unify a divided country.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Joe Biden won all three during the last election when he defeated Trump and entered the Oval Office.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Any other just worried that under a Harris administration, it's going to continue.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And we've got we're doing really, you know, for Republicans, Donald Trump is doing pretty well with the black vote across the state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And it's there's only one way for her to go.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And that's down, and I think Donald Trump is going to benefit from that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I think they see Donald Trump Trump fighting for their jobs.,Donald Trump,Michigan
We're going to carry Michigan for Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
We're going to carry the top of the ticket with Trump and with Mike Rogers.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"You've got to get the states that get you to 270 So I've got to change this back and now I can change it back to Harris So if she wins, Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania There she is at 270 and she is done what has been done so many times before and that's when that blue wall That goes right through Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris stopped by cred cafe on the east side, which hosted a watch party for a radio town hall that aired from Detroit with harris and host charlotte main the god.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"After the show, harris met with voters like retired Detroit school teacher Justine Trevick.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris also made a stop at Norwest Art Gallery, a locally owned business on the northwest side.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
President Trump has listened to black men and delivered real results.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I really don't, i think they know that Kamala is for the people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
One Michigan senator has thrown his support behind current Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Our Al Myers caught up with the senator in Lansing today and brings us the latest on why he's excited to support Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
It didn't take long for Michigan Senator Gary Peters to throw his endorsement behind current Vice President Kamala Harris after President Biden stepped away from the presidential race.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I know that Vice President Harris is going to have a choice of a lot of qualified individuals.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Peters told reporters after a Senate field hearing in Lansing that he quickly endorsed Harris for the nomination and noted just how quick he thinks the running mate selection will be.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There very well could be other names that are just not being talked about, but I know that Vice President Harris is going to have a choice of a lot of qualified individuals.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And when Kamala Harris was endorsed by the President and everybody across the party, all across the country, stepped up to say now let's come together and be unified with her, I think it bodes very well for the future.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I don't remember anything about Donald Trump prior to his political candidacy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
My feelings were mostly anxiety about the potential of Donald Trump being elected.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It was a put a lot on Trump, but it wasn't even like his fault.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump started Project Warp Speed, but then once he left office and Biden was there and pushing out the vaccine, all of a sudden the vaccine was being railed against by people that were former Trump allies.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I know Trump will leave it up to the states, which I think is fine.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris is the best option we have right now.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's restored a bit of that faith that democracy will win.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I know Kamala is more like women's rights.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
There has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our Republic than Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump won.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The latest, Kerry Lake, trump won, you're right.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Michigan Congressman Peter Meyer voted to impeach Trump after the capital attack this week.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He lost to a Trump back challenger.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But there is a lot of efforts being taken sort of below Donald Trump at the actual sort of state party level and sort of the campaign machinery is really trying to promote it.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Politico reports part of the reason could be gains Trump has made with black men.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"One man said his friends described Trump as funny, entertaining, brave.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He said he's impressed by Trump's business experience.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It's not that black men are significantly shifting to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So, Brendan Harris, on her part, has faced criticism and a lot of handwriting from Democrats, first for not doing enough interviews and then for not doing enough rallies.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"NBC reports, Harris appears to be okay with the collective jitters, recognizing that if Democrats fear they might lose, they're more apt to show up at the polls and help her win.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Do you agree with that, i mean, 17 days out, how do you see Harris's chances as of today, right now: i mean, it's a complete coin flip at this point, but I do think that fear of losing is a very good motivator.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She needs to find some way to recapture the momentum.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Maybe the way to do that is to make sure that people understand the stakes, that there's a very real chance that Donald Trump is president again very soon.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris has not been the Democratic nominee officially for a very long time.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So, she was being strategic with the calendar she was given.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Yeah, and Brandon Harris is also rallying with to Amisha's point, former President Obama next week.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
He's got another event tonight.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
How critical do you see both Obamas as being on the trail for Harris: because she's just trying to energize that coalition.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Are they the ones to do it for her: yeah.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I think she's done that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And of course, Barack Obama is pretty good at lobbying insults at Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It turns out, like everything he says, this is totally false.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Hat tip to Channel 6 News, WLNS, some great local reporting, they got their hands on footage of the moment Donald Trump was driving up to this venue where he gave this unhinged and very bizarre speech.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And guess what: there were not thousands and thousands of people as far as the eye can see as he was driving up.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So surprise, surprise, he's lying.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, so what Donald Trump does at all of these, all of these events, he always lies about the crowd sizes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And there's quite literally nobody there, he'll leave one of the buildings that he has his name on and he'll wave.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Meanwhile, Donald Trump gives himself fake AI endorsements of Swifties and Taylor Swift.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We're not endorsing him and Donald Trump continues to do stunts like that.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, and look all Donald Trump does his lie and lie about crowd sizes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump is not losing sleep over that question.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Here's a 78 year old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he wrote down his golden escalator nine years ago.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It has been a constant stream of gripes and grievances that that's actually been getting worse now that he's afraid of losing the common.,Donald Trump,Michigan
This is what he said on Friday.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Play this clip, and they say he had a hundred thousand people.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He claimed there were 25,000 people.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And actually at that event, Donald Trump had a rapper named Sleepy Hollow talking.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump was bragging about the guy's grill.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And this is how Trump was showing that he was having black support.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Here's Donald Trump praising the grill of Sleepy Hollow.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But over and over again, this is what Trump does, you know, he'll go into a black church, fill it with white MAGA supporters and claim he's speaking at a black church.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, he's always just bragging about these crowd sizes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that's what's really getting under Donald Trump's skin right now is that, you know, she's filling up stadiums that are bigger than his.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So he's going into these small venues and these really small kind of towns like Potterville.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And then he's saying, oh, you don't even see the people.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Here's what he talked about, billions of dollars, you know, somebody said, what do you think he lost: i said, probably two, three billion.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And, you know, if you want to see who these Trump supporters are, I mean, they're out there holding sperm cups of JD vans.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They're trying to say that JD vans, this is like the Trump and JD van supporters saying how fertile he is by holding family kit cups and as part of their opposition to IVF.",Donald Trump,Michigan
You've got these Trump supporters who are out there wearing diapers and saying diapers over Dems.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"They're wearing shirts that say, I'm with the convicted felon.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Here's another look over here, talking about these seven battleground states what we want to do today is kind of take the logic because everything's so close right, we want to take the logic and flip it on its head turn it 180 degrees around all right: upper Midwest these states here right the blue wall Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania that's where Kamala Harris wants to turn the trick to get to 270.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
What would happen now on this number from 219 compared to her 225: that would take him to 229.,Donald Trump,Michigan
For the sake of this exercise today we'll give him Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
What would happen then if Kamala Harris wins in Georgia and uses the same argument in North Carolina places like Greensboro and Raleigh maybe even Charlotte maybe they're bluer than we think.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
If that's if their boat is rising then Trump's boat must be rising as well.,Donald Trump,Michigan
That's as some Republicans pushed back on her visit.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"On Labor Day, Vice President and Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris traveling to Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What makes America great is our, part of it is our economy and the Harris administration is coming after auto workers jobs.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I mean, you know, we saw January 6th, we saw, you know, Trump just gradually eroding things away over the course of his term.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And now he's admitting it flat out.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Why are you voting for Donald Trump: it really just boils down to policy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't think that we'd have the situation Ukraine that we have right now if Trump was president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I think that Joe Biden could could muscle out a lot of votes by just standing on the Donald Trump's going to take away abortion.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"How does that make sense, how does that make sense to the average American that is working and trying to earn a living for their family: so for us like economically it makes absolutely no sense why we would continue the same path for these four years It's big news that Trump has united the Muslims and the Jews the Arabs are behind him big time It has to do with the war and the fact that she doesn't know what the hell she's doing and hasn't accomplished anything And the Democrat family values are just crazy The ultra woke Democrat ideology.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They don't know blacks don't understand it Black people migrated to Detroit and to Cleveland and to Indiana for factory work You know that from the south Factories has always been unemployment for us So especially the automotive factory This is how most of us got down here to Detroit coming for the automotive job When Trump renegotiated NAFTA in 2016 May that made it with production went from 63% to 75% That's 13% increase in production over here For people that's 13% employment over here There's millions of jobs for people over here So when people talk about what policies we know directly what policies that we support And we ain't no political clowns that we just jumping out supporting the can I have never openly supported: trump is the first open candidate that I ever openly supported people run for council here mayor here They can't get my support period He the first one of the first open candidates that I will ever support I don't just support political candidates My vote means something my voice means something Most of us myself included 80% of black men grow up in a household that's headed by a single female We grow up with the idea of a certain type of leadership And then when we come out of the house and we go to work We find out that the leadership that we learned from our single mama Doesn't work in the general public It just does not So we're frustrated and we don't really know what to do with our frustration people You know, we're doing one of these we don't know who to blame and and there's a lot of confusion Like I said, I'm 63 So I've gone through that stage and I figured it out and I think that when we see president trump out there We see a strong man See now when you grow up in a single mother house, so There's no real focus on what though what that energy is or what that energy officially looks like You don't really know but but when most of us see it we we go.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He care about detroit care about blacks.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He got his ways.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Like I said, but he's a good person at my eyes at least We drove around detroit for two days just kind of crisscross through Kind of poor beat up and middle class neighborhoods Trying to get a bunch of different people to talk to us And the people that said they were voting for kamala.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, okay Yeah, all right So how do you think things are going right now for you personally, good bad average I say average And you think he would make your life worse, i don't think he'd make it worse, but I don't think he would help and you think she would make your life better I'll be honest I don't know Because like I said, we never had a woman president before so being if being that be the first time I think it would be something different But I mean her views and her outlook on The United States is something different for us right now But I heard a lot of black men is not voting so that's going to take away from Kamala Harris Because if a lot of black men is not voting for her then she might not win Why are black men not voting for her: i don't know That's what everybody's talking about.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"We're sick of it Everybody hates them now and that's huge too because 20 of the detroit suburb of troy is indian american So you're an indian american Kamala harris is an indian american you're not supporting her Indian americans are not majority of them are not considering she's from the community, but she don't consider anyway.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She she Depending on the what day you're asking she might say if you if it's a monday She might say i'm a black if it's a tuesday.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
What did she do: nothing and she wants to start helping the day one.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That was a bad move She thinks they think she gonna help but honestly she not gonna help what it is Bring it like a memories.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
He gets destroyed because that is a lie What happened to Cheney she not gonna help was anything Traditionally traditionally Indian Americans used to vote for Democrats this election cycle.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
We are supporting Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
They don't want to come out there I'll tell you why media did a wonderful job of making showing Trump as a villain and That's what majority of the people they fed up with it But they don't want to come out because they're afraid of being attacked and that's what the situation so I don't believe hopes I can tell you right now.,Donald Trump,Michigan
We have a chance with Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So how does that make any sense: so that's why there's gonna be a tremendous amount of support Regardless of the fear tactics that the other side uses there's going to be a tremendous amount of support for Donald Trump And we're gonna bring him back to the White House inshaAllah.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Maybe we've converted Maybe he's gonna go vote and he's gonna go vote for Trump and Michigan's gonna win by one vote and it's gonna be that one guy and we're gonna have to find him We're gonna have to track him down and give him a big metal.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But with resentment swelling over the White House's support for Israel in its conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah, Dearborn voters are using their influence to threaten Vice President Kamala Harris' bid by withholding their votes or backing another candidate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
This is the reason why I support and I endorse President Trump because we're going to stop the wars.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump created an environment that was not good for us.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I'm committed for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The majority of this community, over Donald Trump, somebody say hello and give a good one.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But it is really crazy that Michigan officially leads for Trump by a point five margin in the average.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But in Wisconsin they did a Trump plus two and Michigan they did a Trump plus three.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Georgia Ty, Michigan Trump plus three which is very odd.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So if all of that is real, which I don't think any of it's really realistic, but if the races are that close that means more of a Trump lead than anything because Trump is always under polled.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Michigan is very odd as well, but I mean Quinnipiac did come out with a Trump plus three.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He leads point two.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He has Michigan if you see Michigan and then you look at Wisconsin here.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Now he needs one of these states.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Let's just say he wins Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He wins the election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Let's say he wins Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He doesn't win the election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
If he just wins one of these three states and if he's leading in two of those states which remember Michigan is the more left leaning state out of them.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So if he's leading in a state like Michigan over Wisconsin then Trump's just going to sweep every single one of these states and have a 3 0 6 2 3 3 which technically this is my prediction from my prediction video.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"You never know, trump could have a landslide victory if everything gets put into place.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I believe he also gets close to winning the popular vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I'm not sure if he'd won the popular vote but it's possible.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So but then based on like margins of like error and like Trump underperforming I mean overperforming polls you have kind of like this scenario.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Now do you think they'll overperform for Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Like he's expecting to like win Pennsylvania Michigan Wisconsin in this scenario like based on all the errors and also the the under polling by him.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I mean Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He it's almost the election time and he already almost has he already has a lead.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
But he's really been closing the gap since Harris withdrew.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So it's just it just shows that Trump is making gains.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But I bet it is still crazy to think that Trump is in the lead in a state like Michigan Michigan a state that just votes almost straight liberal.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But just to tell you guys I just want to show you like the gains Trump's been making Michigan actually leading for Trump in the actual average.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump has a rally in Detroit just about a block away from here.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know you talked about mobilization just a moment ago, but in terms of like politics of issues, is there anything, and let's talk about both candidates starting with Trump, that they have to really nail in terms of the Michigan voters: this has been an absolute consistency in this campaign.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris on the other hand is focusing on abortion.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There was a string of Democratic presidential victories here in Michigan between 1992, right until 2016 when Trump flipped it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And of course, Trump comes here and it crumbles across the Midwest, actually.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And what about Kamala Harris, what's the key thing she needs to convince Michiganders to do: to turn out and vote.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He has come to Michigan and talked quite a bit about electric vehicles, electrification in general.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Mayor, share with us what it means to have vice president and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris here in technically Lansing, but Lansing to speak to workers at New York.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Well, there we go, speaking of Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They say to you, hey, my financial situation under former President Donald Trump a few years ago was better than it is now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
What do you say to them: i start by reminding them that the economy that President Trump inherited was actually Barack Obama's economy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he shepherded that economy right into a crisis.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And you've got to remember Kamala Harris has been a candidate for president of the United States for about 92 days.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I'm certain that they are out there, but the conversations we are having is that if you want Alyssa Slocan to be the kind of senator who brings home the work for Michigan, we've got to have a White House as well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When you're talking to those voters, what do you say to that constituency: we talk a lot about the truth of who Donald Trump is.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think the conversations need to continue about how a Harris administration would handle the economy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's really interesting that you're saying, you have to remind people of who Kamala Harris is.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"We're just, our job is to be on the ground, on the doors, on the phones, at events, everywhere we can be, where voters will be to remind them of the importance of this election and the importance of their vote and the need to vote for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump's slim lead indicates Michigan is just as tightly contested as Georgia, with both candidates fiercely competing for voter support.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This poll reveals a shift, as Harris gains a slight advantage, showing how fluid Michigan's voter base can be.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"With Harris slightly ahead, Michigan remains a battleground that could shift either way.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And obviously, I really don't think that Trump is going to protect people who are part of the LGBT community, especially those who are trans.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Did he actually say that: i don't know.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He didn't exactly say that, corporations have been gouging.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Do you think Trump doesn't want women to vote: i'm not saying Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's the leader who's getting them in.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So what does he know, are you two: yeah.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, there's some things that need to be changed, but Kamala's going to do that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's going to make the changes.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And anybody but a felon, anybody what: but a felon, but a felon: okay, anybody but Trump, what do you hate about Trump the most: his rhetoric.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's nasty, he's, he's degrading.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's a very hateful man.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he's going to ruin our country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He already has divided our country with his first term.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And I'm also really excited to be out here supporting Kamala Harris for president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So that's really important to me, and obviously I really don't think that Trump is going to protect people who are part of the LGBT community, especially those who are trans.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think that's definitely one of the top things that she should do when she gets elected.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What did he lie about, what has he lied about: it's the simpler question to answer, and that's maybe his name and his age, and that's about it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
What do you think Kamala should do first if she gets elected: she'll know what to do.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She didn't even really have a good answer.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Her answer was not good, basically, she just uses the talking points of the same talking points that everybody else has, which is she's a liar, and I don't like it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And then you ask them, well, what's going on with the country, how's it going, well, not very good, but, well, then why are you voting and what's her name: look at all these people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"All right, trying to find some Trump people out here protesting, but I don't think that's going to happen.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala is going to save us.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Okay, you go Kamala and Waltz.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I agree, and she's got to win.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's got to win for our country.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I'm worried about it even when she wins.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He ran on a lot of resentment, like you said, false information.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I just feel Kamala just has that spark that we need as a country to bring everybody together.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So it's more she's good, not as much.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He's bad because a lot of people, right: a lot of people are like, I just don't like him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But the reason why they don't like him is because of the premise that he comes.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He ran up under resentment, no offense, but he really did.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, a lot of whites, he felt like he appealed to the ones who felt like, oh, man, you know, we haven't had our day.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So he got with them.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I just think with him, you think she's got it all all together.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, I'm excited to see Obama, of course, like why not: and we're very excited to support Vice President Harris because we need strong leadership.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
What is it about Trump that you do not like: he's unhinged.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he doesn't care about people at all.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Nothing at all: no, so you think he did a terrible job as president: oh, absolutely.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He turned that into more of a disaster than it would have been under better leadership.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And to see what they're still going through after the hurricanes and to know under Trump's presidency, he was trying to deny them any help because he said that they weren't our problem when, i'm sorry.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that is something that probably does need to be to change, and I think a lot of that, especially when it comes to, you know, the Harris administration, they look, they're going to look for ways to make things easier to access for everyday people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I... Trump is not going to do that.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So that lady basically said, what did Trump do wrong: and she said, well, Covid, you messed up Covid.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So that opinion is new, all he knows is Project 2025.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I'm not saying he's not smart.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's smart, but he also doesn't think women should have the rights.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that goes along with, you know, the... the two billionaires that are supporting him, the fool who sent him... Peter... Peter Tule.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Peter Tule, who actually... Yeah, the tool, he actually paid for J.D. Vance to go to college.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, this guy is really dangerous because he said women should not be voting.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And J.D, vance even said if he had his way, you... if you had four kids, you and your wife would have six votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I'm going to go back to the neighborhoods and find some Trump people.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris is getting about 7% of Republicans.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So there's no real clear leader with independents, but numerically, Harris has this slight higher number there.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But among likely voters, Harris is plus six, 50% to 44% with women.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And Donald Trump is plus six, equally 51% to 45% with men.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"What is some of what you're learning behind those numbers, right, so, you know, lots of people on the Democratic side of the equation say, how could it be possible that it's tied, why is Harris not running away with this: well, if the environment that she's running in, we asked folks, your financial situation over the past year, so today compared to a year now, a plurality, nearly half, 49%, say they are worse off today financially than they were a year ago.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So what does that mean, then, why isn't Donald Trump running away with it if that's the environment: well, here's one issue.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump's still doing his best on immigration.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But that abortion and reproductive rights number, that's one of the reasons Donald Trump is not yet running away with this race.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I think this explains a lot about why Democrats are so nervous, right: like, Harris was supposed to rebuild this coalition from Obama to, you know, kind of wash away the fears about Joe Biden.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris is gonna be talking about abortion.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
He's talking about democracy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump is talking about immigration.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He talks a lot about the economy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The Trump curious, the Trump leaning voters, those are the things they talk about the most.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And the theory, their theory of the case is it is, and maybe even more so, because they believe, and this is part of the stories that you hear Harris telling on the trail.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And the Harris campaign believes that is part of what is keeping the issue so salient.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Okay, so that's abortion, and it's just sticking on the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The question Trump's pledge to go after enemies if elected, reason to vote against him, 50%, doesn't make a difference, 26, reason to vote for him, 24.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But Donald Trump's behavior is clearly another part of this equation, as are his criminal convictions.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But the total, and he's more popular than ever, all those things are true, but they are still weights around him because I think without them, Donald Trump may be running away with it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So Saturday, Kamala Harris is going to be campaigning in a rally in Kalamazoo, trying to utilize a college town, Western Michigan University, with some special help from former First Lady Michelle Obama.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Traverse City itself is kind of a pretty little blue dot on the map now, but around it is Brock Ribb, a Republican territory, and his appeal to low propensity, particularly male voters in rural areas.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, that was kind of his marquee voter back in the 2016 cycle and Michigan after after losing it in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's certainly really trying to get that back.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump has done really well in in in Macomb County, the northern suburb of Detroit that's more more blue collar for his auto industry message is really honed in on his his railing against electric vehicles.",Donald Trump,Michigan
There are a couple of state house races that are really hinging on on how how well Trump does at least hinging for Republicans.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris has gone on several radio shows that are pretty popular in metro Detroit like the Breakfast Club.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's she's been making a pretty direct appeals to that subset of voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And to that point, one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in the African American community is former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who he essentially sprung from prison on his last day in office by commuting his sentence for his for his 20 years in the city hall, and Kilpatrick is out working various networks he's he's done radio ads for Trump that are on black radio stations.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And the other thing that Trump is trying to do is he's trying to, he's trying to take advantage of the downright crisis the democrats have with their Arab American constituency.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And one of the main leaders of this is us rep Rashida to leave who prominent Democrat from Detroit has not said who she's voting for president which is something that I think looms over, over the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If you look at 2016 Donald Trump won the state by 10,704 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump recently made negative comments about Detroit calling it just horrible claiming that the city's never fully come back.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It may sway some of those people on the margins who have previously been a little conservative but not loved the Trump presidency.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"That will, you know, depend and we have three really hot competitive U.S. House races in Michigan that also could swing the balance of power in the House and so those battlegrounds kind of play into that, into the turnout factors for both President and Senate as well and so but Mike Rogers, the Republican has been on the ascent and largely because at the end of August he just was running in our late August poll, he had like 72 percent of Trump voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I mean this is Trump messaging up and down the I-75 corridor between Detroit and Oakland County and Macomb County and then you go up into Flint and Saginaw Bay City that in our county is like one to watch on election night it has been a bellwether in Michigan presidential elections in the last in this century essentially and if Trump wins it like he did in 2016 seems like he might have a chance of going out of victory.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Look, if you look at, look, too much of this conversation, by the way, is asymmetrical, right: it's all about Harris and what she's got to do.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But quite frankly, I'm more if I'm on the other side and I'm calling this, look, it's just as much about what Donald Trump's got to do.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If you look at Michigan and Wisconsin, where is Donald Trump not in the polling, but where he is on election day: he's always at 47, 48%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But I would argue that he's got to break above 47, 48% in Michigan and Wisconsin in order to win those states without a lot of third party voting.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so if Trump picks off any one of these states, particularly Pennsylvania, then that's the ball game here, folks.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They're incorporating Trump into their ads favorably, praising the work they've done with them.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So bringing Barack Obama here where he can try to fill that space while Vice President Harris is doing interviews today can try to get voters capitalizing on the moment they can vote now.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Here's what he said just a short time ago.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And you're right, two big interviews today for Kamala Harris later today with Halle Jackson and obviously another one later, too.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And he also said that he can't respond to her.,Donald Trump,Michigan
She has to be at a rally for him to be able to talk about her.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now on X, of course, formerly Twitter, which he owns, Musk frequently shares misleading and false claims about the election going as far as picking fights with Michigan's top election official Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Ahead of events in and around Detroit, President Trump will sit down for an interview with Fox News personality and former professional wrestler, Tyrus, on his podcast, Maintaining with Tyrus, while the Vice President kicks off a two-day tour of the state with events in Grand Rapids, Lansing, and the Detroit area as well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Robert, good morning to you, what are we expecting from the former president first: good morning to you, Marky.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You have the former president in downtown Detroit, whereas vice president Kamala Harris will be in Grand Rapids and then in the suburban areas of the Detroit metro area.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
47% said that they will vote for former President Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He only had 640,000 voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So we got uncommitted here, so Trump got 640,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump only got 640, biden got 623.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Right here, so here's Trump, you only got 64.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But it's because he's the incumbent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's the incumbent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So pretty significant drop off and Trump got shellacked.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Happening this morning, early voting is set to begin in Detroit today with the polls opening at 9 a.m. And it is in the Motor City where Kamala Harris is also today meeting with faith leaders in hopes of shoring up their support.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So it's extremely close, perhaps Kamala Harris is just a step behind.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She is going to be in Detroit today.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump was the one who brought the Muslim ban.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump is no friend of the Arab-American community.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And for him to come and insult our great city, for Trump to come and insult the great people of Detroit is not acceptable.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I said on my Twitter that keep Detroit and the people of Detroit out of your mouth, Mr. Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, I know you have a busy day ahead of you as you go to that rally with Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
He says volunteering for the Trump campaign is motivated by patriotism.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"In a town hall in Flint last week, he focused on cheap electric vehicle imports from China, a concern to many Michigan auto workers.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In Detroit last week, Harris did not address Gaza.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She highlighted Republican efforts to restrict abortion, which has been a winning issue for Democrats.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
But Fox News polling shows Trump has regained the lead with 50% to 48%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The trends are going Trump's way, as I mentioned, Nate Silver now has him up just very slightly.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I just wanna make sure he knows what a real poll says.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So she didn't get a positive bump to her level of support, but he might have driven some of his voters away.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala had about a one and a half point lead going into debate.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And once a huge number of Americans have heard him saying crazy things.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And the fact that actually, hourly after Taylor Swift posted what she posted, calling herself a childless cat lady and saying that she urges everyone to register to vote and more specifically to vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, they got 10,000 clicks on voter registration, an hour, an hour.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Who do you think out of the two would be more likely to listen to you and understand your concerns, which is not like, do you think they won the debate, will you vote for them, it's just does it seem like a person that would actually care about what you're going through: 49% said Harris, only 18% said Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Which is lower than the percentage who said he won the debate overall.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Why that matters: small, but influential group of voters inside a big county, inside a big swing state, that Joe Biden needs to win, that Donald Trump wants to win back.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And they have very strong opinions against Biden, despite the fact that it could lead to a win for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Absolutely, yeah, where do you think this Michigan story goes next, or what will you be looking for to signal whether or not the president will have sufficient support or whether perhaps Donald Trump's able to win back the Wolverine state: well, I would like to see over the course of the election year how people start to respond to the Biden administration when they're sort of confronted with the reality that we could potentially be facing a Biden versus Trump election again.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has figured out a way to thread the needle, stay away from the federal prosecution of Donald Trump and the fake electors and all that that goes into a conspiracy yet bring to justice 16 members of the Michigan GOP Republican Party who met in a basement and signed fraudulent certificates of election as electors which they weren't to try to give the election to their candidate of choice Donald Trump and away from what the Michigan voters wanted, which was of course President Joe Biden and now they've been brought to justice by Dana Nessel who with the permission of a magistrate judge at Ingram County has indicted 16 of these fake electors.",Donald Trump,Michigan
What do you want to do about it: we're either going to go after them ourselves criminally for all of the Michigan and state law crimes they committed or Jack Smith you're going to do it and now watching nine months of Jack Smith indicting for Mar-a-Lago Donald Trump about to indict because we got the announcement on the same day within hours of Dana Nessel taking the podium.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So so how did Dana Nessel both come up with a robust muscular state-based approach and get out of the way of Jack Smith impossible preemption or big footing by the federal prosecutors of her case and yet look Michiganders in the eye and say I'm doing right by you as the top lawyer top cop in in Michigan she indicts and she indicts just the fake electors she doesn't make it a broader a broader conspiracy though she could have and brought in everybody else including Donald Trump and John Eastman of Rudy Giuliani and everybody else she didn't do that she focused uniquely on just her citizens her residents of Michigan and brought a count or so against each one of them and that's the way she can maintain her own case at the same time Jack Smith goes after Donald Trump and the others and the other states this could be a model for the other states we're seeing for instance in Arizona the Attorney General doing about the same thing she's just further behind she's not ready to indict she's developing her evidence but I expect now based on you know Dana Nessel breaking that glass ceiling of prosecutors state prosecutors others will do the same thing because they'll say it can be it can be plus it can be two it doesn't have to be well we have to wait to see what the feds do about our own criminals in our own midst we can do it too I think this is going to be a real blueprint and a road model and hats off to Dana Nessel the Attorney General Attorney General Nessel for doing that let me just give because it's important for transparency who we're talking about and what we're talking about on this hot take on this explainer my old mattress would overheat while my partner and I were laying in it together making for a terrible night's sleep I'm so excited to say that this

house of Michigan even the leadership in the state house the speaker of the house for Michigan right and also the majority leader for Michigan went in November 20th of that year to the White House to meet with Donald Trump and they came away and issued a press statement that said yeah yeah we met with the president but we didn't really see anything that indicates that this wasn't a fair election or that anything was unfair about Michigan or that its votes should go somewhere else well apparently 16 people that met in the basement of the GOP headquarters and you can't make this stuff up thought otherwise they thought there was a way to steal the election from Joe Biden and undercut the will of the people in their own state and hand deliver the the the presidency to the person that they wanted not the people that michigan michigan people wanted but even the leadership in the state house thought that was crazy uh but wasn't crazy enough for these people who are these people well let's just run it down Kathy Bearden age 70 Hank Chote 72 Amy Fachinello 55 Clifford Frost 75 Stanley Grot 71 John Haggard 82 Mary Ann Henry 65 Tim King 56 I'm reading out there their ages so you know these aren't children these people know better you know these are you know 50 60 70 and 80 year olds in in the state of Michigan Michelle Lundgren 73 Miss Shawn Maddock 55 James Renner 76 Myra Rodriguez 64 Rose Rook 81 Mary Ann Sheridan 69 Ken Thompson 68 Kent Vanderwood 69 and of the 16 I just mentioned two in particular Kathy Bearden is on the Republican National Committee and his close friends with its chairperson Rona McDaniel Mitt Romney's niece and Michelle Maddock former co-chair of the Michigan GOP you have been indicted by your attorney general and here here is the indictment everybody gets the same swag bag from the attorney general Nessel everybody gets that I just listed one count of conspiracy to commit forgery which is a 14 year possible felony two counts of forgery a 14 year felony one count of conspiracy to commit uttering and publishing usually means a false statement a 14 year felony one count of uttering and publishing a false statement another 14 year felony one count of conspiracy to commit election law forgery a five-year felony and two counts of election law forgery a five-year felony and the the attorney general's office we we've heard her statement at the top of this hot take of attorney general Nessel but they went on to say in a written press statement that the false electors actions undermine the public's faith in the integrity of our elections and we believe also plainly violated the laws by which we administer our elections in Michigan my department meaning the attorney general of Michigan's department has prosecuted numerous cases cases of election law violations throughout my tenure and it would be malfeasance for the greatest magnitude of the greatest magnitude if my department failed to act here in the face of overwhelming evidence of an organized effort to circumvent the lawfully cast ballots of millions of Michigan voters in a presidential election couldn't have said it any better than attorney general Nessel I don't think this is going to be the end I think this is the blueprint all attorney generals in the battleground states can use to both establish their own territory get their own piece of turf and real estate to go after their citizens involved in the fake electors and kind of stay away from this sprawling more conspiracy oriented set of charges and indictments brought by either Jack Smith which would include Donald Trump and or Fawny Willis the Fulton County DA who is also looking at places like Michigan and the as part of her conspiracy but this is a perfect thread the needle right this is putting a camel through the eye of the needle in the form of let's just go after our state's bad people alleged bad people and we'll do that and we'll stay away from Jack Smith's prosecution and we can live harmoniously side by side as parallel prosecutors and that's that's what attorney generals who are the top prosecutors for each state can do if you do it the way that attorney general Nessel did I'll follow on breaking news and otherwise an analysis developments just like this one at the intersection of US law and politics here only on the Midas Touch Network I do

We always hear about Harris having to defend her blue wall and of course Michigan is a major part of that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So we look at places like Detroit where Trump will have a rally tonight.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I shouldn't say only, 46% of Arizonans say she would put immigrants before citizens.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She doesn't have the record to run on.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think that's been hurting her.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Vice President Kamala Harris kicks off her presidential campaign today while praising President Joe Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Following the president's announcement, much of Michigan's top Democratic leaders are also putting their support behind Vice President Harris for that nomination.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Following President Joe Biden's exit from the presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris quickly racking up endorsements from a number of top Michigan Democrats.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And she was part of that ticket.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If anything, and some of the issues, especially regarding the automobile industry, she's further left than where Joe Biden was.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think she will be a strong candidate.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think she'll be a great president of the United States.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, a close ally of Biden during his race, acknowledged her personal choice is not necessarily set just yet.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's got to go out and work.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But as support within the party continues to grow, many are looking to whom Harris will choose to be her potential running mate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I'm not going anywhere, so what should Harris be looking forward to win Michigan: quite frankly, I want to see someone who cares about the Heartland, who understands the battleground state, who's going to work hard to bring people together, who's going to care about our economy fighting for working men and women.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So I think there are probably a number of candidates that she is going to be looking for.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But after the last 24 hours, the list of those who could have the clout to challenge Vice President Harris has gotten very narrow.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump is winning, now, admittedly, only one of these polls is from after the debate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Maybe this isn't all roses and ginger snaps for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That doesn't look very good, given that Donald Trump lost Michigan in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, the Harris campaign quickly turning the former president's remarks into campaign ads.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Everyone is well aware of the former president's comments and the response is coming from the Harris campaign.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But I think with the Trump administration, Detroit could take off like an Elon Musk rocket ship.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I am endorsing him and telling my community to vote for him as well.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So why on earth vote for Donald Trump and encourage others to do it: because I believe there has to be accountability.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris is going to continue the same exact policies under Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She is saying that her campaign advisers have come out and said it.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
They all want the Biden-Harris administration to get much tougher with Israel and try harder to stop the civilian deaths.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Online ads try to emphasize Kamala Harris' understanding of the civilian cost of this conflict.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
But Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan want her to lay out a Middle East strategy that differs from Joe Biden's.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Backing his call for cease fires in Gaza and Lebanon is not enough for her to win back some crucial Michigan voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Under the Trump administration, we were going through COVID, and it was a really tough time for us, so we pivoted into construction, and we've been doing great since then.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Which gives you the most optimism for the next four years for your business: i really support Kamala Harris and the $50,000 that she's proposing to give to startups.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Number one, what's really driving my vote is Kamala wants to unite us and we do better united than divided.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump leads by just 1%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris leads by 4 points.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump leads by 3 points.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris has an 8-point advantage here.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Amongst registered voters, the numbers are a bit less beneficial for Kamala Harris, but amongst likely voters, her lead expands.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And so at large here Kamala Harris holds roughly a one point advantage amongst key state likely voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That's pretty substantial for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
What they're finding here is that Kamala Harris is up by four.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Because I do think what we have found between Georgia and Michigan is that should Michigan start to revert away from Kamala Harris, like we've been seeing over the past week and Georgia starts to inch closer to her, it's a possibility that, especially maybe not this cycle, but in future cycles, because Michigan is becoming a state that has a higher concentration of non-college-educated white voters that tend to be the strongest base for the Republican Party in comparison to states like Georgia, where you're starting to see an increase of white college-educated voters and voters of color across the state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"As of right now, Kamala Harris holds a narrow advantage, but ultimately still a close race.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Beyond that, though, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, that's enough for Kamala Harris to win the election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
It puts him at 265.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But it's definitely pleasant news for the Kamala Harris campaign where they previously were thinking, no data points between now and the election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
We're going to do them a benefit.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And Kamala Harris, unsurprisingly, is maintaining that average in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania and making inroads in some of these Sun Belt states like Georgia while still remaining competitive in Nevada, though slightly losing in Arizona, North Carolina.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"This is interesting for a few reasons, not the least of which before Joe Biden said I'm going to step aside and endorse Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Spending the entire RNC did Trump and his fellow Republicans attacking Joe Biden, making the case as to why Joe Biden shouldn't can't must not be president.",Donald Trump,Michigan
There's also an ABC News Ipsos poll showing Harris's favorability overall at 43.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That's up eight up eight and Trump's favorability down to 36.,Donald Trump,Michigan
These are really bad numbers for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It is effectively tied Trump leading by an average of zero point seven, zero point seven.",Donald Trump,Michigan
This has been consistent where Vice President Harris has had a lead on values and that's starting to expand a little bit.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
42 percent said it's Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
47 percent of the group said they trust Vice President Kamala Harris more and that's not it.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Donald Trump, over 270 electoral votes, he would clinch the presidency for a second time, but no map is a foregone conclusion.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Here's a scenario that's probably her likeliest path to victory.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
They're looking at the gender gap.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What do the numbers actually say: well, I mean, during the Trump administration, there was, you know, from the beginning of Trump's first, you know, when he was inaugurated in 2017 to his the peak of his employment in Michigan, we're not my Michigan alone.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But a lot of those gains were also seen during the Trump administration.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And Donald Trump often talks about crime on the campaign trail as well.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But I want to remind people, people know who Donald Trump is.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He was the Donald Trump we all know.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But it did seem to show a little bit of a different story than kind of what the summer had brought for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
They know what will happen to this country if he's president again.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I think Kamala Harris wins.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think Michigan goes with Harris walls.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You took Beaver County, which is Trump country.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It is definitely Trump country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Who did the Democrats lose over these years: i think if you even go back eight years, all three of our states went for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We understand that there are Republicans out there who are lamenting that Donald Trump is their nominee.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And some of the averages they see Trump actually making a gate.,Donald Trump,Michigan
They know who Donald Trump is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
They know what he has done.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"What are they waiting to hear: i mean, they have watched Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They have watched Kamala Harris over these past few months.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Donald Trump talks a good game about that.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, he has a history of failing to deliver over and over and over again.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I think part of our responsibility here is to make sure we're letting folks know that despite the noise, despite the bluster, despite the words that come out of his mouth, they're not only empty promises now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"As Gretchen says, we got the receipts to prove that when he had the keys to the White House before, he failed the American people time and time again.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But to that point, again, back to those polls, the economy, immigration, by far those people who are polled trust Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So what you're saying about, look, he didn't do the job back then, they don't think that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Again, people are still supporting Donald Trump despite what you're saying.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"His message is getting through, donald Trump has done nothing for the state of Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And it had nothing to do with Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So Donald Trump's message is getting through.,Donald Trump,Michigan
The very kinds of policies that Kamala Harris is running on.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Others are flat out saying, we're not endorsing Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Donald Trump all hate, that issue, that is a very, very big issue.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Governor, you've already heard what Donald Trump said this week.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Kamala Harris wins, what's your big worry: he's already laying the groundwork to undermine the outcome of this election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I do not have confidence that Donald Trump won't whine about it, won't put out dangerous rhetoric and mis- and disinformation.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's the threat, and I will tell the good people of this Commonwealth and this country, we're prepared for anything Donald Trump throws at us.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Kamala, she doesn't do anything.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Donald Trump has been reaching out to young male voters, shirking traditional media interviews for conversations with podcasters, influencers and gamers, all popular with the so-called bro vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's been doing loads of different podcasts and stuff.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's smart, good marketing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's more personable, too, you get to see what he's really like, you know: honestly, it just feels like he's being honest.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's a tough one to answer, i think he's more dominant, he's more, uh... Go away!",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Other leaders fear him, you know: he gets the word across.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump is trying to breach that divide, reaching out to black men, traditional Democrats that poll suggest could switch over to his side.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Despite that, David will still vote for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Tell us about that because he won, but there was some controversy surrounding his victory and Donald Trump, as expected, won in Michigan as well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump, for his part, still managed to underperform what we would expect for a major party leading candidate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't think there's any real serious concern that they would vote for President Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, well, the court appearance has certainly helped him with his political base, which has helped him to secure a renomination with the Republican Party.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So that has redounded to its advantage, the problem is that these court appearances don't sit nearly as well with independent and moderate voters who he's going to need to win the general election.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So while it has been beneficial to him thus far, once he's locked up the nomination, these repeated court cases are going to prove to be a little bit more of a drag.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump is right on the line there at 50-47.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The difference, I told you all in 2016, Donald Trump is going to win Michigan and nobody believed me, including many at Fox.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They understand that they've got to better define themselves.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
They know where their target audiences are.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
They're working it.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And you've got to, i don't think people know Kamala Harris yet.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I do, i don't think she's how great she is.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
They need to feel her.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
We all know who Donald Trump is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But he is who he is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's passionate.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And he says what he thinks, and people know him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They want to know that they know her.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think she's trying to do that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's doing more media interviews.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's doing different places.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And they just need to, i wish they'd just let her go into the union hall, quite frankly.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
We've seen a lot of discussion identified this a couple of months ago is young black men who... And it's not her problem.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"They want to be talked to directly, what she's doing in Detroit today is taking that on directly.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"A week ago, we had Harris at 226.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So Trump is right on the line there at 50-47.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The difference is people understand they're both- Both campaigns understand that they're competitive, but I would argue that Vice President Harris and Governor Walts are taking it seriously.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Like I'm all around, i don't have to go there a lot, but when I drive through Michigan, Grand Rapids area, Detroit, Metro Detroit, when I drive through these cities, there are a lot, Oakland County, which is Metro, there are a lot of Trump signs.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I will see Trump signs back to back to back to back.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And in my mind, I said, I know Michigan is a big state, but I don't see how she's gonna win Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I can see how she gets Wayne County, but I don't see how she's gonna get Oakland.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't see how she's gonna get Macomb.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't see how she's gonna get even these other areas.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, there's some liberal like cities and stuff, but I don't see how she's gonna win Michigan, yo.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I'm not on the electoral board, but from what I see driving around the last couple of months, nothing, but Trump signs everywhere.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So even including myself, I didn't give Donald Trump the 2016 vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I didn't give it to Hillary, I gave it to Jill Stein, but I'm considering Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But from what I'm seeing now, she's losing momentum.",Donald Trump,Michigan
People are starting to get to know her.,Donald Trump,Michigan
They're starting to see that she's kind of fake and she's phony and they want the economy better.,Donald Trump,Michigan
They want the economy like they had it when Trump was running.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So she hasn't found a way to separate her way from Biden.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"She has not, she's constantly still running on continuation of what's going on.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Bidenomics 2.0, right: sensational, so I won't be surprised at all if on election day or the day after election day, if they call Michigan for Donald Trump, because if they do, I would say that makes sense.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And Trump is kind of all we know.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And they're kind of Trump and Biden.,Donald Trump,Michigan
We weren't with Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And we were broke with Biden and we weren't with Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Odds are you know quite a bit about January 6th and the litany of criminal and civil cases brought against Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, it has broken through that life sucks under this regime and that Donald Trump is being persecuted by lawfare.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is an amazing clip, has all of the felonies and indictments against Trump has, has that worked to persuade voters actually has made him more popular.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, nobody should be able to dictate that at all, and what do you think of Trump's position on abortion, i think he's anti, isn't he: yeah.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He wants to control that, yeah, well, I don't think he has any business even talking about it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So I'd like that to change, do you feel like Donald Trump's going to be better on that issue: based on what we've seen on his first four years, I do believe that he will be better on that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Is there anything that Vice President Harris could do at this point to change your mind: not particularly, no.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Unless she changes her stance completely on fixing the border.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It is exactly these answers, which is why Donald Trump is now winning effectively on all of the swing states.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Could Donald Trump win the popular vote: well, he is a populist candidate and populism is popular.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Nate Silver's Bolton has Kamala Harris leading 0.6 percent.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
270 to win has Donald Trump leading 0.4 percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Decisintesk HQ, The Hill has Trump leading 0.6 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And 538 has Harris leading 0.1 percent, certainly a very very close race back and forth.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Very very close, looking at the political market forecasting odds, Polymarket has Trump at 59 percent in the state of Michigan to win it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"As for national, Trump currently has 64.3 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump got over 264,000 votes from Wayne County.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump got 325,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris's job in Michigan is to try and match what Joe Biden did.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If she's under-performing Biden, then it depends by how much, because that may be enough ground for Trump to make up and win the state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Biden had over 223,000, this is a very, very big win right outside of Detroit for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump got 165,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump won it by 3.1.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Where does Harris end up performing on election night: that is what we're watching for.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And Donald Trump got 47.8 percent of the statewide vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"We're going to look right first at Ottawa County, where it was 59.8 percent for Trump, 38.4 for Biden.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Kent County right next door, again, this is where Grand Rapids is, 52.1 for Biden, 45.9 for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Kalamazoo County right here, 58.4 to 39.6, a win for Biden, ingham County right here, 65.2 to 33, a win for Biden over Trump, saginaw County was 49.4 to 49.1.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Macomb County right here, 53.4 to 45.3, a win for Trump over Biden, oakland County right here, 56.4 to 42.3, a win for Biden over Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Washtenaw County, 72.6 to 26, a win for Biden, and Wayne County, Detroit, 68.5 to 30.3, a win for Biden over Trump, now, as I mentioned, there were some key counties I did also want to mention really quickly.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Looking at the 2016 map where Donald Trump won the state, he had 47.5% of the statewide vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Ottawa County 62 to 31.5 win for Trump, kent County 48.1 to 45% a win for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Macomb County 53.6 to 42.1 a win for Trump, oakland County 51.6 to 43.5 a win for Clinton.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So even though he lost the state, he did perform better in Michigan than he did in 2016.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So I am very confident barring a massive polling list that Donald Trump will get somewhere between 41.6 and 50.9% in the state of Michigan on election night 2024.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"However, we're not used to seeing in Michigan Trump being up 1.2% in the state compared to the polling in 2016 and 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"We never saw that, so we're kind of an uncharted territory and seeing Trump leading in the state of Michigan in the polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And looking at the factors now for the state of Michigan, the state polling data, as I mentioned, Trump is up 1.2% right now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
That factor goes for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So that certainly benefits Donald Trump and would lead to a likely electoral college win for Trump and a popular vote defeat.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Michigan had about a two-point lead for Kamala Harris just a few weeks ago.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Now Trump is leading here by 1.2%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And Michigan has been one of the ones where he's been gaining a lot more than some of the other ones.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The polling error advantage, this one I was very tricky on because from 2012 to 2020, it was a very narrow advantage actually for Kamala Harris where the Democrat was up by 0.56%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That is certainly a benefit for Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So that does benefit Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump would still be favored based on all the factors to win the state of Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"For my prediction for the state of Michigan in its 15 electoral votes, I'm predicting that Donald Trump will win the state of Michigan with 49.4% of the vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That has not happened yet, if Trump doesn't on election night, he'll be the first Republican in Michigan to do that, I think since the 1980s.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I think Kamala Harris, she's not going to do, she's not going to be bad enough, like Hillary Clinton was in the state of Michigan in 2016, where it's 47.3%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I don't think she's going to go quite that low.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"In the margin of victory of 1.1%, it aligns right now where Harris is leading the national vote by 0.9, and the average popular vote difference in Michigan was 1.96.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Do you think that's Kamala Harris then: yes, I do.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
What is it about Trump that just says no: he's an idiot.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He is an idiot.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"A new ABC News poll among likely voters has Harris up by four points, 51% to 47%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Among black voters, Harris is outperforming Biden's 2020 margin with black men by 14 points and by seven points with black women.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And for white women with college degrees, Harris is winning by 14 points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Meanwhile, more voters think Trump is more likely to say that things are not true.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, Donald Trump can win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And they just kept saying that they were they were so sure they're going to win that it was Mitt Romney and Karl Rove who were shocked on election night and knew something had to be wrong with numbers because they weren't winning.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So the bubble inside Trump world is overwhelming, saying that Donald Trump is going to win this race.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I'm surprised myself by still being surprised by how negative, how exclusionary, how racist the attacks against Puerto Rico, the attacks again against Hispanic, against Hispanic, exactly what Donald Trump said years ago, that Hispanics were breeders.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But you have trend lines going the way the Harris campaign would obviously want it to be.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I think the number I keep going back to and it's a number that I have been looking at for three years now, if Donald Trump is going to run.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And the number is forty seven, donald Trump is at forty seven percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump is at forty eight percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's not happening now, so I guess if Harris does win and she has a four point lead like fifty one to forty seven, everybody's going to go, you know, why: of course, you idiots.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
There was he was never going to get over forty seven percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Maybe we'll be saying that, but I still think that's the question for Donald Trump to win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But but still, that's where I'm still suck, he's got a hard ceiling.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"How does he win with forty seven percent of the vote nationally, even as you project that toward electoral college votes: joey doesn't.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And Donald Trump is giving you that repeatedly.,Donald Trump,Michigan
We're all from the Kalamazoo area and all very big supporters of Kamala and Michelle and so we were super excited to come here.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
We started when the election started and we're doing it to fund the election for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I mean, it's a wonderful decision that she's making to support the community and show that she's a good president.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Girl power, she could never have imagined the possibility of Madam President looking like this.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Yeah, good morning, George, we have seen real momentum for Vice President Harris, and it is transferring into the places where the election is most likely to be decided.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And as she turns to her choice for running mate, we're seeing that most Americans don't really have an opinion of any of them, but to the extent they do, we're seeing some relatively positive numbers for people, including Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He has 49% of the vote, while Harris holds 47%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, one of the things that I keep on talking about is when Donald Trump was in Michigan and he was in a non-union shop, he pretended it was like a union shop.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He gave non-union workers signs that said union workers for Trump, then he told them that they're picketing for the wrong reasons.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This clip just continues to stand out in my mind, but also Donald Trump continued to make representations about the auto industry in Michigan that just don't seem to match reality.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Chad is the politics editor at the Detroit News and obviously writes a lot of pieces about the auto industry in Michigan, but one stood out to me recently where you talked about how Donald Trump keeps lamenting the big auto plants are being constructed in Mexico.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Does Donald Trump's rhetoric on the auto industry meet the reality: it does not.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He is kind of actively out trashing the transition to electric vehicles and then turns around and praises Tesla and calls those EVs beautiful.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so this was a really interesting moment where he's in essentially a bedroom community of Lansing, Michigan that has two major general motors plants.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so here you had Trump, he was trashing the Infra- the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, but that IRA, that law is providing a $500 million grant to General Motors to convert that Lansing Grand River plant to an EV plant in the future.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When Donald Trump goes into Michigan, goes to a non-union plant, pretends it's a union plant, like literally creates a scene like out of the apprentice with people holding signs, to me, and when I hear what President Sean Fain says, that's highly offensive to make a mockery of workers and their livelihood.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump should know that, and he definitely knows that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's the self-proclaimed king of debt.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So Ford, for example, is partnering with a Chinese battery maker, CATL, to build a battery plant 35 miles away from where Donald Trump was standing last week.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, literally Donald Trump could not have come to a more important corridor right now in Michigan than the I-69 corridor where he was standing at this auto, or it's a metal supply plant.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And we actually checked to make sure that this Alro steel that he was at, they're not a supplier, at least known to be a supplier for these two major projects, which would have been kind of a sort of red flag.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"These investments are not made lightly, they are 25, 30 year investments, which is why GM is making this, building this $2 billion plant to build batteries down the road from where Trump was.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And Ford is building its own $2 billion plant down the road, because they are making a long-term play to be part of this.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And that's another thing that I kind of keep noticing when Trump talks about the auto industry.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Chad, finally, when I was watching Donald Trump speak at that factory, I couldn't help but notice the people who were behind him, who were from time to time, they looked a little confused by some of the things.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, when we reached out to the CEO of that company, he said, well, Donald Trump asked to do a press conference here.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And we saw this in our polling this week, which our Detroit News, WDIV poll shows Trump with just a narrow one point lead, well within the margin of error.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Maybe this is the fear that he's looking for to try to capitalize on.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Four years before that, Trump took it from the Democrats by just 10,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It would have never happened, iran was broke under Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I'm still undecided, do you like Donald Trump: yeah.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Fine, do you know: because I think he's like fighter.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's like fighter, fighter man.",Donald Trump,Michigan
What's Donald Trump's answer to the Gaza war: he is a convenient line for both sides.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And he loves telling Michigan's voters all about his daughter Tiffany's new Arab husband, Michael Bulos, the son of a Lebanese billionaire.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We like him.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump says he's going to deport 15 million illegal migrants.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The last time he was president, he banned Muslims from coming into the US from six different Muslim countries.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So he said a lot and done less.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Again, he's coming from a business perspective.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I wouldn't really believe he would do that as much like, you know, he's just saying it to back outskipping.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If he does that, he'll be, like, you know, impacting the economy.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And this is not really one of his goals, so to summarise, you're going to vote for Trump because he's not going to do precisely what he says he's going to do.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris is doing her best to reset.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And that's her problem, but it too much to the palace and inside and she risks alienating America's 7.5 million Jewish voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now, they know that Kamala isn't resonating with voters there.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's not connecting because they see what all of us see.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala just doesn't kind of jive with the blue collar voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She doesn't connect with the middle class.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
They see through her lame campaign of joy and all of her biographical bloviating.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And now the Trump campaign is practically making Michigan its second home.,Donald Trump,Michigan
The Trump Republican Party is the party of the American worker and it's also the party of common sense.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And it always will be, now, let's take a look at how Trump has done in Michigan historically.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Tell me what areas in Michigan are probably the best now for the Trump campaign to target and that are flippable from the last election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Hillary Clinton was ahead in the polls in 2016 until she wasn't, until President Trump recognized how important Michigan was and camped out in Michigan in the final days.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And we responded by recognizing that the way the Obama administration was leading the country is exactly the way the Harris administration has been leading the country right into a ditch.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
President Trump understands how important Michigan is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, Michigan also could be trouble with Muslim voters for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The 10th congressional district comprises southern portion of Macomb County and Rochester and Rochester Hills, and not only are Democrats going after President Trump, but they're also coming after me.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That is disqualifying for anyone, so President Trump is building his coalition.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They thought there was a chance and they're not going to spend two billion dollars on building a plant and then have, you know, Trump get elected and put two hundred percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, we do have more great polling news for none other than Donald J. Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We've got a new Harris X poll.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
We've got Harris plus four.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump is sitting plus eight when you combine all the battleground states and all their polling.,Donald Trump,Michigan
We like that Trump is up eight when you combine the battlegrounds.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Can we not get the data state by state by state, can we get that, is that too much to ask for, like why are we combining them: but we like that Trump is up.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We like that Trump is up by eight.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And so now Kamala is only sitting plus point six.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Now Kamala's lead is down to point six.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
We're following it with a microscope here and we're seeing Kamala Harris's lead slowly slip away.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
But it doesn't even matter even if we go into election night with her plus point six.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Biden was plus eight, hillary was plus six.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump is the ultimate closer.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, CBS is going to come out and probably say Harris is up by one if I had to guess.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You're going to be accurate, harris is not winning Michigan by one point, let alone four points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Now Trump's down to plus point six and you've got liberals left and right.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It was reported yesterday that she didn't even think she was going to win Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Her internal campaign reported it.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And they're saying like she's screaming at the top of her lungs at people and she's just miserable to be around Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And now she's not even doing rallies.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"They also, yeah, they got it tied.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Hillary was plus six, she lost.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now Trump's plus point one, he's obviously pulling a lot better.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Remember when liberal whales manipulated Polymarket during the debate and acted like Kamala one.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Holy crap, trump went up from 60 was 66 down to 61 back up to 63.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's it's Trump's leading all these swing states if Trump's up eight, but they combine them, it's like, why see, why are we combining these: this doesn't make any sense.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We've got Nate Silver now finally admitting that Trump's going to win.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It was inevitable, he said, quote, My gut says Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So he's saying that Trump's barely going to win.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And then we'll know how well Trump did.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But no, they got to they got to put out a poll that has Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, Harris is not going to win Michigan by four and then Wisconsin be a tie.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And Trump probably wins by around three point two.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"How big of a lead does he have: well, it's a tiny lead right now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"OK, so 46% of Michigan voters said they would vote for Trump and 42% said they would vote for Biden.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump won with 47.8, so Michigan is always tight.",Donald Trump,Michigan
One place where we recently saw Trump and Biden trying to woo Michigan voters was when the auto workers went on strike.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The president joined them on the picket line, and Trump visited some non-union shops.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I mean, it's hard to know for sure, but directionally, it does look like Trump is starting to get more sort of oomph with the auto workers.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I talked to Brian Pennevicker, who is part of the group Auto Workers for Trump, and he kind of sums up why he thinks Biden is starting to lose some ground with the auto workers.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that's what they're going to vote on, Donald Trump's policies.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And Trump does really well with sort of his populist message.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It also finds that voters trust Trump more than Biden when it comes to the economy by a 14-point margin.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And that's when Trump was president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And they are thinking about a pre-COVID world when Donald Trump was running the country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Then you have the rural areas where Trump has a tremendous amount of support.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump won the election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Compare that to just a few weeks ago when Harris held a two-point lead.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So we're seeing an independent split here among these independent voters, Trump slightly winning these voters 47 to 45.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, we really see Slotkin overperforming compared to Harris here, 48% versus Rogers, 46%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And it might be better to phrase that as Rogers is really underperforming Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So you can kind of see how some of these independent voters may prefer a Trump approach to some of these issues, the economy and immigration, those being winning issues for Donald Trump across the swing states.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I'm excited and proud to be from this community, and we're excited to have President Trump here today.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So I got to go hang out with folks in Howell as they were waiting for the president to drive through the motorcade.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's willing to go out and engage with members of the media.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's willing to engage with members of the public.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And so it's a big deal that he endorsed Vice President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The same really isn't true, i mean, you've got all these people who used to work for Trump when he was president, coming out against him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris has not broken with Biden over Israel's conduct of the war.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's still there, will this prevent her from being the next president: i sure hope not, Connell.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I think she's going to win Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I do feel that Kamala Harris will be different.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And you can't vote third party because Kamala Harris has shown her compassion and her empathy here.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's the vice president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's not the president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She doesn't make policy now.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And then on November 6th, you can go right back to pressuring her because you can, you know, pressure her.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"With Donald Trump, forget it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"These are the 2016 margins of victory, the key states, and how many votes Jill Stein got back then when Donald Trump won 50,000, 30,000, almost 50,000 with Michigan being the top at 51-4.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Absolutely, Connell, a vote for Jill Stein is a vote for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Staying home is a vote for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And rightly so, but I think, I hope many people see that voting for Vice President Harris is their best chance to fight on for dignity and justice for Palestinians, bringing the hostages home, having peace between Palestine and Israel, you know, somehow at long last.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Of course, the election is on November 5, and it appears that Donald Trump has turned the dial his way just weeks out from the US election.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Steph, is that the way that you're reading it at the moment, that the dial has turned slightly to Donald Trump: he has certainly made some ground in some of the key battleground states that he would have to win in November to win the electoral college, specifically in Michigan and Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And also the shift from President Biden at the top of the ticket to Vice President Harris at the top of the ticket also means that there are slightly different states at play because of the different appeal that Harris may have compared to Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Now Kamala Harris has been criticized about not doing as many interviews as she possibly could the last week.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's done quite a number.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
You've yet to see a real press conference setting where Harris is willing to take a lot of questions from the media.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's gone on The View.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's gone on Women Focus podcast, but she did do her 60-minute interview as well.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There has been some mixed reviews, one question that I know I've been hearing a lot of concerns over is when she was asked, how would she be different from a Biden administration: she was asked that on The View.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She didn't really have a good answer.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Then she was asked again with Stephen Colbert, how would she be different from Biden: again, she kind of just pushed off the question.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's really what's at stake right now, she is still trying to define herself as a candidate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's very clearly trying to win over moderate voters, trying to move away from her progressive past, but it's still unclear exactly how she views her potential presidency as different from Biden's presidency.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
A continual problem for Donald Trump has been his inability to attack properly the vice president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He still doesn't seem to have got that right at this point.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Amidst all of that, he doesn't want another debate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It was very clear that Harris won that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
It was probably one of her strongest moments since she became the presidential nominee.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
We'll see whether he ends up caving and deciding he wants to kind of go at it again and maybe reclaim some of his debating skills there and try again and convince American people that he's the person they should be voting for.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But it has been very tricky for the former president to find clear ways of attacking Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He has tended to devolve into more personal attacks that have not gone over well, even within his own party.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's we're going to look at, you do have Kamala Harris sitting plus 1.8.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump might only lose the popular vote by around one.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now you're down by 1.8, if the election finished and there was zero error on the popular vote to where Trump lost it by 1.8, that would very likely be an electoral college victory for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He might only lose it this cycle by 21, 22.",Donald Trump,Michigan
There is a potential chance where Kamala could win the popular vote by two and still win the election.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The margins would be very close, but when it comes to the popular vote, you look at the betting right now, it's about a 75 to seven, maybe a 70% chance Harris wins the popular vote.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Like most of Harris's betting numbers have recently, that's the big story.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The polls are getting very, very close, but the betting is what Trump is, is doing really well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I do like where Trump is at this point.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He was up around two points.,Donald Trump,Michigan
This is another state where Trump getting that wall street journal poll really helps him out.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But I do think Trump is probably going to win the state by around point four to point five.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Even if Trump loses it, you're talking about 306 electoral votes versus 312.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If he's able to sweep all the other swing states, it's not that big of a deal.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She was up by around a point for about half a month.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She was leading most of the polls.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But you get that Trump plus six liberals could say, well, that's an outlier.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He ended up only winning by point three.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"When you look at the data, you move on to Michigan, Trump sitting plus point nine.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, look at this, harris was up when they started to really ramp her up and you had the DNC and everything like that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
You're getting Jill Stein possibly helping Trump out Jill Stein winning the Muslim vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan
They've got Trump plus two.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Quinnipiac has Trump plus four.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump won Michigan in 2016.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Pretty crazy there, again, another state where it seems like the data would check out based off of the previous Trump elections to where Trump is sitting in a very, very good spot in Michigan because you could say he's up by a point.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But Trump sitting plus point one, basically 50 50.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, you do have Trump leading three out of the last four polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan
You do have Trump sitting plus point five.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump plus one plus one plus two plus one plus one plus two, so he's leading all these polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So now Trump's sitting plus point five.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I do think Trump is probably you can see Trump was up one point five there.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, some of these polls that had Trump up by four and three got taken out, I guess.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I know Trump recently went ahead.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's basically 50 50, but Trump may be 51.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The polling is checking out, if we went into election night like this, we're looking amazing for our Trump victory.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Amazing, so listen, if they stay relatively the same bunched up like this, it's going to be very, very good for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And he is, I believe, an existential threat to America's labor movement.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They don't want to vote for either, and the other is this group from Yemen who is saying we want to support Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is all about religious freedom, when we talk about the Catholics, the Catholics have not only this week been offended by Kamala Harris, but also by Gretchen Whitmer.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"All this great Kellyanne Conway, former counselor to President Trump, Fox News contributor, my great friend Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor, welcome very much to both of you.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"All she does one attack, vitriolically, Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But those were all Trump accomplishments.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Look, I think she's playing it all wrong.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If I were Kamala Harris, I would have stuck with Biden Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I think at least enough, oh, boy, where's the joy: this person said that she's bringing back joy to politics.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Yeah, it's true, but Trump's got great joy on the job.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Larry and Newt, he's out there every day mixing up with the folks.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump looks like a winner.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump, he looks like a winner.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He wants you to.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He looks like a winner.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's a metaphor for America.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't know if he's a winner.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He looked like a winner on Fox and Friends to Kelly Ann's point.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris looked all crunched up and then got very overexcited waving her arm.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She lost the even keel temperament that you're supposed to have to be a president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think she's not very competent.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But given that, she's probably playing a losing hand about as reasonably as you can play it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So she has one choice, attack Trump, which also doesn't work partially because of what Kelly Ann said, which is sort of like I thought Mike Johnson, the speaker was great on Sunday.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She has a lousy record, a lousy proposal and an incompetent personality.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But we usually go, you know, it's Trump over Hillary.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And here's what works, it gives people a reason and some grace who aren't supposed to be Trump voters to be Trump voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so he doesn't look, i just mentioned groups.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump doesn't need to win 50 percent of any of those groups to be the next president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And part of the message, Larry and Newt, is because he's saying, come along.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's unifying, yeah, you know, he just needs to cut those margins.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Newt, I'm short on time, but I mean, her Kamala Harris's video last night, it was it was an insult to Catholics, but it was an I think it was an insult to everybody.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump triumphs in Michigan, the former president scored a major legal victory after a Michigan appeals court rejected challenges to keep him off the 2024 primary ballot.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump challengers in Michigan and Minnesota hope to convince courts that Trump shouldn't be allowed to be on the ballot.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Charles Rudy Giuliani, is he going to be able to get some legal bills from the Trump political campaign apparatus: i don't speak and have no idea what the financial arrangements may be for Rudy Giuliani.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Later today, Donald Trump is heading to Michigan to hold a rally.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Nationally, a new poll by Arab News and YouGov found that Trump is leading the vice president 45 to 43 percent among Arab Americans.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We have Congressman Rokahana coming through on behalf of Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And I think, you know, we've seen Vice President Harris call for a ceasefire.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
We've seen her do much stronger rhetoric than we've seen this current administration.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"They are so upset with Kamala Harris and just culturally, they have a tough time voting for a woman.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And we're going to lose by less on a lot of these campuses and try to keep Kamala Harris under 20 points.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If she's under a 20 point margin with younger voters, there's almost no path for her to become president.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Okay, so what are you and just FYI Politico did a pair of articles saying that the suburbs, that's the whole deal for her that the pointing out the latest Wall Street Journal poll found Harris leading among suburban voters by seven percentage points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So that's, you know, one would presume that those people would be voting for Trump, but you never know, given his problems with women.",Donald Trump,Michigan
There are a lot of Republican women who are going to vote Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"For sure, so this is Kamala's best hope is that this gap is continuing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"When Kamala Harris was getting a beer with Gretchen Whitmer caught on a hot mic, she's like, we got to do better with men.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That gap can be closed, however, that is Kamala Harris' big play.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I mean, it's not like Donald Trump is running away with it there.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They don't pre-canvas, so on election night, we're actually going to know really well Donald Trump's chances because all the election day votes get counted first.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I think Donald Trump, I'm going to call it right now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think Donald Trump might win Scranton.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I think he might actually win that county.,Donald Trump,Michigan

"Yeah, that's right, we have brand new polling out of critical swing state, and it is bad for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It is that bad, now, I want to be clear that I am not saying for sure that Trump is gonna win Michigan by 15 points, or it's a foregone conclusion Trump's gonna win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, one of the most accurate pollsters out there, and I know some people don't like him, but when you look at his history and his track record, he's pretty damn good.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, he just dropped a Trump plus three and a half out of Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The problem is, well, this is not a Trump plus one.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is not even a Trump plus two, this is Trump plus three and a half.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So when he drops a Trump plus three and a half, this isn't like Rasmussen.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So when he dropped the Trump plus three and a half, you cannot just say, well, it's Richard Barris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump plus two, big data, Trump plus two, but of course it was like it ended up being Trump plus three and a half.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And even if that brings you an impact research, they found it Trump plus one.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump is winning and not just by a point.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's like Trump plus two, Trump plus three, Trump plus four.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, for crying out loud, the clear outlier is National Research, which found Harris plus three.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Everyone else except RaspMuse and funny enough, they have Trump winning by at least one to upwards of four points.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So the fact that Trump is not just barely losing Michigan, no, he's outright winning Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"What do you think is happening in Wisconsin, what do you think is happening in Pennsylvania, do you really think that Trump is up by three and a half to four points in Michigan by losing Pennsylvania, really: listen, if it was a Trump plus one, that's one thing that statistical noise, maybe something crazy happens in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"No, it's Trump plus three to Trump plus four and he's at 48 to 49 percent of vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Big Dad, of Rasmussen, Atlas Intel, they're all showing virtually the same thing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He looked the electoral map.,Donald Trump,Michigan
That's all he needs to win the presidency.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But like I said, if he's really winning Michigan, like this poll shown by four points, in what universe does Trump win Michigan but by some miracle lose Wisconsin or even Pennsylvania, do you really think, or even states like Arizona, do you really think, that Trump would do five points better in Michigan: and I know there is a big X factor in the state we'll get to in a second.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So at the end of the day, he's for sure winning Michigan by fourth.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Hell, he doesn't even need Georgia.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's not like a Trump plus one where you can just ignore it and say, well, yeah, it's Trump plus one, but it's from big data.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's not, and it's only a one point lead that could change next week.",Donald Trump,Michigan
This is Trump plus three and a half.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It could end up being Trump plus four.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But do you really think there's be a four point miss here, especially when every other halfway decent pollster has a Trump lead, did you really think that's going to happen: i don't think so.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's it, everyone else is showing Trump plus two, Trump plus three, Trump plus four.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So how the hell could Trump be doing so good here: all right, because it's a big deal for Trump to win Michigan by four.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So that means if Trump wins Michigan by three or two, he's probably winning Wisconsin by one or two.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't care what unions endorse her.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The people that actually work, they are not supporting Harris at all.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"They outright said Trump is getting like 60 to 70% of the Teamsters support, right: that's what they admitted to.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's a fact, what does Harris have: she has nothing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She has no appeal to these voters at all.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Plus we've seen some big studies from the Teamsters Union, for example, and they outright admit that yeah, like 70% of our own people, they are supporting Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They're showing Harris is getting historically low numbers with union voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's a huge ordeal, but fine, okay, the Union vote, it might shift Republican, but it might not be enough to explain why Trump is doing so good in Michigan because of Trump plus four.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump would have been doing like 20 to 30 points better just with Union voters just to maybe account for a five point shift.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I would argue that the main reason why Trump is doing so much better in Michigan, possibly compared to Wisconsin, is the fact that the war in Israel is having a much bigger impact for Democrats in Michigan compared to say Wisconsin or Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And now some of them, they're openly backing Trump for crying out loud.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, who's a Democrat, by the way, who's also an Arab American, is backing Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, he's endorsing Trump for president and he's outright saying, hey, we may disagree with Trump on a lot of stuff, but we know what we're getting with Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It'd be much more stable than what's happening right now, with Kamala Harris, God knows what you're getting.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Like Jill Stein, you have a bunch of progressive young voters at the University of Michigan not supporting Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
They're not shifting towards Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
They're nearly universally all swinging towards Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"She may not lose by four points, but there's not a single demographic that is critical in Michigan that's actually shifting towards her.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And if that's the case, her pathway to the presidency is all but gone.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Because if we assume Trump's winning North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona, well, Michigan gets him over the top.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If she loses that state, it's all but over.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
This election's all but done if she loses Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's only been a candidate for a little while.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She hasn't risen to a status of an FDR.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And you've got into a bit of a spat with some of the forecasters who working from polls are saying, actually, things look like they're on Trump's side.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Have you had any abuse from Donald Trump for coming out against him this time: no, but I have to tell you, I have never experienced, and I've been doing this, as I told you, since 1982.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I have to say, I attribute this to the toxic politics of violence and disorder promoted by Donald Trump before Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Um, to be honest... Oh, Chompo Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Holy shit, she's probably the lesser of the evil, but, i don't think I'm gonna vote for either one.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Oh, Chompo Harris, for sure, why: i haven't seen you.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump, you wanna know why: because Trump supposed to be the Lord of Texas.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris, why: she just stands for what I believe in.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Stoking anger from Trump and his supporters and, I would say, some objective media watchers, perhaps, like myself.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The only reason that CBS News is declining to fact-check the vice presidential debate is that they're terrified of Trump and his supporters retaliating for being held accountable on the candidates' relentless lying and disinformation.,Donald Trump,Michigan
She was born that way.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, let's start there and then circle back to the debate, so the problem, and I talked about this in my radar last week, is that yes, Kamala Harris is up a little bit in a lot of these states in Michigan and Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And so she's not up by enough, again, if it's the same as now, if the polls are exactly dead on perfectly, they figured out all the kinks and what they're telling you is real, real close to the final, then yeah, she is going to win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But his undercounted by about seven points, anything of even vaguely that scale is going to see him be the next president.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala has tried to reassure this aspect of the base.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I don't know how well she's done at that, because she really hasn't signaled any policy differences whatsoever from Biden.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think she is not the clearest communicator ever.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't think she's a mental fitness.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, there are people doing that, and I'm sure they're saying, ooh, challenge Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They could say, challenge Kamala, here's where.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I would expect that, i wish that they would do that to Kamala Harris a little bit more firmly.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"How does Kamala Harris win Michigan among the tightest of the blue wall states: honestly, three things.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And what people don't know about that is that is a Republican effort, right: one of his attorneys actually was a consultant for Donald Trump, is a member of the Republican National Lawyers Association, is a well-known lawyer in Michigan who advocated against marriage equality, against affirmative action, against abortion rights.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"We know that part of Project 2025, which is the playbook for Donald Trump and the Republicans, is a national abortion ban.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And the mystery is this, when we ask people which issues they care about, which issues are going to be most important to them when they vote, we find Donald Trump by far is viewed as better at handling those issues.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"None some facets of our economic lives like health care, the edge goes to Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"When we ask about does this candidate care about people like you, Kamala Harris has an era lead.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Who has a leadership experience needed for the job: donald Trump has the edge.,Donald Trump,Michigan
There were two assassination attempts on Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"One thing we find when we compare this poll to the last time we tested the swing states when President Biden was at the top of the ticket, Trump had a narrow lead.",Donald Trump,Michigan
What's important though is how much ground Kamala Harris has made up.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Hello everyone, Harry here to talk about revelation of a phone call that includes an audio tape of Trump pressuring two county canvassers from Wayne County where Detroit is located not to do their legal duty under state law and certify the vote in favor of Biden.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So Trump's allegations about hanky-panky were on their face already dubious.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And it's just a vintage, brow-beating Trump call totally of a piece with the recorded call l'or-de-glorÃ©.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And Trump says, yes, we'll take care of that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And Trump himself, not to mention McDaniel, plainly offered an attorney to represent them clearly something of value.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"As Errol Burnett explains, the judge found Trump guilty of violating his gag order.",Donald Trump,Michigan

"He was always trailing and only narrowly lost, and so, you know, I think Trump voters are notoriously hard to poll and get their participation so that you can get an accurate reading.",Donald Trump,Michigan

"So I don't think that that his travails are necessarily going to affect other Republicans for Senate, for Congress, state legislature, governor, et cetera.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I think there's going to be some voters that are looking for an alternative to Biden and they might not find Donald Trump a comfortable home for them.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Clair Shores where four people try to double vote it happens infrequently yeah you know I will I would say those moments that you're talking about happen infrequently but I think this is you know where I find the bigger problem and this is something we've been you know debating for years now we have probably I would say 40% of Americans that do not trust the integrity of our election systems and what we have told those people and listen some of them believe that because Donald Trump made them believe that some of them believe that from some personal experience that they had or their observations of the campaigns but they do it is not healthy for our democracy if we have 40% of our voters 40% of our citizens doubting the system doubting the integrity of the system and what we have told those people is your conspiracy theory theorists and nuts and shut up and then rather than addressing the concerns that they have which would lower the temperature on this whole debate that we've been having now for four years we could actually do some things that everybody agrees should be done and we could alleviate that one would be voter ID I mean it's it's the one thing that would fix a lot of the problems when it comes to people's confidence in the system but you are you should have a voter ID when you go to the polls we should but it is not the law in Michigan and Democrats have fought it 80% of Michiganders support voter ID I've seen this in multiple polls including polls from organizations that don't support voter ID we are told that we can't do voter ID because it's going to suppress the black vote because somehow black people are uniquely incapable of getting voter photo IDs and all the rest of us let's but let me but let me finish go ahead so 58% of black voters support voter ID sure but we still do not do it in fact we're making sure we never do it let's stick back to this six hundred and six thousand people that okay we want it when you mentioned something Jason you said in order for 40% of the people to understand that they shouldn't be vilified for having questions I agree with you and this show that the ethos of the show agrees with you and so because of that I actually had a conversation from my car in a parking lot of my way to work today with Secretary of State Benson asking her the very honest question you're not an insurrectionist or a conspiracy theorist because you have questions about the election the question is why are these six hundred six thousand people on the voter rolls and they're inflated why is that here's what the Secretary of State told us give us the reason why that is in the first place sure why I think and we we tried to make this case to the individual who wrote the article at bridge it's can be complicated and I understand that the bottom line is we have 7.2 million active registered voters in the state of Michigan and we have 7.9 million eligible citizens so it's actually not true to say there are more active registered voters than there are people and the reason why you see a voter registration database that has more records than active voter registration numbers is because once someone becomes ineligible and we know they're ineligible they pass away for example we're able to remove them right away but when someone becomes potentially ineligible like we receive a note that bounces back indicating they might have moved we are not allowed under federal law to remove them immediately we actually have to wait two federal election cycles before we can take that person off the list as a careful measure that the federal law has implemented to protect voters from state officials who would act too fast and remove someone who otherwise is eligible from the voter registration database all right real quickly in what could be the ultimate irony on Elon Musk very platform acts that he posted on where he said that Michigan has more registered voters and eligible citizens his own algorithm fact-checked him on his post and said that there are six hundred six thousand inactive voters it'll be removed by 20 27 and the reason for that is because federal laws require officials to wait to federal elections before removal that answer is not good enough for a lot of people right because it's not true federal law does not supersede state law when it comes to elections but election laws are a primacy no they are not they are absolutely not in fact I talked to the Missouri Secretary of State today Jay Ashcroft asking about what she is saying and he said to me that there is no binding federal law that requires her to do what she's doing and when you look around the 50 states she is one of the only secretaries of state that are claiming this federal law prohibiting her from taking these people off so I go back to what I say about people having questions when they know and she acknowledges that there's ineligible voters but she's gonna wait three years to remove them just doesn't make sense to most normal people and so just do the job I mean this is a woman who twice violated the law in the 2020 election the courts came after the election and admonished her for doing that this is a woman who fought like hell to get Cornell West off the ballot and then a couple weeks later fought like hell to make sure that Robert Kennedy stays on the ballot she's not acting in good faith she's not being an objective administrator of the job of Secretary of State she is a partisan and she is doing things that help Democrat candidates but there is discretion and I understand what you're saying there is discretion for the secretaries of state to actually look at the federal law which does state that you should wait until two federal election cycles not required it doesn't require it I understand that there's discretion there but let's talk about what happens in the places where they don't follow it Indiana and Texas there have been occasions now on several occasions where election officials use DMV records to identify non-citizens many of those non-citizens and became citizens but there wasn't enough time for them to kind of catch up with that and they were taken off the rolls very unfairly in a very undemocratic un-American way and so to wait to federal election officials before removal is to simply safeguard the rights for people to be able to vote is that not as important to those 40% of the people as the rest of them I'm not familiar with with what happened in Texas in Indiana I have no idea what provisional policies they have in place like we do here in Michigan isn't it important to have that time but if you show up in Michigan and you don't you're not registered you can fill out a provisional ballot there are remedies to this but you know we can go find anything we want to justify not taking action but when we have hundreds of thousands of ineligible voters on our rolls when we have a high level of anxiety about the integrity of our process why do we not just do the things that most common-sense people would look at and say well yeah if these people aren't eligible why don't we remove them what we have in Jocelyn Benson is a partisan liberal secretary of state who is making excuses not to do the things that all the other states are doing and I want to talk a little bit about we talked to Secretary Benson a little bit about the issues that they're dealing with on that and let's take a listen to what she said regarding what you're talking about you wish as a local secretary of state in the state of Michigan and it could be quicker maybe just one year or one cycle sure I mean that my job is to follow federal law and so federal law has been well established to have those protections in place so that we don't wrongly move someone off the rolls who actually is eligible to vote and to me that is the most important thing my job is to make sure every eligible citizen in Michigan and only eligible citizens in Michigan are able to vote that's the priority and so whatever we need to do to make sure our roles enable that is priority number one Jason I want to ask you one question do you think there are there are scenarios in place where if this election doesn't go Donald Trump's way how much of a question will those 40% that you spoke of who don't have trust in the system what does the spread have to be for them to believe the 40% who doubt that there's a big difference and I think people have missed it and they missed it in 2022 there are so many eyeballs on this process now from the parties to the candidates to the media to the election supervisors that I think the controversies of 2020 which often involved poorly trained election administrators and poorly trained election observers not understanding what was happening this didn't used to be sexy and 2020 at least made election day and the voting process a little sexier and so I think we now have so many people involved in monitoring this across the board that I think we're going to avoid any controversies there were none in 2022 and they by the way there are polling challengers who obviously who want to go do that job there are availabilities for that so you should always look into that Jason thanks for being here for this honest and good conversation we always appreciate your time next on the pulse we're getting you caught up on some of the stories you might have missed over the weekend including why some metro Detroiters are opting out of political signs next on the pulse this is Detroit's only nightly political talk show focusing on people power and politics you know we say it every week around this time political news never takes a weekend off even though we do so that's why we're here to get you up to speed with everything that happened over the weekend in case you missed it and that includes a major escalation in tensions with the war in Israel because Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's vacation home was targeted in a drone strike the drone did not hit his home but his office is calling it an attempted assassination that drone was one of more than a hundred missiles launched from Lebanon into northern Israel over the weekend turning our attention though back to the US presidential election people in metro Detroit are getting national attention because of what you're not seeing in their yards or on their cars it's actually following a trend we're seeing across the country people are not putting up these political signs because they're worried about how their neighbors or people passing by will react would never put a political sign up on my car or my house ever never doesn't matter nope never would do that that is a level bravery that I do not have yeah I know it's a lot of people say well I'm not putting a sign out about picking neighbors down the street getting mad they'll do this and that so what you have a right to do what you want to do as long as you're not hurting anybody in the process somewhere in that spectrum lies these folks who are supporters but they don't want to be public about it they don't want to take the risk of somebody confronting them or tearing down their lawn signer or whatever might happen again we've talked about this before whether you're a Democrat or Republican or right down the middle everyone should feel safe obviously to express their political opinions but it's also on all of us to make sure that those opinions are shared in a respectful and productive way something we hope to promote on this show each and every night,Donald Trump,Michigan

"As president, she'll fight to lower the cost of health care and elder care for every family.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's lived a life like ours.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She knows us.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Donald Trump doesn't know you at all.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"You think he understands that when your car breaks down, you can't get to work: no.",Donald Trump,Michigan
His first word was probably chauffeur.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"You think he's ever had to take items out of the cart before checking out, hell, you think he's ever been to a grocery store: that's what the chauffeur is for.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But Kamala Harris, she gets us.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She sees us.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She is us.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Former President Donald Trump is being sued by voters in Michigan to prevent him from running for president in 2024.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The lawsuit alleges that Trump violated the 14th Amendment's disqualification clause by calling for an attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The lawsuit, filed by Free Speech for People, argues that Trump's actions on January 6 meet the definition of an insurrection and that he is no longer eligible for public office.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump has denied any wrongdoing and called the lawsuit a witch hunt.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump is in Flint, Michigan tonight where he just finished an event they called a town hall, basically just a hosted rally where he only took heavily curated questions.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But I don't know, despite Michigan going for Trump by just over 10,000 votes in 2016, the state has been arguably one of the most successful areas of Democratic resurgence in the MAGA era, governed now by a Democratic trifecta since the 2022 midterms.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He answered nuclear weapons and then went on a tangent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump, I don't know why he's talking about nuclear weapons when it comes to manufacturing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yes, maybe he's talking about defense sector.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When you actually listen to the words that Donald Trump says, number one, don't make a whole lot of sense, and number two, are never focused on the American people, are never focused on making your life better.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I wonder what it is as they introduce Kamala Harris' running mate to the nation, as he introduces himself, what you want people to know about Tim Walz, other than the flannel shirts, which I understand are real.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
He's as authentic as they come.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And he's like your neighbor.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He's like the guy who, you know, when you move into the neighborhood, he comes over with a plate of cookies for you.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
He had been there a few years before I did.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I can't think of a better breath of fresh air to help make that happen than the selection of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Everything you're about to see is within the margin of error, okay: wall Street Journal has got Trump up two points nationally, 47-45, which pretty much matches what we put out last week at the Fox News Channel 5048.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Reuters has Harris with a three-point advantage here, and USA today has Harris with a one-point lead.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Inside Team Harris' unusual levels of finger pointing, this is a very long article, Tom.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
It has Donald Trump up one point among likely voters 50-49.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So it's a pretty favorable poll for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Your average, real clear, has Trump leading by half a point.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump, what he's doing at these rallies is he gets to this point where he gets like a minute and a half where he says, this is what I'm going to do.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And everything he says is a headline on a policy that he would support.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And obviously the emphasis on being optimistic is important, but he keeps stepping on this.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is the most disciplined campaign his staff has run, but he remains undisciplined.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If the consequences is Trump presidency, so be it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They don't deserve to die like this, that is why we are abandoning Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Kamala Harris has won some support from the community, including an endorsement from MGAG.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But if a protest vote swells at the polls, it could cost her big.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump is seizing that opportunity by actively courting a community he once pushed away.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's having some success.,Donald Trump,Michigan
The mayor of Michigan's Muslim-majority city of Hamtramck has endorsed him.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Local activist Samra Lickman is so angry at the Democrats, she's strategically throwing her support behind Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Our votes are going to be counted, and inshallah, Harris is going to lose because of us.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I've also seen other polling that has President Trump with the small lead, some that shows the vice president with a small lead.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That is until 2016, of course, when Donald Trump won and turned some of those blue states red for the first time since the 1980s.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Effectively, that's the win, assuming all else, but if Donald Trump were to win those three states, his path gets a lot easier because then all he has to do, for example, is win North Carolina, which he did, which he did last time.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And then he goes over 270, and that's just one example.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Look, on the left, Vice President Harris expected to speak any moment now in all-important Oakland County, Michigan, which encompasses much of Detroit's northern suburbs.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Reading now from the Politico piece, quote, a Trump advisor told Shade Room producers that Trump was, quote, exhausted and refusing some interviews, but that could change, end quote, at any time, according to two people familiar with the conversations.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When asked about it by Politico, the Trump campaign called the story, quote, unequivocally falls, as for the vice president who has talked to The Shade Room.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"These are live pictures, he seems just be kind of wandering around the stage waiting for them to fix the problem.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, a month ago, Kamala Harris was up by two points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's up by less than a point.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
The chance that Kamala Harris wins if she wins Michigan is north of 80%.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
The chance that Donald Trump wins the election if he wins in Michigan is north of 90%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Jamal, you heard Vice President Harris once again declining to say what she would have done differently from President Biden.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
This is the third sort of publicly time that she's been asked that question.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Is her answer the right one at this point: you know what, I think it is the right one because the attack on Kamala Harris right now is about comparing past statements to current statements.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What does she believe: if she changes something about what happened with the president, the former, the current I imagine the Republicans will then attack her about that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's on the front foot.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's traveling around the state.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She went here to Lansing and now she's here in Detroit, right: she's been moving across the state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Meredith, it's interesting, on Jamal's point, you know, previously she just wouldn't answer of what made her different from Joe Biden initially and it seemed like that meant there was no difference.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now she's saying, well, this is a loyalty thing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Also, let's just see what if the first person Trump is speaking.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They've got to keep the attention on Trump if they think that she has a chance to win.,Donald Trump,Michigan
The Trump campaign is denying it.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, is that a mistake for him to skip out on multiple interviews with just a little more than two weeks to go: or, you know, I mean, it's not a it's a site that's on Instagram.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Number one, number two, Kamala Harris herself didn't show up for the Chicago Economic Club.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She bailed out on time.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump looks pretty vigorous to me.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't really think he needs to lard up the schedule of his campaign.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. remains on the ballot, and his presence there may be putting some downward pressure on Trump's numbers there.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump is up 12 with men.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Men are tied between the two candidates in Michigan in our poll, whereas Harris has an eight-point advantage with female voters in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris has a three-point edge with women.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And then interestingly, this is Donald Trump's base, Dan, as you know, white, non-college educated voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think these two categories were the point of her closing argument speech last night on the ellipse.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And those categories are working for her, obviously she'd like to see them be even bigger advantages across these three states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And this is Trump's big advantage right now as a characteristic.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris clearly wants to do some work on this score as well.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And you saw her make that implicit comparison.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Then President Trump tweeted, liberate Michigan, and he also targeted you.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Welcome back to today's video, today is Tuesday, October 29th, 2024, and with just seven days out from the 2024 presidential election, a brand new poll released today from Susquehanna University, well known for their Rust Belt polls specific to the state of Pennsylvania, now releasing their poll in the state of Michigan, showing Kamala Harris with a five point advantage across the battleground states, as a number of new polls have come to show Michigan as a state that has increasingly gotten better.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Around September she had a three point lead across the state and this is around the time too that Kamala Harris' odds of winning the presidency were a lot higher than where they were today.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But Michigan has been pretty difficult, might I say, for Donald Trump to win and that does make a difference in how you see a pathway forward for the Republican party in this election.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And looking at the top line data, just really much what we're getting from this point, is that Kamala Harris is doing well amongst independents and Democrats at large.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And so Kamala Harris doing this extensive outreach, I mean, the Michigan campaign, coordinated side from the Democrats, have probably seen nearly $100 million spent on this battleground state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And if Kamala Harris is to win the presidency, the pathway very much does rely on battleground states like Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And should she end up coming to a point where she needs to win a battleground state, if Michigan isn't there, they need to sub that out for a state like Georgia or a state like North Carolina.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But across the rest, Detroit Free Press says that Donald Trump leads by seven.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trafalgar said Trump leads by two.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Emerson said Trump led by three.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Right, the Times, M.R.G., Remington Research, all of them said Donald Trump took the advantage.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Some firms say Kamala Harris leads.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Some firms say Donald Trump leads.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so when you're looking at states like Michigan and you're looking at data points like these, it's all directing in a good sign and a good place for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And when you take a look at the 538 forecast, which gives Donald Trump the upper hand on the presidential forecast, 53 to 46.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But looking to Michigan right now, it very much does seem like Kamala Harris is in a strong enough position where we can say she will probably win that battleground state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And so if it was to move anywhere that was not, it would make sense that it's well within the margin of error should Donald Trump win it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Assuming that happens, Kamala Harris again unlocks other pathways because the interesting thing about Michigan to is likely where Michigan goes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Actually, no, Wisconsin would go to Kamala Harris, but Michigan would go to Kamala Harris, Wisconsin and Michigan together.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If she wins Michigan by 5, she wins the election, right: which is why we're probably not going to see her win by 5.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Because Michigan is a three-point state, Kamala Harris I think does win the election on the backs of Wisconsin, Michigan to Pennsylvania, and it arguably even throw in Nevada.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I don't really feel confident that the former president won't say that already, but I do think we are in a really interesting position where Michigan could give us an earlier answer than we would expect, and also an answer that I think will show Kamala Harris in a good position based on some of these recent data points, which I think is a good sign for the coordinated Democratic effort at large.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Do I think Kamala Harris would win Michigan today: the answer is yes.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Do I think that Donald Trump could win it today: the answer is yes.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Does she have the upper hand, the answer is yes, right: so, Michigan is right now in a position where it could be and likely is becoming the more reliable state for Kamala Harris based on the data points, based on what we've seen thus far.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Michigan's long been America's leader in auto production, and Harris, in front of a Lansing crowd on Friday, argued Trump doesn't have the workers best interest in mind.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He thinks that the value of your work is essentially meaningless.,Donald Trump,Michigan
That's what he's saying to compare it to child's work.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump also went after the vote of auto workers in Detroit on Friday.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Some Michigan voters have been hesitant with the Biden administration's response to the Israel-Hamas war, and Trump is honing in on that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump visited Hamtramik, a Detroit suburb, and got an endorsement from their Yemen board mayor, Amer Ghalet.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Here, Rogers pointed out the support Trump is getting from within Teamsters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, it's going to be really interesting to watch how that works, and Alex, we've seen both the Senate and the presidential candidates visiting off, and Donald Trump was in Detroit last week and actually had some negative things to say about Detroit.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump wasn't the nicest to Detroit a couple weeks ago.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Statements like that, not going to help out Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But, you know, Trump has his own strategies and they've worked for him before.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But let's talk a little bit more about the Senate race.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Is that a warning to Vice President Harris: it could be.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And it's about how President Harris is going to able to overcome this.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That ink pen that President Biden and Vice President Harris used to undo all of those executive orders that kept our nation safe.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Remember, the Biden-Harris administration undid all of the border policies that kept our nation safe.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Stop trying to mix the two, oK, so recently, former President Trump's longest serving chief of staff, General John Kelly, revealed new allegations, including that as President Trump praised Adolf Hitler, he's one of a long list of former Trump aides, including his vice president, who say that Trump is too dangerous to return to power.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Perhaps this is maybe has something to do with him getting fired by President Trump and him using it as a political ploy more than anything else.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, I'm sure he wants Donald Trump to lose the election.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Somebody else who wants Donald Trump to lose the election is former Republican congressman Fred Upton, who represented a district near yours for many years.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Unfortunately, President Vice President Harris talks about what she's going to do, what she's going to do.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I can share with you he has got a tremendous support from the Muslim community.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Oh, absolutely, small business owner Andrew Cingrati backs Trump, too.",Donald Trump,Michigan
How will you feel if Trump doesn't win: i am.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump used Antrim County as an example that the election had been stolen.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump seized on it as an example of widespread election fraud.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"In one Michigan county alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When Donald Trump on January 6th mentioned Antrim County, it was horrifying.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The systemic voter fraud that Donald Trump talks about doesn't exist.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And turned his attention to finding an alternative candidate other than Donald Trump and at the time Joe Biden through a group called No Labels.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It is an unusual and historic twist that both Joe Biden and Donald Trump are basically asking voters to re-elect them.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Only 33 percent of Michiganders believe Donald Trump deserves to be returned to office.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Another 10 percent mention his mental state, donald Trump's high unfavorability rating runs close to 50 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump is going to get the number he gets.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"One for Harris, when Kamala Harris became the nominee for president, we as democrats, his folks with progressive values were able to switch from defense to offense.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Joe Biden beat that by more than three points, conversely, Donald Trump basically stayed the same, flat there at the high 47 percent range.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson was now speaking out about what she had heard Donald Trump had been saying about her as far as her stance when it came to certifying the 2020 election, which of course he still continues to say was stolen from him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, on top of this as well, we all know Trump is endorsing people that are going to continue to push his big lie and continue to say the things we've stolen from him and hopefully replace people like the Secretary of State in Michigan that can certify the reality of these elections.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So he's endorsed this woman.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, so if you want to be endorsed by Donald Trump, just declare you're a public lunatic and she'll be like, great, and say I will lie for you no matter what, whatever heinous plot you're concocting and I hate democracy.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He'll instantly endorse you.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And by the way, he's Donald Trump's vice president.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But why did they get the idea that of all people kill, murder, execute their own vice president: because Trump kept saying, Mike Pence could make all the difference and he's choosing not to.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And he portrayed him as a traitor.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And then he threatens her.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"They're forming mobs outside of people's house where they're armed, right, and then the point where you're like if you're outside somebody's house and you're just having a picnic and you're protesting, right, it's a little bit different if you bring a gun, isn't it, right: it's a little bit different if you're bringing a gun.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Remember, every time Donald Trump talked about the country, the people, the military, the voting, anything.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And he said, they're turning against America, substitute American for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's who he was talking about, and that's why this entire, now, again, also his talk about election fraud and how we need to do something about it separately.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So I think I don't want to take up arms against my fellow American, but I think I might have to.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, Trump didn't physically say that, but his rioters definitely said it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They had the zip ties, they were all ready and they chanted, hang my pants, hang my pants, and Trump, to this day, says they were patriots.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I'm glad to be working with you and other Michigan Republicans to send Kamala Harris to the White House this November.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But with Trump, it became so much more difficult to find compromise across the aisle and solve problems for our constituents.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Our work should be based on civility and good government, not the nasty attacks and hateful rhetoric that Trump represents.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump has said that his actions on that day, jeopardizing the peaceful transfer of power, were totally appropriate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If he loses, he'll spread another big lie.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump does none of that.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Year after year, globalist politicians like Kamala Harris sold you out and let other countries loot and pillage and plunder your wealth.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Kamala Harris is spending Saturday with former first lady Michelle Obama in Kalamazoo, a university town, Western Michigan University.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What does that tell us about who he's trying to motivate: yeah, he's trying to get the the core Republican base of Oakland County that to get them out and get them to vote early.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean he went into Flint, Vehicle City, the birthplace of General Motors and made this message about a month ago.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's continued to talk about it and really rail against electric vehicles and come what he is trying to basically counter and say hey look we want to compete with China.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And just yesterday the mayor of Dearborn came out and said he can't vote for either one of them.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails, he who will claim unchecked and extreme power if he is re-elected.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He who has vowed he will be a dictator on day one.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He who has said he wished he had generals like Hitler's.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump was in Novi on the outskirts of Detroit.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He didn't appear alone, some of the state's Muslim leaders took the stage to say this.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We as Muslims stand with President Trump because he promises peace.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He promises peace, not war.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It was a scene that would have been improbable during Trump's presidency when he enacted a ban blocking immigrants from seven majority Muslim nations.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And Trump said he wanted to send our jobs out of Michigan for a lower paying wage, so we get desperate and beg for our jobs back.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump believes that my family doesn't deserve a livable wage.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris has a history of fighting for the American worker.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris is looking out for us.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I'm Kamala Harris and I approve this message.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"One thing we must acknowledge is that if you look at the polls today, it seems as though Kamala Harris's convention bump has peaked.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
The polls have reversed and it is now Donald Trump who is benefiting from some momentum.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump has gained back half a point.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And we have seen a reversal where Kamala Harris is polling seems to be coming back down.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Donald Trump's is going up concurrently.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris is holding a lead, but it's half a point.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump has a lead.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And right now, the real clear politics map has it as a win for Harris, but barely a win for Harris with only two hundred and seventy three electoral votes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If Michigan were to go Trump, that means that Donald Trump wins.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, of course, there is still very much a possibility that Harris carries Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris has got this.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I'm sorry, these are really wacky people, but that doesn't mean they can't get Trump elected again.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So that's where we are right now, plus one point nine may have been the peak for Kamala Harris that we talked about post convention convention.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's backed off of that lead by about half a point.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
We will examine Trump's incredible surge over the last month.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump's lead would thus grow to 3.4% by incorporating the weighted polling error average of R plus 2.3 into the current real clear polling average, which includes 1.1% to 2.3 of the average polling error.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Applying that 1.7% polling error to Trump's current margin increases his lead to 2.6%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Putting Michigan in the lean Republican category, on our chart, Harris's path to success is dependent on Michigan, as it is often expected of rust belt neighbors Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Losing all three would undoubtedly throw Harris's path to 270 electoral votes off track, starting two states to the west.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Our next state is Minnesota, where real clear polling shows Harris leading her running mate Tim Walz's home state by 4.7% on average over the last four polls, ranging from Harris plus 3 to Harris plus 6 from 49% to 44.3% compared to Biden's 7-point margin four years ago.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris's lead has increased from 8 to 9.3 points.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Although all of these polls have a margin of error, the only one that shows Harris ahead is from less reliable pollster Atlas info which examines prior polling failures.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Historical polling mistake, Trump's lead has risen from 0.5% to precisely 3%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"According to real clear polling, Trump leads by 7.4%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"With two states remaining, Trump surpasses the 270-vote threshold and receives 296 electoral votes, ensuring his win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Let us now head to Virginia, where the most recent poll average shows Harris leading by roughly 6-5 points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Biden trailed Trump here when he was still running.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"After controlling for weighted error, Harris' lead increases slightly from 6 over 4% to 6.5%, despite the very tiny polling flaws.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris, like Michigan and Pennsylvania, has led since late July.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And after that, it shifted just enough to give Donald Trump this narrow, narrow victory, one with 46.1 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They're not angry, and I just am really impressed by the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And I think that's why we're seeing the conversation not necessarily shift from reproductive freedom to freedom writ large, but also shifting to just the threat that Donald Trump poses.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And you have another candidate from the other party who is trying to broaden the tent to the point where, and I'm talking about Vice President Harris, she has been, as much as she has been asking the Democratic base for their votes, she's also asking Republicans for their votes, where she's campaigning with Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and other Republicans to show that if they give her their votes, she is going to be a president for all Americans.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And by the way, we're watching a Harris campaign event that's about to get underway.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"We're seeing on the podium there the governor of Michigan, but there are six Democratic governors on that stage as we await the vice president.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I understand that we do have Von Hilliard now with us who is covering the Trump campaign.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But Donald Trump, as he did this morning while on Fox and Friends, his message veers off course this morning, he suggested, for instance, that Abraham Lincoln was a great president, though he suggested that he should have settled the differences between the union and the Confederacy before the Civil War started.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, of course, there was no follow up question as exactly how he would do that, whether that would mean slavery would still have had to exist as part of this supposed settlement.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But for Donald Trump, he's just over two weeks out here and he has a slate of campaign events in North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan planned.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And the striking thing about this race is Donald Trump's inability to move consistently above 47 percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he won with 46.1 percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He lost with 46.9 percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
President Trump earned his respect.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He was a businessman, and the Black community knew him, but certainly by the ventures that he had as a businessman.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But they also trusted that he would do what he said he would do, make America great again, and provide the resources to the communities, especially communities of color, the unemployment rate, the jobs and opportunities, and he did that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so he has earned the respect, he has a record, for which we can be proud of.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I was paying $1.87 in gas here in Michigan when he left office.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And so we are very proud of him here in Michigan and the work that he's doing.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And we know that he will handle the business of Michigan again.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"U.S. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, they both won the Michigan primaries.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But as it stands right now, this is a potentially disastrous political firestorm that he's facing, but one that at least at this point can still be resolved because there's a fundamental question that the uncommitted supporters have to answer, and that is, what's the plan for November: because if they push too hard on Biden, they could potentially open the door for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Based on history, Trump's history, that is, he would be far worse for Gaza than President Biden.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Okay, Professor Fauntroy, going off that, let's talk about Trump's vulnerabilities.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So what did that tell you: president Trump really does have a high hill to climb.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But it's important for everybody to remember that he lost the general election by close to seven million votes, and it doesn't appear that he's done very much to find those votes anywhere.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Michael, Nikki Haley and others have raised concerns about the age of both Joe Biden and Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And they believe that Kamala Harris, many of them, most of them that we talk to, is the right choice for Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Yeah, you know, and I was just wondering when this, you know, this report out that the Harris campaign may be concerned about whether it can win Michigan or not.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I don't know if you could say that the Trump campaign has been, you know, clear on many issues, this not being one of them.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, a recent national poll puts Kamala Harris' support with the Muslim community at 30%, and that's tied with the percentage of Muslim Americans who say they're planning on voting for Jill Stein and the Green Party, and that number includes Adam.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Do you have a theory on why that support isn't stronger given everything that the Biden Harris administration has done for unions: well, I think at a time, Alex, of massive income and wealth inequality, at a time when 60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck, at a time when we have a broken, very expensive health care system, time when we're the only major country not to provide medical and family leave, at a time when we have more income and wealth inequality than we've ever had.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
It's important to point out how terrible Trump's labor record was and is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump boasts how he didn't want to pay overtime.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He appointed an extremely right wing anti-labor secretary of labor.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And it sort of begs the question, is it something else, is it actually independent of Joe Biden's record: i'm going to just take Harris out of the equation here, given Joe Biden was only getting 50% of their support.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And then you have the filings from this month about who is supporting Trump's candidacy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It's Dick Uline who contributed nearly $50 million to Trump for supporting Super PAC.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Who is standing up and fighting for them: and I think Kamala has got to be strong.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Look, she's brought forth a number of very good ideas.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Housing crisis, she wants about three million units.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump is out there, he has his enemies.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, he is going after undocumented people.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Kamala does that, i think she's going to win a whole lot more working class people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump is ahead by 1.5% but it's still a toss-up.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I mean the fact is is that had Biden been nominated which he was going to be and then resigned it would have gone to Harris and it would have been no controversy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That's I you know what I think people are addressing when they say or at least what these guys are saying is that getting votes is in some manner at the very least a indication to other political players as to where the margin where the power lies and it's not it's not you know this is not a surgical thing right this is all subjective but it is a big subjective measure and I think in the absence of that you know what percentage of Democratic voters let's say like for instance you know just like you can look people are going to look at what you know senators are going to look and say like oh I got I won 60 percent of the vote Harris only won 51 percent of the vote in my state this is all just I'm just you know throwing out numbers to walk you through this and they're going to say like I trust my popularity more than hers and therefore if I my inclination is to do X and hers is to do Y I may be more interested in doing X than Y. I know that I got 75 percent of the Democratic primary vote I don't know how many Democrats are with her if only 51 percent I've got the strength here that I think is is what Stoller was referring to in this instance I think from the perspective of like a Reid Hoffman or something the circumstances where she didn't have to go through a primary and all of a sudden she's the candidate and you just get to go directly to her is you know present some opportunities it presents some opportunities but also I mean depending on who that person is right who Harris is it presents some problems because going through that primary process is where you build up like all right you know I'm getting chits and these I'm gonna call you know these chits in so it's difficult it's it's difficult it's difficult to assess so and that's I guess that's the point one president who gets into office this way might take a tact early on to establish that like look I've got the political power I know you think I may not a different president may handle it differently and create openings it just it it it presents the opportunity for other political power to exert itself without necessarily having the fear of the electorate in the same way so we'll see Cole from Michigan do political mandates come from primaries within political parties I think they do I think they do for to a significant extent you know there's a story we didn't get too deep into it from Vox about how so many of these antitrust people got into the Biden administration and part of that story was like you know what happened during the primaries you know with even with Clinton you know Warren in many respects was a figure who in 2016 delivered or was seen to have delivered many of the Sanders voters to Clinton obviously you know I mean there were other problems with Clinton's running but she had the binder ready of people who were going to be you know in these positions for Clinton and then Clinton didn't make it into office but Warren also had the opportunity to do that with Biden and I would say like these changes aren't happening because of any election outcome but more broader economic trends and say running out of runway for neoliberalism and austerity and like I don't think they'd learned a lesson from 2016 or you know I don't know if there's a lesson to be learned as much as it is like you know you need you go to the power that you need at any given point and post financial crisis yes and more often than not there's more than one option as to where you're going to find that power it's just a question of like what's it going to cost me how invested am I in what I have to give up hey folks don't forget to hit the subscribe button and check out our daily show we do it every day at 12 p.m eastern for about two and a half hours we even take phone calls you should check that out,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Michigan had it tied between Trump and Harris, which is a win for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think the Harris campaign knows it as well.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He, you know, all the polling says he probably has the lowest percent chance to win Michigan out of any of these states because the Pennsylvania polling, it's also got him up by three points in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But that is when it does start to become a little bit of an issue for Trump when it gets that bad.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So this is this a good numbers for Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"They have Trump down by one, but still within the margin that those are good numbers out of Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You'll take that, especially considering how Trump's been polling.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But Trump wins by six, it's not going to happen.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But there's no way Trump's winning by six.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It's like Trump performing 11 points better.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, this is good news for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It is good news for Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"When he had 307 electoral votes, he won all three of those.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Doesn't mean he's going to win, but a little bit of movement here over the last month for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But all of a sudden, the betting markets moved Wisconsin and Michigan to toss up and Pennsylvania into slight Trump edge.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"6 Ray's here, and if you think President Trump's policies on the economy would be better for your family personally for sure A lot of my friends are obviously my age.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So we're a little younger, we've only voted once you know for actually for a president and Trump is kind of all we know and they're kind of chomping Biden.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They're like, well, we were broke with Biden We weren't with Trump what's going on everybody: welcome back to the channel hope balls good wherever you are This is a hilarious video This is what happens when these leftist woke media people get out of their Leftist woke media a little bubble and go actually talk to real people.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's why it's not mentioned, this is social engineering They're gonna act like this never happened But yet if something is convenient for them such as January 6th, they will keep talking about this issue But the economy is so bad and the border is a big problem with people illegally coming into the country We don't know who these people are The average middle-class American doesn't care about January 6th they want to know where their dollars gonna go further and Kamala Harris is quote-unquote opportunity economy.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's not gonna get better for you.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Do you feel like Donald Trump's gonna be better on that issue: based on what we've seen on his first four years.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"In 2016, Donald Trump became the first Republican to win Michigan in 28 years.",Donald Trump,Michigan
while donald trump tried to  clean up a mess after insulting  the state's largest city and  belittling michigan's many  autoworkers.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"it's back up now, now that  harris is the candidate, to  about 43%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"didn't like trump, didn't like  hillary, and we ended up,  michigan in the trump category.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"and you can say to them, yeah,  but you know trump is going to  be a lot worse.",Donald Trump,Michigan
he wouldn't let us travel.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"his stunt pretending like he was working at mcdonald's, it was a  closed mcdonald's.",Donald Trump,Michigan
he's insulting detroit workers  saying a child could do the work that autoworkers do.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"absolutely, and over the weekend, he told  the wives of michigan to get  your fat husbands off the couch.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"oh, he says america, america  is going to end up like detroit.",Donald Trump,Michigan
There she is in Grand Rapids still speaking at a campaign rally there.,Donald Trump,Michigan
A federal judge has unsealed nearly nineteen hundred pages of evidence that Jack Smith is using to prosecute Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's filled with redactions, but it does include social media posts by Trump that prosecutors argue were personal, not part of his official duties as president.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And we'll start with where Harris is right now by going back to the 2020 presidential race won by Joe Biden as his map comes up with 306 electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So if we go to Michigan, you see the Biden margin was at 50.6 to 47.9 statewide over Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Biden has 52, trump is under 46.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But Trump won the Michigan suburbs according to the exit polls.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Recent polling now shows Harris is up among suburban voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Macomb County was in focus for Harris's running mate Tim Walz just above Detroit there.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So it's interesting that Trump goes to inner city Detroit today.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"First, her emphasis on economic recovery and job creation has struck a chord with voters who are still feeling the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Both Michigan and Pennsylvania have significant black and working-class populations, and Harris's policies focusing on racial equity and social justice have helped solidify her support in these communities.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump's campaign will likely double down on its focus on economic issues and border security, two areas where he has maintained a strong base of support.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"For Harris, maintaining her lead in Michigan and Pennsylvania could be the key to securing a Democratic victory and continuing the party's legacy in the White House.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And the latest polls suggest that Kamala Harris may be on the path to making history once again.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris visiting Detroit this week and rolling out a new agenda focused on garnering support from black men.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Let's go, if the election were held today, who would win the election: kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Who thinks Donald Trump would be better for the border: let's face it.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Why is that, what is leading toward more support for him versus any other Republican: my brother is a firm Donald Trump support.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I understand that, are you saying that the brothers that subscribe to Donald Trump, that feel like he would be better, have a slave mentality: many of us do still have a slavery mentality.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The other thing you hear, at least for some of the people that are going to vote for Kamala Harris, is that they want to be a part of the history of the first black woman being a president.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The one guy said about Kamala Harris, I don't have enough information on her stance on immigration.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He goes, look, I don't want to give Donald Trump credit on this.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Maybe he'll come and save if she doesn't change her position.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What is it for Trump: well, I think it's a victory for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Indeed, absolutely, and what sort of Christmas will Mr. Trump be having then, Greg: because he's looking at 2024.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's gotten, I think there's 91 kind of charges against him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"After the raid, up 39, and then he faded again during when DeSantis had the great midterm election, re-election.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump faded, then the indictments came along and he went from being basically tied with Trump to being down 50 as he is now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So I think it really continues to help him.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's perfectly set up now for the primaries with these indictments, with the mugshot, with the raid on Mar-a-Lago.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's on a good day, so the real issue is can anyone else beat him besides Biden: i don't think Biden can beat him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It really was, this man was, he ticked all the boxes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Nobody could say he was a kind of a soft leaning version of Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He certainly was what many would call the full package of Republicanism.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Absolutely, he's more conservative than Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's better at executing than Trump has ever been.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he has a real appeal to the populist wing of the party.,Donald Trump,Michigan
The problem is a lot of those voters are very loyal to President Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And it's really nothing that he's done.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He hasn't really changed his views on anything.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He hasn't really changed his campaign style.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Because this is crucial what is happening here, it is crucial, and of course, one of the theories that would abound is that they were quite happy for Trump to be the nominee.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Therefore these indictments, even if they recognized that it could easily boost support for him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's always had a ceiling on his support.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"There's always only about so far he can go, he's got a very passionate base, but he obviously puts off a lot of people.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's someone who barely knows what day it is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he makes Trump look like a philosopher king by contrast.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I think that's the thing that's always really helped Trump is that the Democrat and the Democratic establishment have been so incredibly complacent about who they put up against him.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Of course, Donald Trump makes a cameo.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Indeed, and the funny thing is he really doesn't look any different.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I know him and Biden are similar ages.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And it's often said Trump's a little overweight.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But actually Trump looks pretty good, yeah, he's high energy.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Correct, he's still running on all charges.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think Trump is 78.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But he's different than Biden.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Who's going to be the next president: oh, Trump's coming back.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Vice President Harris started the morning in Pennsylvania, then on to Michigan for the second of three events today, with former Republican Congresswoman, Liz Cheney, targeting undecided independents and disaffected Republicans.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now Trump won Michigan back in 2016, but lost it narrowly to President Biden four years ago.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Liz Cheney, the former Congresswoman from Wyoming, is gonna be here today, but she also, the Vice President, picked up an endorsement from the daughter of Gerald Ford, Michigan's only president.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump's visit to Grand Rapids marks many firsts.,Donald Trump,Michigan
His first time on the trail is a 2024 Republican presidential nominee.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"His first rally with running mate J.D. Vance and his first rally since the assassination attempt on his life, tonight we have team coverage of the event from both inside and outside of the arena.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump went after Democrats.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he was very critical of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Lots of people in Grand Rapids tonight lining up for blocks to hear former President Trump speak at his first rally back since his assassination attempt.,Donald Trump,Michigan
This is the messages that he shared and what people thought of them.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I've been to like four of his rallies and it's just so inspirational and so patriotic.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Some saying they were excited Trump put so much attention on the state.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Do you think he's going to win the state of Michigan in the election: because we've been so close both times, it's hard to say.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I do believe that he'll get more votes than he did the last two times.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I believe he's going to kill it, he's going to crush it, he's going to win it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's going to win Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump is set to win Michigan in a landslide.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Because I believe Donald Trump is doing very good in the state of Michigan and he has a huge shot of winning it this November.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And when we look at the betting odds map, and no, this is not a prediction, we can see that he is now favored to win the state of Michigan, the most liberal of the Rust Belt Trio.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now he has a sizable chance of winning the state of Michigan because recently, folks, the election has been a nail biter.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And when we look at the aggregate, we see Trump is up by half a percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Just for reference, Clinton was up seven points, seven percent, and Trump won the state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So the fact that Trump is now leading in Michigan and of all the pollsters, look at Quinnipiac.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They've been the least friendly to Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, that's a Trump versus Biden margin before he dropped out.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She said she's always supported Israel at the DNC.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She did not give the Palestinian Americans even a five minute slot at the DNC.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That's how she's treating this voter group.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
These folks are not going to vote for Kamala Harris as she just came out and she said that she wouldn't have done anything different from Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So the fact that she's basically a Joe Biden 2.0 and you have Arab Americans, Muslim Americans coming out, protesting, this is not good in the state of Michigan with less than four weeks to go.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But if they don't come out and vote, Michigan could easily be won by a point or two for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And there Harris only leads by half a percent.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Clinton was leading by six, trump won it by one.",Donald Trump,Michigan
This is huge for Donald Trump and he needs to keep visiting Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He needs to keep the momentum because Democrats don't really believe they're going to win.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Dems with data are extremely bullish on Trump winning.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris may lose six swing states.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"We know that the polls don't mean everything, but Democrats behind closed doors are panicking at the fact that Harris is not a likable candidate and she is not like a Biden.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She doesn't have the Obama nostalgia.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She says she's not different from Biden at all.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And she did it to herself.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I don't feel bad for her at all because she has played both sides just like what Biden has done.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"With Donald Trump, he may support Israel, but you know what you're getting when you vote for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, he's not going to flip flop on the issue.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He is going to support Israel.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump is also doing very well with African American voters.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is terrible news for Kamala Harris, and she's running out of time to make up the margin.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She is almost being locked out of getting 270 electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
You do have the rural part of the state that I think should turn out for president Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And you do have the Detroit area, which has dictated the state's electoral history a lot in the past, but now everything is up in the air and you could see Trump eke out a very narrow victory in the state of Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But let's just say hypothetically that Donald Trump is likely to win Michigan or heavily favored.,Donald Trump,Michigan
That puts him at 250 electoral votes.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump winning Michigan gives him so many options.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So if you combine that with Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, I mean, the road for Trump's victory is endless with those additional 15 electoral votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Let's say Harris holds onto that, and you have Michigan and you have Georgia.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
But solidifying Michigan is a huge deal for President Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump chose JD Vance because he believed he would be a good running mate for the future of the GOP, not just for the 2024 ticket.",Donald Trump,Michigan
That question also stands for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She was sort of thrown into this position, and I don't think that anyone necessarily thinks of her as the next great Democratic Party leader.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"This is fascinating, congresswoman Alyssa Slotkin warning Kamala Harris's underwater in Michigan polls.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What is your internal informal polling telling you when you talk to friends and when you talk to family about the state of play in Michigan: well, I'm surprised that she's just now admitting this because I've been saying this for weeks that Kamala Harris is not going to win Michigan at this point in the race.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And that is the demographic that she is struggling with the most, and apparently the white dudes for Kamala events just aren't cutting it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You go back to 2016, Donald Trump carried the state by about 10,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The chance that Harris wins the election if she loses in Michigan is just 7%.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris is right now showing the poorest showing for any Democrat.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So the bottom line is Dearborn and the Arab Muslim vote very much up for grabs in Michigan, not a good sign for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Why is she ahead: you know, maybe I'm just too stupid and not sophisticated enough to figure this out.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
But I don't think she ought to quit.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think she ought to play through election day.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Well, I'll listen to the segment, it sounds like she should.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
How can Kamala Harris get the support of somebody who thinks that way: so let's back up.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris and Biden are saying we need to get, we need to have a ceasefire, we need to sit down and do that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So I don't know why you would say, we're not gonna vote for the people that actually wanna try to effectuate a very difficult solution to the problem here as opposed to somebody says, I'm just whatever B.B. wants, I'm gonna give him.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
President Trump is just on it.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He knows exactly what he's talking about.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"While Harris has managed to turn around the polls since incumbent Joe Biden's exit, the numbers are still neck and neck.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The poll suggested that Harris was narrowly ahead in Wisconsin and Michigan and tied in five other swing states, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, as well as Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It is important to note that Donald Trump continues to defy all odds, despite his historic status as, quote, being a convicted criminal.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The latest polling confirms that the Republicans are resting their loyalties with him, and he might even be able to convert some independents.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When it comes to the issues on the ballot, Trump is doing exceedingly well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Already, momentum is shifting to his vice president Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
What do you think it is about her: we know that she's a powerhouse speaker.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She has a level of authenticity that you know you don't always see from politicians.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"For weeks, young people have been sharing memes across social media highlighting Harris's speeches and affectations.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She has been the Biden campaign's most effective messenger on the issue of abortion access and reproductive freedom.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's pushing a strong pro-union message, promising jobs for workers without college degrees.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump, on the other hand, promised to boost American auto manufacturing by slapping tariffs on imported vehicles.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's focusing on hamtramck, home to many Arab American voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris didn't ignore this group either.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She acknowledged their struggles with the Israel-Palestine conflict and emphasized diplomacy for peace.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump's appeal: he's targeting those dissatisfied with the current administration's foreign policy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Today, Vice President Harris continues her push in Michigan with a get out the vote rally in Detroit.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Nancy, good morning, good morning, Dana, yeah, Michigan is so central to Harris's chances that she's spending a second straight day in this state today.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Tell him to go and vote for Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
These Harris supporters told us they're doing their part.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump has taken an unusual tack in Michigan lately, dissing the state's largest city twice in the past 10 days.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"On Friday, Harris called that unhinged.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She also seized on a new report claiming Trump had passed on a planned media interview with aides citing exhaustion as the reason.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"If he can't handle the rigors of the campaign trail, is he fit to do the job: trump pushed back right away.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Starting on Monday, Harris will be embarking on a series of moderated conversations with former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
It's a tight race with Trump holding a 2% lead.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump has a slim 3% advantage here.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"She leads comfortably with 61% compared to Trump's 34%, a 27% advantage.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris has a comfortable 9% lead.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
But Donald Trump has been here multiple times.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But a Trump voter is a strong, motivated voter, a mega voter is.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They don'tâ€”you know, a lot of union members believe everything that Donald Trump tells them and it has no idea what the real record is.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You keep trying to talk to people, have them understand that this is that Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
One of the first things he did is to try to do a Muslim ban.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He talks about incarceration camps.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But ladies and gentlemen, we've got another brand new update and Donald Trump has reached an absolute climax.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Look at this lead for Kamala Harris, you can see it down here.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Look at all of this blue, it's collapsed.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's completely collapsed, harris was up by two.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I mean, why are they including a tracking poll into this: it's, if TIPP, you know, they're going to release another poll tomorrow, I would imagine it could be for all we know Trump plus one.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Fox news will as well, maybe Alice Intel will release one final poll, but they've been very consistent with their Trump plus three.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You, I mean, USA today, Harris plus one Emerson Harris plus one, they've got all the States very, very close, but the big thing we're tracking right now real clear politics average.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's not even a plus one plus three plus two plus two plus three, so these leads are looking very, very nice for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump can lose the popular vote by one point and still very easily probably have a 95% chance to win the election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He can lose it by two points and probably still win three points.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The last two election cycles, the liberal cope is well, now they're over correcting and overestimating Trump when, I mean, we've got no factual basis of that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Couple that with Atlas Intel, the most accurate pollster of 2020 and 2022 saying Trump is up by around three.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Their last three polls over the past three months, they've said Trump is up by three.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They are throwing the kitchen sink and more at him.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It's not working and you have the terrible Kamala Harris town hall last night.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's probably not going to affect anything, but you'll look at these numbers and this really is an absolute high for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So it is over a hundred percent, but yeah, Trump's got around an 18%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now he's back up to 62, it ebbs and flows.",Donald Trump,Michigan
There will be people betting on Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
They think she's good value right now.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's fine, it's going to happen, um, but overall, Trump is still the overwhelming favorite in a lot of these States in Georgia, in North Carolina, Arizona, Trump at 71, Nevada, Trump, and now it's up at 63 Michigan and Wisconsin have kind of hovered.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They've kind of gone back down a little bit, but Trump's still the slight favorite there.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But overall, man, I mean, you take a look at this, not these national numbers right now, Trump is on the verge of flipping.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris is very unlikable, now Vance is more like than walls because people think walls is, is, is just, he's the weirdo now walls.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"When she found her footing, she went up by like 1.8, 1.9, and she maintained it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Um, and now it's been completely cut to where it looks like Trump's on the verge of flipping it at this point, uh, which is pretty remarkable.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I believe, yeah, emerson still has Harris plus one.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
They've had Harris plus one for a while.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I don't know what that's about, but they just haven't pulled recently.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"They had a Harris plus four, but either way, again, these numbers look amazing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, you go back to the summer solid six point lead, even when Trump was doing way better than by doing significantly better than Biden, we weren't seeing the same correlation with the Senate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So, while Trump leads in most of these polls, Michigan remains highly competitive, and it could swing either way.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Both of these states are critical to winning the election, and Ohio seems to favor Trump at this stage while Michigan is still a tight battleground.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Two Trump signs on this lawn right here, i'm sure we'll see some more of those.",Donald Trump,Michigan
How do you feel about her chances here: i think her chances are pretty good.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I don't know, i don't agree with what Trump wants.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I would vote probably to bring Trump back and become a Republican because of the different things that have happened while he was president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"President Trump, he's a businessman.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I believe he's better for our country and making sure we come number one.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Both my parents are Trump supporters and they're like, you better vote for him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump came.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"No statistical difference between these candidates, here's how Obama vet and Harris A. David Plouffe puts it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You have to assume that's now a distinct possibility, he says.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And that is where Harris has sent Obama absolutely hammering his successor's mental state there.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
There are questions about his competence.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
The other day he had a town hall meeting.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He decided, no, I'm not gonna answer questions anymore.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Have you noticed what he's like and that he wants unchecked power: harris almost certainly needs Michigan to win.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
You might remember all the way back to 2017 when he back then did an anti-Trump diss and shouted out Obama.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
The news tonight is that he and Obama will appear together at this rally.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He also told his fans, Eminem did, that he was drawing a line against Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Now this Detroit boost would be critical because Harris allies are openly concerned about losing states like Michigan or North Carolina.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump was there today.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"When he's not complaining, he's trying to sell you stuff.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Have you noticed that, who does that: gold sneakers, $100,000 watch, supposed to be Swiss watch, he says, the best watch.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Why are you selling a watch, what are you doing, do you think Donald Trump ever changed his diaper: oh, no.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He'd be like, Jeeves.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Jeeves, change that diaper, tim's got skills, the other day I found out he can take a vintage truck apart and put it back together again.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You think Donald Trump can do that: they say, well, you want to get rid of Obamacare.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"What would you replace it with: he says, well, I've got concepts of a plan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that's something that Detroit native rapper Eminem has done before, literally using a song to give Obama props and draw a line with Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So I'm gonna remind you about the Trump diss track that Eminem did.,Donald Trump,Michigan
That's why he wants us to disband because he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Fuck you, a little blunt vulgarity against Donald Trump by Eminem, that is a style and language Trump can understand.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Thanks very much, i think tonight, really interesting job for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"For a while now to a lot of people, I think she's an idea.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"At the same time, she does have to run a centrist course.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"This election is going to be decided by the middle, and she's got to make sure those centrist hear something that appeals to them.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris is going to have to find a way to thread that needle.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's where she has to stay and she has to appeal, while at the same time showing she understands what is happening to the Palestinian people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She was on The Daily Show.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Tonight she actually takes the stage.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Talk about her presence in all of this and how important we're reminded again of how central Michigan is to this race, right: well, I think one thing everybody should realize right now is that Governor Whitmer is, for lack of a better way to say it, a rock star on the Democratic side.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You watch her appearances throughout the week at those caucuses, those state breakfasts.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She was one of the most sought after people at those caucuses.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think she is speaking tonight and I think that's very interesting because she has an unusual appeal to independent voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She is particularly good at it.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"One of the interesting things also is she is, outside of Robert Kennedy, the most popular politician amongst Kennedy voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I'm going to look for her to make an appeal to those centrists and those Kennedy voters in Michigan here tonight.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And like you heard, Bob, some of those supporters who are likely to lean Democratic are just not satisfied with the position of the Biden and now Harris campaign on those issues.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
They hoped her speech at the convention did some of that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Now listen to one supporter who said that he was going to switch to support Donald Trump instead of supporting Robert F. Kennedy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's supporting Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Very confident, and as we know, this is a critical part of the population that Donald Trump is aiming to court.",Donald Trump,Michigan
One of the things the Trump campaign did this year that I think was very sharp was it wasn't just out about dropping literature and putting up yard signs.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"We're getting to know people at the doors with our Trump Force 47 program where we're talking to people, swing low propensity voters who've never voted before.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So, Levora, meantime, the Cook Poll also shows Harris with a three-point lead in Michigan that is within the margin of error.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So I wonder how you see this race changing since when we last spoke at the DNC for both Harris and your Senate candidate, Alyssa Stockton.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Support for Donald Trump runs high here.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But there's also those who fear what the consequences will be if Trump is not elected.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Before Donald Trump came on the scene, Barack Obama and the Democrats won Michigan handily.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But the key is between 2012 and 2020, the Trump era, the state as a whole got a lot less Democratic.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Who's voting for Kamala Harris here: absolutely, no.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Why are you voting for Donald Trump: because my main goal is to get someone who is actively funding a genocide out of office.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump has said he will reinstate the Muslim ban.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He said that last time.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's said that he wants Netanyahu to finish the job.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump said a lot of things his first time around that terrified me.,Donald Trump,Michigan
The campaign that the Democrats ran was that Donald Trump hates us.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump is definitely bad news for this country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So I would not, with a protest vote, vote for Trump, some would argue that a vote for Jill Stein is a vote for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I will say, as we put the story together, I was hard pressed to find someone who was voting for Kamala Harris in the Lebanese community in Dearborn that would come on camera because of the fear of being targeted if they spoke out publicly about the way in which they wanted to offer their support.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And they compare it to 2016 when folks were voting for Donald Trump at the time of their community, and were not actually vocalizing it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"David Plouffe, who's working for the Harris campaign, says all seven swing states are within one point.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So this may take a while, given the fact that David Plouffe, the senior advisor to the Harris campaign, Sarah says, some of these states are going to be decided by less than a percentage point.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris is now sitting down with NBC for an interview that will air tonight.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She is also, of course, has a CNN town hall tomorrow, 9 p.m. with Anderson Cooper.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I imagine that is what you're gonna see her do.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You noted, I think she's sitting down with Telemundo.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's sitting down with NBC News.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And they want to remind voters of that as they go into the voting booth.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Maybe some among people who identify as Republicans, but certainly among independent voters who have previously voted Republican, mostly on economic issues, but find Trump a threat to their rights, their values, and a receptive to the message that he's a threat to democracy itself.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Doug, to what extent are these, the swing voters, the Haley voters, maybe from the primary, so by the way, weren't all registered Republicans, yeah, look, you're talking about the same subset of voters, right: some of them are registered Republicans, some of them are independent, and they're looking for, as Ron said, that permission structure to vote for Harris, but they also wanna hear from Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Who are you and what do you wanna do: and I think that the real vulnerability for the Harris campaign here is that age-old question of the devil you know versus the devil you don't know.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There's a little town just outside Detroit of about 100,000 people where something very serious actually is happening because while it might seem like Gaza is a long, long way from us here in Michigan, there is one group in this really key swing state that is so upset at the Biden administration's handling of the crisis that they may just deliver this state for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So if there is a big third party result and that leads to Trump winning Michigan and then through that winning the White House, how do you think the community will feel about that: i think they'll be quite happy.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I voted for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So why vote for Donald Trump: i do not forgive the Democrats for allowing this to happen, for funding it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"There's no doubt about that, there is a really strong sense here that Carmilla Harris is simply off the table.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now, that's not going to be true for everyone, she will get some votes in Dearborn amongst the Muslim community.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And it was devastating, it just said, are you better off: vote Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I spent today talking to some auto workers who are going to vote for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But of course, to your point, Matt, we saw Kamala Harris speaking for the administration yesterday following the SINWR death announcement.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She'll be, by the way, headed to Lansing to a GM plant.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Let's first, Joe, take a listen to what Trump had to say at that Alice Smith dinner.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala now sees the benefit of deportation.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She wants to deport people.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's vicious, she wants to deport people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And she wants to start by deporting Brett Baer Fox.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He's much funnier, unscripted, you've got to go for a few rounds at the comedy cellar, you know, anyways, Joe, what did you make of last night: of course, Vice President Harris was not there.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She called out her husband for having an affair, and Tim Walz for not being a real man.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Look, he's leading Kamala Harris among Catholic voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If Donald Trump does not win this election, though, expect him to point back to these numbers to call into question the final result.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump's chances of winning Michigan have increased in the past week.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"As early voting starts on October 26, the momentum is with Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If we look at the changes over the past month, Trump's numbers have slightly decreased.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Looking at favorability ratings, Trump stands at 49% positive and 50% negative, which gives him a net favorability of minus 1%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"On the other hand, Harris has a much higher negative rating at 54%, compared to her 45% positive, which leaves her with a net favorability of minus 9%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"However, Trump's numbers have been improving with a 0.5% increase over the last week and a 1.9% increase since last month.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The Harris campaign has privately expressed concerns about losing Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
This scenario has raised alarms within the Harris camp as the Midwest becomes increasingly competitive.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Additionally, Sky News reports that Arab American voters in Michigan are turning to Donald Trump, viewing him as a wild card candidate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But support for Donald Trump isn't just growing in Michigan because it's spreading across the crucial swing states that will determine the outcome of the 2024 election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
The Economist projections also reflect Trump's improving chances.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris's chances have decreased by 9 points over the past week.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"These national polls and simulations show that Trump's momentum is not limited to Michigan or the swing states, but is reflected in broader national trends and projections.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"We had primary elections and then Vice President Kamala Harris announced her running mate, Tim Waltz, the governor of Minnesota.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, I know that of the group of people she was considering that she had a lot of great choices.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So he's going to be a fantastic Vice President to President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So I was going to support whomever, Vice President Harris picked.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And I want to make sure that we elect President Harris, but also elect a U.S. Senator who's going to work with her, not try to undermine her agenda.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What's it going to take for the Harris and the Waltz ticket to secure Michigan this November, you know, it's not magic, right: it's showing up.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's going to set an agenda that gives everyone opportunity.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And she recognizes how critical the state of Michigan is.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So I anticipate we will see her and her running mate frequently here and we'll be on the ground doing everything we can.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I feel like Donald Trump it would be my vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I feel like he's probably got a better edge.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Now we'll be voting for Kamala Harris for President of the United States.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
There's no question at the very least she will preserve our democracy and that's what this is about.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Vice President Harris, well, she's going to Michigan this week, a lot towards the campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She said to visit Detroit on Tuesday, where she will sit for a live interview with Charlamagne the God on the Breakfast Club.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She'll hit several more cities across the state on Friday before heading back to Detroit on Saturday, when the state kicked off its early voting period.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
They have to see the real Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And we need to make sure that they're hearing Donald Trump talk about internment camps.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But we've got to make sure we're getting into Lansing and Flint, talking to those African-American men over in the Combe County, which Donald Trump is working hard.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I keep saying this, like, Kamala Harris, be Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I'm on the board of the group that Donald Trump spoke to on Thursday.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"What he says is outrageous, but he speaks with passion, and people connect with him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We've got to let her be seen.,Donald Trump,Michigan
People want to know they know her.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I think people miss that Donald Trump's mail was as strong on the ground as it's been, and he's mailing into Democratic areas.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trade again, i'm here, i see Joe Biden have a lot of the same dealings that Donald Trump's talking about on trade.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Why is Michigan a battleground state: trump has cut into a lot of that Democratic support.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And frankly, that's a good question, even before Trump came around, you began to see the Democratic Union vote slipping away a little bit.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But in Michigan last night where Nikki Haley was able to spend some resources, but not as many as she did, like in South Carolina, I've said from the beginning, you need to start seeing President Trump get to 70 to 75%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So on Super Tuesday, that's that key number, and that's about where he got last night.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, at this point I don't see how he does it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But I think what you're finding is the coalition that was built by Joe Biden to defeat Donald Trump four years ago is not tightly knit together.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, Michigan is one of those states that went to Trump in 2016.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They don't want the simple message that Donald Trump is awful, which he is.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We understand what he represents.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And if we recall the 2016 election, it wasn't that Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton by roughly 11000 votes in Michigan in 2016.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so then the question becomes, what if Mr. Trump wins and all the things that you have supported and worked for and care about are undone, how will you answer that: i am doing all that I can to prevent Donald Trump from being reelected.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so if we can uphold that value and heed the concerns of Americans from coast to coast, we can work collectively to rebuild the coalition to prevent the reelection of Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's why you see a muddy draw out from the uncommitted national movement on messaging, because we understand what Donald Trump represents.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And Trump is promising a Michigan miracle if he's elected.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Leaders of the uncommitted national movement announced last week they will not endorse the vice president, but urge their supporters to not vote for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The mayor says he told former President Trump he'd like him to visit Hamtramck, and that he expects the campaign to set up an office in the city to ramp up their ground game over the next six weeks.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They weren't even really, they're practically children when he was president.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But nonetheless, it's a very strong indication that that animus that was supposed to be held by young people versus Donald Trump, I think it's bogus.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If the election were held today, David, Liz, Donald Trump is your 47th president for this reason.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Michigan goes to Donald Trump, he will win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And two groups are going to put him over the line.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"45 point drop, if this holds, you're looking at electoral landslide for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But if you look at polling like the Economist does, every income bracket you go up favors Biden more, and as you go down, it favors Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He is the candidate of the elites, and Trump is definitely the blue collar.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's not a trial, but the move to disqualify Fawny Willis from the trial against Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Roll tape, do you think it started before she hired him, you see that: all right, you could barely hear it, but he said, dang.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Which means, essentially he was set up, he said something that wasn't true.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He finally reads a text that suggests that it's not true, and he has to, it was like, you got me.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And by most accounts, Trump's dysfunction is getting weirder and more repulsive.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's unbelievable, i had to say it, palmer's daughter is telling reporters that Trump's vulgar ramblings were an unfortunate way to remember her dad.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She added her father disliked Trump was appalled by Trump's lack of civility and didn't like it when people were nasty and rude.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But nastiness is Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Get the hell out of here, well, that was the same message a Trump supporter delivered to his McDonald's restaurant customers over the weekend.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The local owner closed the fast food restaurant so he, his staff, Donald Trump and a few Trump supporters could stage this photo op.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She never worked at McDonald's.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She says she did.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That is actually close to 80, clearly though, Donald Trump is trying to deflect perceptions that his age is catching up with him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump reacted by wandering aimlessly around the stage for 16 minutes.,Donald Trump,Michigan
One of them told RSBN that Kamala Harris is not religious and faithful enough.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I think she better get on her hands and her knees and start crying out to the one and true living God because if not, she's gonna meet her maker real quick.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She shouldn't run, this is a man's world.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And that is why that Donald Trump is the one that we need at this moment.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump is needed because our nation should be run like a business and this is a man's country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
That Trump supporter may be correct.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I saw her naked and her breasts were amazing.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Do you think America would let that pass, would more than 40% of the electorate still cast a ballot for a woman candidate who spoke so crudely: and yet for Donald Trump, the vulgar and classist remarks happen literally every day.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Thankfully, polls show a growing number of Americans are sick of Donald Trump, tired of his antics, and see right through the constant stream of staged frauds.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And as we begin this video, even many of the polls are fraudulent, designed by Republicans to depress Harris voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And perhaps set the stage for Donald Trump to claim a rigged election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It's all a Trump sham.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And Donald Trump's impotence cannot be fixed.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"By the way, on top of Donald Trump's juvenile smears and weird antics, he also keeps seething and lashing out.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Another interview, another Trump meltdown, this time, arms folded, Trump lashed out at criticism of his economic plans.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He was requesting songs on little pieces of paper.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It was weird, and he does weird things like this.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Look, we are used to seeing him have a discursive speaking style, but it has gotten more rambling.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The only thing he didn't do was stamp his foot and slam the door on his way out.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He is becoming more the petulant child.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Indeed, i look forward to reading your comments about the latest poll showing Donald Trump shrinking as his dysfunction gets weirder.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, harris has been on kind of a whirlwind tour it seems like.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She has been, hitting places like Grand Rapids, Lansing, Oakland County.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Yeah and her message has been really interesting.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Okay, she went beyond just like your typical pro-union talking points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And not on October 15th, i also say to my colleague who I talk to all the time, you do not want Donald Trump to be president.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Amasa had done this, under a Trump presidency, I'm not sure that he wouldn't have just knew, guys, that it'd be perfectly frank.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If you remember, Donald Trump won Michigan in 2016 by a very slim margin of just 0.23% securing all its electoral votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But in 2020, Joe Biden flipped Michigan with a 2.78% lead over Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Quinnipiac University's fourth poll, conducted from October 3 to 7 among 1,017 likely voters, shows Donald Trump taking the lead.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump leads by four points here.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump won the state by three points.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He over performed by almost 4% in Michigan in 2020.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump over performed by almost 5% according to 270.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now look at their numbers right here, trump is ahead by 0.4%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now let's go look at 538, when we look at Michigan, we can see that Donald Trump performed almost 6% last time.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And currently Harris and their average has a two tenths of a point lead.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's polling lower than what those two did, he's polling higher than he ever did.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And why he's saying it: because he sees what's happening.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Play the clip, okay, the narrative is that Democrats are obsessed with January 6th, but the reality is that Donald Trump is the one who's obsessed with 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Even today, he was on stage in Michigan saying, I won and I won by an even bigger margin than 2016.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Maybe he should be quiet about it, but he can't stop himself, which puts it into the national discourse.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And every time he talks about it, he changes the crowd size.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It's very much like the way he used to do it with his network.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He literally goes up three, $4 billion over a period of less than 15 seconds.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And he does the same thing with all of this.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, first of all, he's never been to Monte Carlo.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I could understand that the guy is obsessed about trying to convince the world that he actually won the 2020 election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's so adamant about this, that even somebody like JD Vance is petrified to say anything that could be deemed opposite to what Trump is saying.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And that's why he screwed up at the debate.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And that's why Tim Walz knew that he couldn't do it.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, he starts talking about teleprompters and so on.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He calls her like Hamala and then tries to make a joke.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"By the way, Jimmy Carter doesn't endorse Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So Kamala, Hamala, i mean, come on, man.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He can't help himself when he loses track because, you know, who needs a teleprompter when you're Donald Trump: you don't need a teleprompter.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Let's try it anyway, i want to see President Trump make a speech tonight.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Okay, first and foremost, I don't know which darling he's talking about because Melania is not even living with him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And the fact that you have all those folks again standing, you know, behind Donald Trump, teamsters for Trump, really, really, I didn't see them applauding when he's talking about overtime.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I want to show you the kid off to Trump's right over Trump's camera right shoulder.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Play that one more time, because that's the same reaction to Trump's stupidity that I have when I'm watching it on television.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And that choice is Harris Waltz 2024.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Make sure you're registered to vote vote dot org and make sure that when you get into that ballot booth and you go ahead and you're filling out your ballot, make sure that you're voting for Harris Waltz 2024.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I was just in Dearborn a few weeks ago after Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And some of the top activists I spoke with talked about that people they know are not going to vote for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Obviously, there's context and different factors for that, but they're not political diehards and they just look at it simply, costs were lower under Trump and I'm tired of the high prices.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I think a lot of times people do forget as they're watching the migration of black and Latino voters to the Republican Party, despite all these claims that Trump has a white supremacist, that these people have the same exact concerns as everybody else, including white ordinary voters, which is they're worried about inflation, they're worried about healthcare costs, they're worried about the economy for their kids.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So I think if this continues, I think it could be the deciding issue, the defining issue that re-elects Trump and defeats Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Congresswoman, Trump was in Detroit this week, more on that in a second, but the vice president will be there next week for an interview.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And this week, Donald Trump warned that the entire country would resemble Detroit if the vice president wins in November.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Of course, he said this while campaigning in Detroit, which offended many Michigan Democrats, including the city's mayor, Mike Duggan, who credited Detroit's turnaround to Trump's replacement by President Biden and Vice President Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"As he tries to win your state, what are your thoughts about Trump's habit of insulting communities like Detroit with large black populations, even when he needs their votes: so, Reverend, I was actually there because I'm on the board of the group that he spoke to.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I think you heard the real Donald Trump on Thursday, and I think he made a serious mistake.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He insulted a lot of us.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump talked to us directly.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And that was one of the reasons Donald Trump was doing better.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump said he would release his medical records two months ago.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So Kamara Harris just got some bad news.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, it's kind of like at this point, every single day, she's getting bad news.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And so what we're going to do is react to this interview and show you additional clips to justify why this is a big problem for her campaign.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's for sure, who's voting for Kamala Harris here: absolutely, no.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Number one, you can tell that the lady asking the questions has Trump derangement syndrome.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Like, oh, Trump is going to enforce a Muslim travel ban.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But hey, I guess that's too much to ask, right: but what's funny is how the voter checked her and said, hey, listen.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Just because you guys say that Trump is a threat to democracy, just because you say I'm supposed to be scared, doesn't mean I'm going to believe it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The only political power they have is their vote, even if it means the rise of Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's extraordinary, i mean, and that part, I mean, we were hearing about the inroads that Tiffany Trump's husband was making in the spring when the uncommitted, the uncommitted, uninstructed movement in a couple of states in Wisconsin and Michigan were such a big deal.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So there is this position that she's in.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now, before I get to showing you the electoral college map and how Michigan could be one of the reasons why she will lose this election, let's take a look at this interview she did right after her rally today.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I think it just kind of justifies why people feel the way that they do towards her.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
People know what they're getting with Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"OK, the good, the bad, all of it, all right, but what they don't know is who Kamala Harris is.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"After every single interview that she's done, all of her rallies, we still don't know Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So I don't see him voting for her.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So if they say Trump is up by three, Trump is more than likely up by three.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So we're going to keep it the way that it is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Right, so if we keep it right here at this point, he would be at 262.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So obviously, if Trump wins Michigan, he's at 277 and he's the next president of the United States.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I'm more likely to believe that Trump should win, but I don't rule out the possibility that he'll lose because it's just like last time around.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I'm definitely doubting Michigan as it pertains to Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So it literally blows up her election chances.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"OK, the bottom line is this, she is not an authentic person.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She is not willing to show us who she really is.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"At the end of the day, people know who Trump is.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They don't know who she is.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And what they do know is not good, which is she shares some level of responsibility as it pertains to how she's handled the Hamas and Israel war even after Biden dropped out.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Their her statements are very canned, they're not relatable.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Is there a difference: she hasn't shown that when they ask her about Joe Biden and how she would be different.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She still gives us canned answers.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris represents the unknown.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now, if we compare that to Donald Trump, people know what they're going to get.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And that is a disaster for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But the margins are so slim, one thing to think about though, look at the three where Harris does have a small, small advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I'm curious because you have been a Donald Trump supporter for a long time.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's now facing Harris, who is very different from Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And to have what Donald Trump and the team have been working on all these months and now have overnight turned over, it seems like he's having a little bit of trying to figure out what approach to use, not attack, but I mean, what approach to use on this.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I will continue to advise President Trump to stick with the message of his policies.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I know he's coming to Flint and I'm hearing I'm hearing West side of the state too, maybe that's correct.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I think the data and evidence that we're seeing is that if you went into that thinking I'm a Harris supporter, you're still a Harris supporter.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If you went to it thinking you're a Trump supporter, you probably think it was a three on one fight between Trump, the moderators and the vice president, right, and then there's the middle, right, and the question about them is, did they watch, and if they did, did they stay up late enough to watch the whole thing, what did they get: apparently, there were like 70 million people watched their war.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And basically endorsed Harris, and I think I heard that something like two point three million people liked what she had to say about this within 30 minutes of this.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, Kamala Harris was seeking the endorsement of Cheney.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
He's done a wonderful job facing this uphill battle.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I don't think there will be, donald Trump never turns away from a debate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He loves the opportunity to show his leadership, his policies, his values and his his approach to leading the nation.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So I would be very eager and excited to see him again.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"This story could not come at a worst time for Harris because Michigan is very tight and the Arab community, the Muslim community here, has influence on the vote.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"How are they going to vote for Trump if that's their basis of resistance: yeah, definitely.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So a segment of the community say we're going to vote for Trump because we want to punish the Democratic administration.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The genocide happened under Biden, the Harris administration, and when I showed them that we can unseat them.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And what happened after that: during Trump, we did not have any war.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"For them, we had less taxes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's every group, they have a different factor why they are voting for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump does not believe, as far as I know, and I haven't heard Republican leadership say that there's any genocide going on other than what the point of ambition was on October 7th.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So he doesn't agree with that point.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"As Harris tours the state, addressing the youth's concerns about climate change, student debt, and jobs, the race grows tighter.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"One thing that we did hear a lot tonight was, why Trump is a horrible president, why we gotta prevent Trump from becoming president again.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I didn't hear dreaming big, i heard why we, so much of the argument is about why we don't want Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Wanting to feel like this is real change, right, when they saw the change from Biden saying, it's going to Kamala Harris, right: i'm not running for reelection.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"They felt reinvigorated and they wanna feel that coming from Kamala Harris as well, Sam.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Politically, Michigan is crucial in this election according to our partners at Decision Desk headquarters, an average of 187 polls show Vice President Harris with a 3% lead.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
You can see 49% say they will vote for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
46% say they will vote for former President Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Look at the results from the past two elections, in 2016, former President Donald Trump won Michigan by just 0.3%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Republican candidates had won that area by double digits, but it's an area where Donald Trump hasn't really connected.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And also we spent a lot of time with Donald Trump for the last year leading when he was facing Joe Biden.,Donald Trump,Michigan
You talk about 99% certainty of what Trump will do.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Just get it done, when you talk about a 99% sort of possibility of knowing what he is up to, doesn't it worry you when you consider voting for Donald Trump and you hear his message on end to Israel at this point: i've heard many things come out of his mouth that were contradictory.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And right now we haven't gotten any specific policies, but he has stated that he wanted to stop the war.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And what I can say is that with 100% certainty, had this had been occurring under the Trump's presidency, we would have seen Democrats stand up and find their moral compass as they did when he moved the embassy.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So even if Trump was to do exactly the same thing that Biden is doing, I have a little bit of hope that perhaps Democrats would find their moral compass and stand up and say that we would need a ceasefire by now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"With certainty, I imagine they would have called for it by now had it been under Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
My only goal is to ensure that people are held accountable for the genocide and that it sends a message to him and any other subsequent president that you will not be rewarded if you do what Biden has done.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And if the election were held today, Harris would win.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"With perhaps only Nevada, Michigan should be the strongest swing state for Vice President Harris among the seven swing states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Starting with Quinnipiac, going all the way back to March for an RV survey, they showed Trump beating Biden 48 to 45.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"A net gain of one point for Trump, so we have pretty consistent polling shifts here not only internally to this poll look but with the previous one we did for Michigan showing between zero and three points gained for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Polling errors also don't really provide any additional explanation with several pollsters showing significant overestimation of Democrats in Michigan between four and six points over the past two cycles including Mitchell Research, N.Y.T. and Emerson, on the other hand, Trafalgar tends to overestimate Trump's support in the state of Michigan, doing so by two points in 2016 and by five in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris started like a woman.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now she's slipping, marcy Paul is nervous.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But with less than a month to go before election day, Harris' honeymoon period in Michigan could be ending, leaving her pathway to victory less certain.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Ms. Paul is among several Democratic organizers and lawmakers in Michigan who say the presidential race here is tighter than expected, even as the Harris campaign appears to be heeding lessons from 2016.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There is no obvious solution for Harris to break ahead, said Michigan State University politics professor Matt Grossman.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris's entrance into the race led to more than 100,000 new volunteers in Michigan, while she has visited Michigan more than any other state besides Pennsylvania, according to her campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump has also made at least a dozen stops in Michigan this year, but some campaign operatives have sounded the alarm that his campaign has let old-fashioned ground game tactics, like door knocking and billboards, slide in several swing states, including Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But Harris is ramping up her campaign visits this week after at least three Michigan Democratic lawmakers warned of slipping support.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"No one operating here on the ground in Michigan should have or would have expected this to be any easier than it has been, she said.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Why wouldn't they be trying to do that: because they don't want Trump to be president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
We're gonna go to bed at midnight and when we wake up they're gonna magically tell us that Kamala won.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
We're gonna show us a chart of the votes and it's gonna look exactly like the one from 2020 where it goes up and then it goes vertical and passes Trump and then it continues to follow the same pattern.,Donald Trump,Michigan
No that's evil shit yeah in Michigan those people deserve to be in prison forever forever forever ever ever that not a year not probation not a fine forever you are fundamentally interfering with other citizens rights in this country and it's damaging the country and because these people don't understand anything other than what the MSM tells them they think they're being patriots they think oh I'm justified in doing this because look how bad this guy is because the media for the last eight years have lied and lied and lied and lied again and made these people believe this dude is the Antichrist and they think they're doing the right thing right dude and to be fair the Democrats they are the Antichrist we've seen that like they hate Christians and that doesn't have nothing to do with what my beliefs are as everything to do with what I have seen happen dude evil people don't sit around and think oh man we're gonna do all this evil shit they sit around and they think oh we're right they're wrong they just don't know any better so we got to do this duty and whatever this thing is is usually a mass violation of their rights this is how leftists think this is how authoritarians think people say oh Trump's an authoritarian no bro signing fucking executive 30 executive orders on day one without passing through Congress that's authoritarian creating a situation where people are forced to take a vaccine or they lose their job that's authoritarian create I was at a company that did that in a scenario where people's votes don't even count and you're willing to ignore a massive part of the population that's authoritarian okay going to wars and spending hundreds of billions of dollars without the approval of the American people that's authoritarian all right so we live in an authoritarian environment already and when they call Trump that it makes me laugh because I'm like dude what do you are you not aware of what's going on here it's not that they aren't aware it's that they think it's okay they think it's justified they think oh this is okay for me to go along with because I'm a patriot I'm saving the I'm saving democracy right right and this is how the Democrats and the media have and the big businesses the big fortune 100 companies have brainwashed a large part of the population to be willing to commit illegal acts and think that it's no big deal it's nobody yeah I mean the manufacturing of the ballots is going on right now and the voter roll count that we just saw in Michigan everybody needs to share this video everybody needs to know that this is happening to the people out there that have been gaslit about being election deniers and you know they hit you with the whole like well there was no evidence or it didn't get to court like the courts turned it down or whatever they want to say here's your evidence be sure to check out Andy for cella he has a very large following I do like any for cella but I normally don't do reaction content to what he does because I don't want to just be like a shoot off of him but this was very very important like this applies to every single American citizen voter fraud in Wisconsin and in Michigan right now as we speak,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Right now, our partners at FiveThirtyEight give Donald Trump a 51% chance of winning the presidency.",Donald Trump,Michigan
You go from that 50-50 race to now Harris having an almost 80% chance of winning.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"North Carolina, which went for Donald Trump once.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Again, that's an 80% Trump chance.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"We know that Harris is gonna do well just like Joe Biden did, but it's right outside of there where the numbers couldn't be important.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris leads by three points, but third-party voters could still play a pivotal role.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris holds a slight lead, but undecided and third-party voters could be the key to victory.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump holds a narrow lead, reflecting a tightly contested race, October 10, 2024.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris leads by three points, but the outcome remains unpredictable.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump leads by two points, but the competition remains fierce.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris holds a narrow two-point lead.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris holds a slight lead, but the significant third party support could swing the outcome.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump holds a two-point lead, making this race competitive.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Pretty solid, right: but hold on, just two days later, on October 9, a Quinnipiac poll flips the script, revealing Trump surging ahead at 51%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump starts with a strong 98 electoral vote basis.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"With the solid states filled in, Harris leads with 157 electoral votes to the 98.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
These states seem not like they might turn come November.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"With 15.9 points, New Jersey's 2020 deep blue state ranked with the current live poll among 400 potential voters showing Harris leading by 12 points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But Harris has entered the race, so she has been able to maintain the difference.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris is still leading, albeit the difference is closed.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
His 16% lead reflects Oklahoma's Republican base.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris consistently edges out with an average three-point lead.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"In fact, since 1992, it has always basically fallen to the Democrats until 2016 and Trump won the state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It holds 15 electoral votes and it is very much key to how Harris gets across the line.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Michigan is much, much closer than probably what was expected, it is still sitting at the moment at a 0.8 to 0.9% swing to Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If you have a run through of the simulator of Michigan, Harris has to retain this state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And if you look again, she wins 7 out of 10 times as she holds Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But Trump, if he was to hold it, actually moves up to 8.5 times out of 10.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Trump wins so, what is it he's going to do that we have not seen already: jill Stein is polling at around 1 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She's not sorry she helped Trump win.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's a significant concern, I think, for the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Donald Trump caused an upset when he took Michigan in 2016 by 11,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And Kamala just got some more devastating news with that Arab vote that we'll tell you about here today.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"We are trying to do our best to stand up to the machine, the mainstream media, the Democrat Party, the Kamala campaign and widespread censorship with this grassroots content and you can support for free just by hitting that red button down below.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Among those that they polled, 42% say that they plan to vote for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
41% say that they plan to vote for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's a big deal, right, and how has Donald Trump responded to that: well, take a look.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But it tells you a lot about how much our politics has changed and largely because of this very effective messaging by Trump that he's going to be the peace candidate.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, Trump saying that he'll stop the war, kind of both sides, find ways, find angles, they can be happy with that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But take a listen to what happened at his rally today.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"As the president said, we just had a positive meeting with President Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I personally believe that God saved his life twice for a reason.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I believe personally that God has saved his life for a reason, which is to save the lives of others.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"We support Donald J. Trump for his commitment to promoting family values and protecting our children's well-being, especially when it comes to curriculums and schools.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We are with President Trump because we want a strong economy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Don't you want that: we are with President Trump to make America great again through peace and justice for all.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Are you ready: the second prediction is Donald J. Trump will be the 47th president of the United States of America.,Donald Trump,Michigan
You have the Arab leaders going out endorsing Trump on stage.,Donald Trump,Michigan
You have the Palestine protester on the same exact day screaming her down at the rally.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, she might have a problem on her hands.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This was 2016, the shock result where Donald Trump came from behind and defeated Hillary Clinton despite losing the popular vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So 2024, why is it being predicted to be such a close, such a tight race: this is the starting point for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So that takes her to 226, so 226 is where Kamala Harris starts election night on.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
What about Donald Trump: donald Trump has a solid safe seats of 188 electoral college votes.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"In 2016, when Trump won, and this was the shock because a Republican had not won those states until 20 years prior to that, when he won Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, these are the so-called blue wall states.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And for Kamala Harris, these three states are must win.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She has to win Wisconsin, she has to win Michigan with 15 electoral college votes, Wisconsin with 10, and Pennsylvania, which is the biggest one with 19 electoral college votes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"These three add up to about 44 electoral college votes and these three are must win for the Democratic nominee because if she doesn't win any one of these states, then she has to win the remaining, which is far tighter.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Donald Trump called me that woman from Michigan as an insult.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"What a Monday surprise, let's start with VP Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's in Michigan today.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
What's her game plan there: you can tell it's still a toss up.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now we know that the Harris campaign has invested significant time, energy and money into visiting college campuses all across the country.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
They really want to energize that vote.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And we know anecdotally that a lot of black voters are saying they are beginning to distance themselves from Kamala Harris and we know that that is such a huge base for the Democratic Party, so hopefully she can win some of those people back.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Yeah, okay, we'll follow her trip closely.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Around 80% of the African Americans here in Michigan vote for the Democratic Party, and many of them fear that if Donald Trump wins this election, the racism and discrimination they face will get worse.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Um, for us as Arizona Republicans to admit the obvious and to start saying the quiet part out loud, which is that our party's nominee is not qualified for office and that we need to vote for the for the adult in the room and that is Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You know, they don't got no whites for Harris and nothing like that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"This is not good, you're doing something wrong, but I mean people just see this shit and if they don't want his ass, what the fuck you gonna do for you, what can Trump do for you: i mean, okay, playing devil's advocate here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, I want to say what she is.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I'm just I'm just like, you know, could this be something that people who who saying not to vote for Kamala Harris is some things they might say.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yes, been switch up all you want to cuz Trump vote and say these motherfuckers assholes these you know what I mean these people are this and that and you talking about that, bro.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The worst thing you could call a motherfucker, but you mad because this lady switching up her accent cuz she go to a different region.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Like straight the **** up, you see what he wanna do.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We don't gotta talk about what he wanna do cuz we already know.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Cuz just imagine if Trump win this ****.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean and even bro, you'd have heard him say it yourself.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"What that mean to you, well, like, why you feel about that since you're gonna say some **** about Harris, how do you feel about him saying that, hey, what you think that mean: oh, well, like I said, I was just being devil's advocate.",Donald Trump,Arizona
even though Trump said he got nothing to do with that.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I think he like like and I just feel like we can't let that happen. ****,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But hey, Republican speaking now against the Republican candidate, man, i mean, **** what did Trump do for your ass though: hey, man, I feel like ain't no president ever agenda is to help black people.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I think Trump go weird because I don't know.,Donald Trump,Arizona
That leads Vice President Harris with 213.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Based on 17 polls, 48% to 47%, it has tightened with the latest poll from Trump-aligned pollster, Fabricio Lee, showing them tied at 48 apiece.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And two of the previous three surveys did show Harris ahead.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The latest polling average via DDHQ though has Harris up 0.7%, based on 9 polls, 48.6%, to 47.9%.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That is another lean Republican rating here on our electoral map, so 11 more electoral votes are added to Trump's column.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That Donald Trump does not represent us.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So January 6th makes Donald Trump absolutely unfit for office.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Single-handedly, Donald Trump single-handedly changed the Republican Party from what it was.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I would say that who Donald Trump character is does not align with the type of person that I want to be as a disciple of Jesus Christ.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's just simply not going to happen under a Trump presidency.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Blessings to you and your family, so reporter went to a recent Kamala Harris rally in Phoenix, Arizona And asked some of her supporters to name one or two of Kamala Harris Accomplishment as VP and this is just amazing today.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"We're trying to find out from the attendees What Kamala Harris's greatest accomplishment has been a VP: i mean, honestly, I'm not too into politics.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Absolutely, being a good person Yeah I mean, she's she's I don't know.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She seems really good for women Harris is there with the energy.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She has a lot of enthusiasm.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Um, Oh, I know she's done some good work with immigration even though they say opposites.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I think it's kind of chaotic, but I am really excited that Kamala is running.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He's on the slander.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's it, that's all he's not talking about what his plans are.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's just slandering at this point, which I don't like that and I really wish that it would be more about what is, what are your plans as a president versus what are you just want to trash talk the next person because we can always say something bad about somebody.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think Kamala Harris and her VP pick are much more hopeful and positive for everybody, so I'm looking forward to November.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's gonna be amazing as our president and our vice president.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
The Trump doesn't have a message.,Donald Trump,Arizona
All he does is talk about himself.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"The Harris actually wants to do something for a country, and I'm excited about them wanting to do something for the people of this country.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Absolutely, absolutely, she can take the state.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Biden took the state, so Harris absolutely can take the state too.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But Donald Trump tanked it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Because you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the border security bill, it is my pledge to you that as President of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Ms Harris's choice of Arizona for her visit was strategic.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I've just been watching her hold a rally here where she promised to take tough action on border security and reducing illegal immigration.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
It was all done by comrade Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"At the same time, she promised a humane approach to the immigration system and talked about a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For years, it's all part of a delicate balance Kamala Harris is trying to tread as she seeks to win the White House with a broad voter coalition.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For all the careful calibration of Kamala Harris' trip here, and the message that she sought to deliver, it may not be enough to sway voters' image of her as someone who can't be trusted on border security.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But unlike Kamala, who always complains and doesn't do anything, I keep saying, why don't you do: i saw Marsha the other day.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Why doesn't she, why didn't she do it four years ago almost?",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"We begin with Vice President Harris sitting down with that interview with CNN alongside her running mate, Governor Tim Walz.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Ben Brown with our ABC15 political team talking to Harris supporters to see if they feel she answered their questions.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris underscored her push to create an opportunity economy through her child tax credit expansion, down payment assistance for first time homebuyers and targeting price gouging.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
While other Harris voters thought the Vice President came off strong and poised.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Specifically when it came to addressing her change and policy stances.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And now she's changed everything.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But as we know, Arizona is a swing state and with immigration and the border at the top of mind for voters, we'll see how this visit impacts the race to presidency reporting from the border in Douglas.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And Donald Trump is named as an unindicted co-conspirator.,Donald Trump,Arizona
That was one of the things as well that the Republican AG who was close to Donald Trump was trying to not investigate this.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And yet he had avoided, he was an unindicted co-conspirator with Jack Smith.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But Chris Mays and her investigative team over the last year and a half, and we've been tracking it on legal AF from the very beginning when she announced she was going to open this investigation, she said, I've waited, I'm paraphrasing, I've waited long enough.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Arizona has been a hotbed of activity, most of it negative about the cling to power by Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"They found that there wasn't even any, we had Rusty Bowers, the Speaker of the House of Arizona, pressured by both Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani, one now indicted Rudy Giuliani, one an unindicted co-conspirator.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"When I'm done, I want to get your view on why Trump was left out of this party that's been arranged.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Rudy Giuliani, no surprise, he made a series of phone calls into Arizona with Donald Trump, including to Rusty Bowers.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He sits at counsel table with Donald Trump and all of his criminal trials.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He hired all of Donald Trump's criminal lawyers.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Lawyers quit Donald Trump defense because of his meddling.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, if I'm thinking, why was Trump an unindicted co-conspirator at this stage: my view is just time will tell if he goes from unindicted to indicted.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I think that this is an approach to put pressure on some of the other indicted co-conspirators now to actually flip on Donald Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think what happened here, Popak, is the Arizona attorney general was observing what was happening when you indict Donald Trump with the others.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So I think tactically you don't include him here yet.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And why in Arizona give any excuse for any of those other ones to be delayed if Donald Trump tries to use Arizona as a delay tactic for some of the other cases where he can be brought to justice.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So Donald Trump is not just not out of the danger zone yet.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He is close to the danger zone.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She'll see what happens with the federal election cases and the Mar-a-Lago case.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Michael Popak, you, I, Dean Adal and our legal team here at the Midas Touch Network and Legal AF will be covering the oral arguments before the United States Supreme Court, where Trump is claiming that he has absolute immunity to order SEAL Team Six to kill his political opponents.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Because when we ask men, what do you think the campaigns are paying attention to, most of them say that the Harris campaign isn't paying enough attention, too little, to the concerns of men.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If we see by contrast Harris building on those margins, then we see that maybe she's got the better chance to win.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So they're all Harris Walls supporters.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"There are some Republicans who think this thing has to burn to the ground and a new party has to emerge and others who think that if Donald Trump loses, they can try to reclaim their party.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I've never got a real balance on where most Republicans who are not voting for Donald Trump feel about that.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Some of this change can be attributed to demographic shifts, while other factors include dissatisfaction with Donald Trump's rhetoric and policies.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, Trump's repeated insults toward McCain have not gone unnoticed by voters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But McCain isn't the only Republican figure that Trump has alienated.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, like other groups within the GOP, many Mormons have become disillusioned with Trump's behavior and rhetoric, which they see as being incompatible with their religious beliefs.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Young women, in particular, have been vocal about their support for the measure, and their votes could make a significant difference in a state that is as closely contested as Arizona dot Arizona's Latino population has long been a crucial part of the state's electorate, and in recent years, there has been a lot of discussion about whether Latino voters are shifting toward more conservative candidates like Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"While some Latino voters may be drawn to Trump's message of economic growth and border security, others are more concerned with issues like healthcare, education, and immigration reform, issues that align more closely with the Democratic Party's platform.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris and the Democrats have recognized the importance of the Latino vote in Arizona and have made concerted efforts to reach out to this community.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"However, it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be enough to counteract the gains that Trump has made with certain segments of the Latino electorate.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump said, let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels at her.",Donald Trump,Arizona
This is what Donald Trump just said.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Play the clip, and I don't blame him for sticking with his daughter, but his daughter is a very dumb individual, very dumb.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, when the guns are trained on her face, you know, how despicable can you get: and I believe that Donald Trump just violated the terms of his relief for the felony charges.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I think that Donald Trump just committed a felony right there.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Also Donald Trump just seems very unwell.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He was making noises throughout the night, just making weird noises while instead of even speaking here, watch.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump continues by calling Adam Schiff a watermelon head.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump's freaking out about the data.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"When Donald Trump talks about a certain pastor who says that he's great, I don't know what he's talking about.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Nice guy from Texas, and he said, you know, Trump may not be the best Christian of all, but he's the only one going to take us to the promised land because he's the best leader and he's the toughest guy and he's going to be able to get us through this crazy life.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And he was a big supporter.,Donald Trump,Arizona
But he said he may not know the Bible quite as well as other people are supposed to.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And the more pressure Kamala, the more pressure Kamala has, the more you see it happening.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
That's Donald Trump's message to women.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He can't even get into a truck.,Donald Trump,Arizona
There's a reason why he's not releasing his medical records anyway.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And her saying, all Donald Trump wants to do is divide us.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's why she's strongly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris and also LeBron James endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris today as well.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
He has consistently worked to divide us.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"At Madison Square Garden, he reminded us who he really is and how he really feels.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"We really need to see what's there needs to be ramifications for what Donald Trump said at the beginning, because I believe that was a felony threat right there.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I don't blame him for sticking with his daughter, but his daughter is a very dumb individual, very dumb.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Let's turn to the 2024 race, you heard President Trump's remarks.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Mr. Speaker, you're crossing all over the country.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's why Kamala Harris herself avoids the question.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I know you wanna talk about policy, and I respect that, but the reason that Donald Trump is not up 10 points is because of comments like that one, where people do have concerns about his fitness, his acuity, and his stability.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I don't wanna be talking about this, donald Trump is out there saying it is- But you continue to, let's talk about- Because you won't address it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Wait a minute, hold on, he won't address it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He is out there talking to voters- No, I'll address it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"When President Trump is at a rally, sometimes he'll speak for two straight hours.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You're questioning his stamina, his mental acuity.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump does.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"There's gonna be, when they count the votes, and they do the math, and they're the side of this, I'm convinced you're gonna have a record number of Hispanic and Latino voters coming into the Republican Party, a record number of black and African American voters, record number of Jewish voters and union workers and hardworking families, because they understand the Harris policies have destroyed their family finances.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So he has fun at the rallies.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He says things that are off the cuff.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We could do that with Kamala Harris after a 20-minute event, because she does word salads, and she couldn't hold court like that without a teleprompter.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Meanwhile, the vice president Kamala Harris, she hopes to strengthen a political weak spot.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump has a slim lead here in Arizona in a poll of likely Arizona voters in a head to head matchup.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Take a listen, donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on and told them to kill the bill.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution because he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.,Donald Trump,Arizona
You will hear Kamala claim that the reason the border is not secure is that Congress has refused to pass her atrocious border bill.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And Harris' visit today will be here in Border Patrol's Tucson, Arizona sector.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It's also a place where our Fox cameras have repeatedly captured scenes like this, border wall breaches and mass illegal crossings over and over.",Donald Trump,Arizona
This is nothing more than for her to check the box.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Where has she been: and back out here live, that is a question the local sheriff out here is wondering as well.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He tells us he personally invited Kamala Harris to come down here, putting that invitation to her through Democrat Arizona Senator Mark Kelly.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris is expected to arrive here later this afternoon.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She will deliver remarks later this afternoon.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
We'll send it back to you.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And we'll see when she takes questions too.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And I know with the speech that she's going to lay out, but we'll see when that develops.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Is there a reason why she would pick that corner of Arizona in Douglas: i asked the sheriff and it's apparently because he personally invited her here.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Expect her to attack Donald Trump today for that bipartisan border deal being killed before it ever got off the ground.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I will launch the largest deportation program in American history in Georgia Wednesday night Trump stepped up his attacks on the vice president and the White House border policies They walked through that open border and probably say man are these people stupid: the Trump campaign is hoping to flip Arizona back to its column after the former president lost the state by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020 Trump will also be in Texas on Friday a senior campaign adviser tell CBS News The former president will join Joe Rogan for an in-person taping in Austin Rogan show the Joe Rogan experience has more than 14 million followers on Spotify and 17 and a half million subscribers on YouTube and on our website We have our voters guide so you can find deadlines to register to vote based on where you live as well as information on early Voting and how to find polling stations.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's gone after one of our favorite sons John McCain on any number of occasions.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, i think there's a lot of people who care deeply about John McCain who thought he was a very good senator for the state of Arizona and they don't like the attitude that Donald Trump has about him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
On the other side of the issue there's a question about immigration on the ballot and immigration is something that is definitely lighting up the supporters of Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
As the two hold a rally in seven battleground states across the country after touching down at Sky Harbor tonight the vice president's motorcade they headed over to the Sheraton in downtown Phoenix the pair are preparing for a big event event tomorrow in Glendale and Fox 10's Nicole Christine was on the tarmac tonight when they arrived she spoke with several Arizona leaders about Harris's visit to Arizona Nicole.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I think that Kamala Harris matches Arizona perfectly.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's a very inspirational person I've got a wonderful background story and very impressive I was today very impressed just by how personable she was how charming she was.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"When evaluating the candidates' issue positions versus their leadership qualities, slightly over half of Arizona voters prioritize issue stances, while Harris supporters tend to emphasize leadership traits more.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris is heading there today, again.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Democrats have traditionally counted on this voting block, but if we can take anything away from recent polling, it's that Harris has work to do to win over more Latinos, specifically male Latinos.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"According to a recent USA Today Suffolk University survey, the GOP nominee is leading among male Latino voters ages 18 to 34, with 51 percent compared to Harris's 33 percent.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris also in Arizona a critical Senate race between the GOP nominee, Kerry Lake and Ruben Gallego, here to break this all down is Cameron Stevenson, the founding editor and chief political correspondent at the Cooper Courier.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And a lot of that has to do with, one, Trump has a strong history here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But it doesn't seem like, from what you say, that's really a plausible scenario at this point: i would be surprised, and only because Donald Trump as a figure is, he's his own person.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He is very much an independent entity.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He voted to support this bipartisan border bill that Donald Trump opposed, Kerry Lake opposed.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We spoke to new Trump supporters at Arizona State.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I like his policy on closed borders and I don't like illegal immigration.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He talks like I talk with my friends.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"If people sit down and actually watch the full long term interview, I think they'll see more kind of who Trump is, kind of not the evil guy that everyone makes him out to be.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump is a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he wrote down that golden escalator nine years ago.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And when he's not complaining, he's trying to sell you stuff.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's got his gold sneakers.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's got the $100,000 watch.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's got – this is my favorite – he's got the Trump Bible.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Wants you to buy the Word of God, Donald Trump edition.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"His name's going to be on there, embossed, right next to Luke and Mark and Matthew.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Where these Bibles are made, so, Mr. Tough Guy on China, except when he can make a few bucks, hawking his Trump edition Bibles.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But he's doing it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And the reason he's doing it is because what he cares about is his ego and his money and his status.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's not thinking about you.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump sees power as nothing more than a means to his ends.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He wants the middle class to pay the price for another huge tax cut that would mostly help him and his country club buddies.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Vote, most of all, most of all, Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them, between the, quote, real Americans, which, by which he means his supporters, and the outsiders who don't support him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Because having people divided and angry and aggrieved and resentful, he figures that boosts his chances to get elected.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, so those are his intentions, i do have to point out that along with his intentions, there is also a question of his competence.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Have you seen him lately: i mean, he is out there, he's given two, two and a half hour speeches, just word salads.",Donald Trump,Arizona
You have no idea what he's talking about.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's talking about Hannibal Lecter.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's talking about this, he's talking about that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He just decided, you know what, I'm going to stop taking questions.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And then he's swaying to Ave Maria and YMCA for about half an hour.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Tucson, we do not need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We are ready for a President Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And the good news is Kamala Harris is ready to do the job.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"This is a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice, who need a champion.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The point is, if you elect Kamala and Tim, they will not be focused on their problems.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
They will be focused on yours.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
They understand that too many folks not just here in Arizona but across the country are still struggling to pay the bills.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump's plan is to give another massive tax cut to billionaires and big corporations.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, some people, because I'm having conversations around the country with folks as I go campaigning, and I'll hear some people say, well, I remember the economy when those first two years with Trump, they were pretty good.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So when I handed over the economy to Donald Trump, we had had 75 straight months of job growth.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And now he wants to do it again.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But this is basically a Trump sales tax that could cost the average family almost $4,000 a year.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If you think prices are high now, Donald Trump's message is, you ain't seen nothing yet.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"When it comes to health care, Donald Trump's got one answer, and that is, and Obamacare.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Get rid of the Affordable Care Act, even though 45 million people rely on it, a couple of weeks ago, his running mate had the nerve, the chutzpah, to say that Donald Trump salvaged the Affordable Care Act.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"What: donald Trump spent his entire presidency trying to dismantle it, and he couldn't even do that right.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Thanks to John McCain, he didn't do it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"When he was asked about it, he said, well, I have a concept of a plan for how I might replace it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"How's that going to go over, if it wouldn't work for you, why should it work for the President of the United States: but the good news is that Kamala Harris does not have concepts of a plan.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She has an actual plan to make her life better.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She wasn't going to let anything stop her from winning as much relief as possible for the families who deserved it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's who she is, that's the kind of President Kamala Harris will be.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"To lower housing costs, Kamala is going to cut red tape and work with state and local governments, as well as the private sector, to build 3 million new homes.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Concrete plans, she'll give first-time homebuyers up to $25,000 to help them with a down payment.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala already worked with Joe Biden to take on the drug companies, bring down the cost of insulin, hearing aids, more than 50 prescription drugs.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And as President Kamala will never stop working to limit out-of-pocket costs and protect your care.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Concrete plans, that's who Kamala is.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
You think Donald Trump's ever changed a diaper: no.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"What is this: if you're starting a small business, Kamala Harris will give you a $50,000 tax credit to help you get it off the ground.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's who Kamala is, that's what she stands for, not concepts of a plan.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He wants you to believe that if you let him round up whoever he wants and ship him out, all your problems will be solved.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But remember, Donald Trump was president for four years.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Because he didn't have a real plan, and he still doesn't.",Donald Trump,Arizona
What he had is talking points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
What he had is a concept of a plan.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He cared more about winning an election than he did to actually solve the problem.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Vote, we do not need a president who's willing to make problems worse to make his politics better.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's what Kamala Harris will do.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And to help her do it, she needs a Senate full of public servants like Ruben Gallego.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"This is the kind of person who's going to help Kamala get stuff done, folks who share our values, and will do whatever they can to move the country forward.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For Donald Trump and his cronies, freedom means that the powerful can do whatever they please.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I'm not sure any American president has ever uttered those words other than Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And it's been fascinating to watch Donald Trump just try to tie himself into a pretzel on this issue, because he sees that what his party has been doing is unpopular.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so when he ran for President the first time, he said he would support punishing women who got an abortion, punishing women.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Then a couple weeks ago, he tells women he'll be their, quote, protector.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I will tell you how he protected you, quote, unquote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He handpicked three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He bragged about it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he's out there saying, well, you know, everyone wanted it this way.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Really: donald Trump may be confused, but let's be clear about what's at stake here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And meanwhile, Donald Trump and his running mate were making up stories, circulating stories about how the Biden administration was withholding aid and not giving it to Republican areas and giving it to undocumented immigrants, just making stuff up.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And because Donald Trump feels like making stuff up, you've got hard work and public servants who cannot do their jobs.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I have to say, I've noticed this, especially with some men who think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down and acting all pretend tough guy, that somehow that's a sign of strength.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If somebody says, well, I'm thinking about voting for Trump because I remember the economy being pretty good, remind them why it was good.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If you say, well, I'm mad about higher prices, you say, well, what is exactly Donald Trump's plan for higher prices: just ask him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if they don't, you tell them he's got concepts of a plan and it don't make sense.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If they're concerned about issues like immigration, ask him, well, what do you think he's going to do: because we know what he did the first time didn't work.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if after you've gone through that and the folks who are unconvinced say, yeah, I don't know, I still like him, then you then I think you have to then say, yeah, but what about character, what about values: because that matters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Get off your coach and what, put down your phone and do what: vote for Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For my friend and your outstanding congressman, Raul Grijalva, for your next member of Congress from the 6th District, Kirsten Engel, for your outstanding next United States Senator, Reuben Galleo, and for the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris, now, before I get going, you guys have to forgive me, because let's face it, I'm a little out of practice.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He's got the Trump Bible.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Wants you to buy the word of God, Donald Trump edition.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"His name is going to be on there, embossed, right next to Luke and Mark and Matthew.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Vote, most of all, most of all, Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them, between the, quote, real Americans, by which he means his supporters, and the outsiders who don't support him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Have you seen him lately: i mean, he is out there.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's given two, two and a half hour speeches, just word salads.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If you think prices are high now, Donald Trump's message is, you ain't seen nothing here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Get rid of the Affordable Care Act, even though 45 million people rely on it, a couple of weeks ago, his running mate had the nerve, the hook spot, to say that Donald Trump salvaged the Affordable Care Act.",Donald Trump,Arizona
What: donald Trump spent his entire presidency trying to dismantle it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And he couldn't even do that right.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And as President, Kamala will never stop working to limit out-of-pocket costs and protect your care.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Jeeves, what is this: if you're starting a small business, Kamala Harris will give you a $50,000 tax credit to help you get it off the ground.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But remember, Donald Trump was President for four years.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And to help her do it, she needs a Senate full of public servants like Reuben Ganeagle.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
This is the kind of person who's going to help Kamala get stuff done.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I will tell you how he protected you, quote-unquote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Remind them why it was good.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"You say, Well, what is exactly Donald Trump's plan for higher prices: just ask him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If they're concerned about issues like immigration, ask him, well, what do you think he's going to do: because we know what he did the first time it didn't work.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Get off your coach and what, put down your vote and do what: vote for Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For my friend and your outstanding congressman, Raul Grijalva, for your next member of Congress from the 6th District, Kirsten Engel, for your outstanding next United States Senator, Ruben Galleo, and for the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris, now, before I get going, you guys have to forgive me.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I'm not that, and the good news is Kamala Harris is ready to do the job.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He's like having Jeeves change his tire.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"The point is, I was just picturing it, The point is, if you elect Kamala and Tim, they will not be focused on their problems, they will be focused on yours.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Haven't done them yet, how's that going to go over, if it wouldn't work for you, why should it work for the President of the United States: but the good news is that Kamala Harris does not have concepts of a plan.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
We do not need a president who's willing to make problems worse to make his politics better.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so when he ran for president the first time, he said he would support punishing women who got an abortion.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Punishing women, then a couple weeks ago, he tells women he'll be their, quote, protector.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He handpicked three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe versus Wade.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"If somebody says, well, I'm thinking about voting for Trump because I remember the economy being pretty good, remind him why it was good.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if they don't, you tell them he's got concepts of a plan.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And right now I do have it tilting towards Donald Trump very, very narrowly, but again, a win for him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So this is 538 forecast right now, as you can see, Donald Trump is favored 54 out of 100 times on the national level.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But then when you go down to Arizona, he is still favored by a pretty decent margin, actually even more than on the national level, 65 out of 100 times, which I think is a pretty large overestimation of him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's about a 4,500 vote win for Donald Trump, about a 0.13% win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So I think this does give Republicans an advantage, and with the border issue being a huge advantage for Trump, I expect him to do very well in the southern part of the state, as you can see improving in places like Cochise, Santa Cruz, and Pima County, as well as improving in Yuma County and Pinal County, which he actually did improve in Yuma County in 2020 from 2016, which is interesting.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But again, this is the marginal map, so pretty good news for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Even polls that have Trump up by nice margins at the state, you know, 34%, they have Ruben Gallego up by double digits.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It's time to put an end to Trump's darkness.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"My friend Kamala will be a great, great, great president!",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She is tough, she has grit.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Kamala stood up to Wall Street and the DeGroote Company.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She will protect abortion access.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She will defend our freedom.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She will save lives.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump wants a national abortion ban.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris will restore those freedoms and protect Roe v. Wade.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump wants another tax giveaway for billionaires.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he wants to implement a bunch of ridiculous tariffs that will jack up costs for Arizona families by $4,000 a year.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And just last week, he said he will torpedo our semiconductor industry here in our state, costing – that will cost Arizona tens of thousands of good-paying jobs.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is going to lower housing costs.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's going to lower the cost of prescription drugs.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she is going to cut taxes for the middle class.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Not for Donald Trump's billionaire friends, donald Trump has never served anyone except for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Kamala Harris has been a prosecutor, attorney general, a senator, and now vice president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And now she is ready to be a president for all of America.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And as Gabby has just said, Kamala Harris is going to make a great president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So one could argue that the voters from the vast reaches of the Navajo Nation, a largely rural, largely desert, thinly occupied non-urban area, could have been the ones who put Biden and Harris over the top four years ago.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So does that mean a vote for Harris now, do you think: well, I mean, based on past history, it most likely does.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So I can recall earlier this year being in Arizona to cover an event that Vice President Harris spoke at before Joe Biden dropped out.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Arizona shares a border with Mexico, former US President Donald Trump and now a candidate keeps talking about mass deportations once he's in office.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Still about 60% or more of Latino voters nationwide and in Arizona are generally considered to be pretty loyal Democratic voters and will probably wind up supporting Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump's remarks were part of his broader campaign strategy to highlight immigration and border security issues, reflecting his previous promise to complete the border wall.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"His rhetoric continues to include strong anti-immigrant sentiments, though studies show that U.S. citizens are more likely to commit crimes than unauthorized immigrants.",Donald Trump,Arizona
There are of course no guarantees that Kamala Harris will be able to do the same this time around as we've been hearing.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now granted, yes, I know those numbers have drastically dropped but many voters still fear that illegal border crossings would only increase if Harris becomes president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Arizona became a hotbed of conspiracy theories after Donald Trump spread those lies about the election being stolen, votes not being correctly counted.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We know that Donald Trump and his supporters and all of the election deniers are latching on to these election fraud lies because they know that they may lose.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And so on both issues actually it's very clear that Kamala Harris is the top candidate.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's Arizona, and while there, Harris picked up a big endorsement.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
89 days to make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are allowing illegal people to come into our country.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The White House released a new memo today, timed to the VP's visit, noting that border crossings are now lower than when Trump left office, thanks to a strict new asylum policy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But at a press conference yesterday, Trump said he would go much farther.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's a Republican but has endorsed Harris and greeted her on the tarmac yesterday.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I haven't heard a clear plan why she's going to do for us, for the community.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Right: if she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her rabbi, her pastor, her imam, but it should not be the government telling her what to do.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And amid the growing wave of more restrictive abortion laws across the country, President Joe Biden is putting blame on his 2024 opponent, former President Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"There's one person responsible for this nightmare, and he's acknowledging, he brags about it, Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"When it comes to abortion, there is one thing Biden and Trump agree on, that it was Trump's appointment of three deeply conservative Supreme Court justices that changed the balance of the court and brought about an end to Roe v. Wade.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And yet polling by CBS News shows only a third of Americans say Trump deserves the blame.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He described the job decision as a miracle.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Maybe it's coming from that Bible he's trying to sell.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I hope that it's gonna be Kamala and Wals.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I think Kamala Harris and her VP pick are much more hopeful and positive for everybody.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Which is I mean just obviously completely the opposite of Trump's campaign.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump doesn't have a message.,Donald Trump,Arizona
The Harris actually wants to do something for a country and I'm excited about them.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Whereas the other people they get nothing and done.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Absolutely, absolutely she can take the state.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So Harris absolutely can take the state too.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I would say Trump, for sure.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I think Trump is better.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"The last time he was in, I thought the economy was a lot better.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Also this hour, new reporting on Trump's efforts to tighten his security ahead of the election and after attempts on his life.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Why: he's asking for access to travel on military aircraft with anti-missile systems instead of on his own plane.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And we begin with Donald Trump's newest efforts to win votes by spreading debunked claims about the actions of undocumented immigrants.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, Alex, Aurora has really been the epicenter of this sort of disinformation campaign we have seen from the former president when it comes to immigration.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's not why he's here, instead, he is here to perpetuate this rhetoric around immigration.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He has been saying for months that Aurora was taken over by Venezuelan gangs.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Alex, just take a listen to part of what Donald Trump said.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She has had them resettled beautifully into your community to prey upon innocent American citizens.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"At one point, he called our country occupied America.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He did announce a new policy for if he was reelected, where he said he would essentially create a federal program that would expedite the process of getting rid of deporting migrant gang members, undocumented migrant gang members.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Again, he is clearly appealing to his base here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, appealing to his base there with a very dark message.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kristen Holmes covering the Trump campaign.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She wrapped up an event in Arizona just a short time ago.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So Eva, how is Harris talking about immigration as she campaigns on the trail: well, Alex, she mostly leans into an enforcement message when she talks about immigration.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris reiterates there was a bipartisan border enforcement bill.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And Alex, we saw the vice president today in Arizona talk about if elected, she would create a bipartisan council of advisors in effort to reach Republicans, a big country over party push from her as well.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Alex, all right, you've been covering the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now, Kamala Harris understands that this is not her best issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And instead of talking about the problem, she is trying to focus more, as Eva was saying, on the solution.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, she understands this isn't her best issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And Donald Trump, on the other hand, is trying to embellish it and make it more of an issue for him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He prefers, it seems to me, to talk about this more than the economy, which is a better issue for him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And Maria Cardona, when you look at the polling numbers, what does it say to you that Trump is seeing some of his best ever figures with Latino voters despite this rhetoric and this disinformation on immigration: look, Alex, I think we need to level set.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump certainly has grown his support among some within the Latino community, but it certainly is not what the media and some others make it out to be.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"She's going to do more, she's going to continue to do more.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's got to do more with Latino men.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They just announced Ombres con Camila, and she's going to continue to reach out to Latino men where they are and talk about the issues that they care about most.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So, no, I don't think he should be criticized for trying to do what's best for his overall party.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So he's picking these little wedge issues, and he knows that there's an opportunity.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But what it's doing, it's not just to advance his political class.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He is putting people's lives at risk when he talks this way.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But he does see that he has the edge when it comes to immigration, unfortunately.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And, you know, this is Donald Trump being Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I don't think it took them five hours to do it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So, you know, I mean, they're they're taking advantage of it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Can I ask Mandela, can you what are your thoughts: because as Gloria just pointed out, Donald Trump made similar comments and lead up to the Milwaukee Convention.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He did make similar comments.,Donald Trump,Arizona

"And actually, there actually been a couple of moments when Trump himself has admitted that he lost by a whisper and then he would walk that back later.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Mandela, there was this long awaited moment on the campaign trail when President Obama would actually start getting out there for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He has been completely against everything that the people that I represented as a state legislator and the communities that I represented as lieutenant governor.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Everything we stand for, everything that would help improve our quality of life he stood for, no less than undermining our democracy itself.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And with Kamala Harris and all her qualifications and achievements, it is unfortunately a little bit harder for her to make the case with just a sliver of men.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So Scott, is this less about Trump and more about those voters staying home: well, I do think the Republicans and the Trump campaign specifically believe they are going to make inroads with a lot of men, male voters of all races, white, black, Hispanic, you name it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And we've never heard Trump insult anyone either.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Republican pollster Sarah Longwell did confirm that to Politico that Trump is making inroads with all male voters across the board.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But as Scott says, I mean, Donald Trump has been going out of his way to appeal to men from Hulk Hogan at the convention to, you know, to young men.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I think what Obama was doing and yeah, he was a little scolding about it.",Donald Trump,Arizona

We we now are reporting that the Iranians seem to have some sort of hit list against some of his former members of his administration.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We should take that seriously, and that requires activities by the Trump campaign to respond to the increased risk environment.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He doesn't like that, he wants a bigger rally.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He wants outdoor rallies.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"This is this is this is a danger, i'm saying this because it's dangerous for Trump, not because I think he's doing it politically dangerous for him.",Donald Trump,Arizona

"Oh, wait, do you mean that Donald Trump: because I don't know if you know, but there are two of them, of course, that would conceivably be even worse.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Votes, that's a terrifying moment despite the fact that Trump turns into Professor Freak at the end of that sentence.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And the reality is, is that what President Trump did when these charges related to handling the documents and obstruction of justice.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But Trump never prosecuted it, did he: yeah, no, he didn't.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And one thing that I keep thinking of is a former president, President Trump still has Secret Service protection.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, the accusation is that Trump had this stuff laying around all over the place.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Really: yes, yes, so how do we know exactly what he held, what he had, what he showed them, what he didn't show them: but remember, to be convicted, and there's 31 counts of this, Nigel.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So if I were his defense attorney, I'd be like, no, no, he was the former president.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He was authorized to have them.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And this is what they say, that when Trump was pulled up on this, he surrendered some of the documents, but not all.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so I think this is an issue that the Trump defense team is really going to have to address, because I do think this is one where they're going to have to explain what they did, why they did it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Tomorrow is a huge day for the Kamala Harris campaign.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Some local high-profile Republicans are calling on voters to make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States for a simple reason.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Arizonans are rejecting Donald Trump and his failed leadership.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Another Trump term with JD Vance would be far worse and would lead our country down a path that I don't think we could ever recover from.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Mayor Giles believes that Harris will advocate for middle class Americans, make sure billionaires pay their share of taxes and secure the southern border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona

"All right, Troy, thank you, and meanwhile, the Trump force 47 is launching in Arizona with the grand opening of a new office in Phoenix.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Now this group is run by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.,Donald Trump,Arizona
It says it's designed to make it easier for people who support Mr. Trump to volunteer to help his campaign.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So when this headline ran across my desk, I guess, when I ran across the headline yesterday from the Arizona Central, that grand jury indicts fake electors who falsely certified Donald Trump as 2020 winner in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, this doesn't necessarily name him as an indicted individual, but this is the first step.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"A grand jury has charged 11 Arizona Republicans and top aides, seven top aides, to Donald Trump in a scheme to keep Trump in the White House by falsely certifying he won the state in 2020.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He alleges the slate of Republicans, sometimes known as fake electors, and the Trump aides engaged in a conspiracy aimed at quote, preventing the lawful transfer of the presidency of the United States, keeping President Donald J. Trump in office against the will of the Arizona voters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The names of the seven Trump allies are redacted from the indictment, meaning they have not yet been served notice on these charges.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, lawyers Jenna Ellis and Christina Bob, and Trump advisors Bortz Epstein and Michael Roman, now, this is big for a number of different reasons.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And Mark Meadows, the missing Mark Meadows, where's he, what's he been doing: these are questions.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Moving on here, trump himself, according to the document, is unindicted co-conspirator number one.",Donald Trump,Arizona
They had lots of President Trump flags.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They were very pro-President Trump supporters who were here demanding that the votes get counted.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, Daniel Miller is live in Glendale with more on the event featuring former President Donald Trump at Desert Diamond Arena tonight.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So I'm going to toss things over to Danielle Miller, who has the details about Trump's whereabouts today.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The former president Donald Trump is going to be on stage with the conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So Carlson has been hosting a series of live events, but it's the first time the former president has appeared with him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Not to mention the mega event where we have personalities like former President Donald Trump as well as Tucker Carlson.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Obviously, things have really changed and not changed, so both polls, we had Trump ahead.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So right now, 92% of the vote is going, of Trump's vote is among Republicans.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And Harris is getting 92% of Democratic votes.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So definitely we're seeing Harris have an advantage among women.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So Harris is getting the women vote by six points.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump's getting the men vote by 11 points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So Trump is winning the much larger voters who don't have a college degree.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's winning them by 16 points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so if I'm the Harris campaign, I need to make inroads into this economic issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You know, whether it's on Social Security, whether it's on caregiving, I noticed she had a big, you know, proposal on caregiving, have Medicare cover in-home care.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And so I think it's smart on the Harris's campaign's part to be leaning into this idea of how do we take care of our older parents.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump's winning Arizona right now slightly.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's a toss up, but he's still winning and she's losing by almost double digits.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Harris's approval as vice president is 44 percent.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And that's that's a weight around, you know, the Biden Harris administration right now, for sure.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's she's behind by two points.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And so Harris does have the opportunity to win this state.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She needs to narrow that gap and Trump needs to keep her from doing that.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So friends, we just learned that the Arizona state grand jury that indicted Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, and 16 others for being part of Donald Trump's scheme to try to overturn the 2020 election results in Arizona, that grand jury wanted to indict Donald Trump too, but the Arizona state prosecutors told the grand jury no: let's talk about that because justice matters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It turns out the state grand jury out in Arizona that was investigating the crimes of Trump and company, crimes designed to interfere with the election results in Arizona, that grand jury wanted to indict Donald Trump for his alleged election interference crimes, but the state prosecutors in Arizona told the grand jury to stand down, told them no, told them not to indict Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"This from CNN, headline, Arizona grand jurors wanted to indict Trump, prosecutors urged them not to.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That article begins, members of the grand jury in Arizona that indicted 18 allies of Donald Trump earlier this year for their alleged roles in attempting to overturn the 2020 election had also expressed interest in charging the former president according to a new court filing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Prosecutors cited two primary reasons for why the grand jury should not charge Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
The prosecutors make recommendations but it really is in the hands of the grand jury and reportedly the Arizona grand jury wanted to indict Donald Trump based on the evidence that was presented to them by the prosecutors.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So yes Donald Trump is charged federally in DC for any number of crimes designed to overturn the 2020 election results but you know the Arizona state court prosecutors and the people of Arizona have a right to see Donald Trump held accountable for his violation of Arizona state laws including election laws.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So that policy does not prohibit the state from bringing charges that violate Arizona state law and the grand jury wanted to bring those charges but that's another reason that the article reports the prosecutors told the grand jurors well there's this policy of not double charging even though let me add parenthetically double charging is okay it doesn't violate the double jeopardy clause because you can prosecute somebody for committing let me give you a concrete example I had a case involving a murder of a federal task force officer that's a federal crime if you murder a federal officer we have federal jurisdiction for that murder and we brought a federal case but anytime you kill another human being whether a federal officer or not it also violates state murder laws so that defendant could have been tried in both federal court for murdering a federal task force officer and state court for committing murder in violation of state laws so even though there is this policy that policy doesn't persuade me that that's why Arizona told the grand jurors no no no don't charge Donald Trump here is the third point I want to discuss and this is the one that I think may actually have driven the decision of the prosecutors to tell the grand jurors hold up not yet remember where we put a pin in the article we read the prosecutors told the grand jurors we're not sure that we have enough to prosecute Trump to indict Trump at this moment aha who were some of the other defendants that the grand jury did indict Mark Meadows Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis another one of Donald Trump's dirty lawyers and what did we learn in recent days Jenna Ellis has flipped and agreed to cooperate with Arizona state prosecutors and testify truthfully fully and accurately against Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows and all of the other remaining defendants in the Arizona case so might the prosecutors now believe they have enough to indict Donald Trump based on whatever it is Jenna Ellis provided the prosecutors by way of incriminating evidence about the other defendants and you may recall Jenna Ellis got what I would call a sweetheart deal prosecutors said if you testify truthfully and she sat down with them and told them all of the evidence she could provide and they recorded that conversation with her and her lawyer to lock in the evidence that she said she could provide they said we're gonna strike a deal with you that's basically a non-prosecution agreement we're gonna get rid of the pending charges against you because she was indicted if you testify truthfully against the other defendants so I suspect she's got some pretty darn important and incriminating evidence against the bigger criminal fish like Giuliani and Meadows and Trump so might the prosecutors now believe they have enough to indict Donald Trump even if there was some concern back when the grand jurors wanted to indict Trump initially but the prosecutor said hold up hold off not sure we have enough at this moment well maybe the moment has come and if they now have enough evidence to charge Donald Trump he should be indicted because justice matters friends as always please stay safe please stay tuned and I look forward to talking with you all again tomorrow,Donald Trump,Arizona
"On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the... Hey guys, you know what: here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And this time his plan is a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Clothes, food, toys, cell phones, a Trump sales tax according to the economist would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year.",Donald Trump,Arizona

I felt it myself Fill up gas on the way over here And by the way Chandler's got an amazing steakhouse right here these these steakhouse They've got an amazing they got an amazing Indian food place to call the Fargi Gaga.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Let's see, real clear politics, they've got Trump up by one point.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Which, let's be real, that's basically a tie at this stage.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Basically, yeah, and then 538, they give him a little bit more of an edge, a two-point lead.",Donald Trump,Arizona
They actually have Harris ahead by two points as well.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So like, what do we even do with all that, honestly, it's enough to make your head spin, right: and then you've got the NYTC on a poll, that one showing Trump with a five-point lead.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, take Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He went on that Dave Ramsey show.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Oh, yeah, the finance guy, exactly, the personal finance guru, so smart move, right: he's speaking directly to those anxieties about the economy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And he's reaching an audience that really cares about things like budgeting and saving.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But Harris, she did something completely different, didn't she: yeah, totally different vibe.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She went on that Call Her Daddy podcast.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump is sticking to his guns, going hard on that whole border security message.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But Harris, she's trying to strike a different tone.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump, he hasn't really focused on water that much.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris though, she's been talking about it.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
We need to get people out to vote for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I know there are some women that say, I don't know, I just can't vote for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
They are undermining us as parents.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"This is what we're up against, and for people who say, I don't know, I don't know if I can vote for Donald Trump, the one thing that you cannot question is his children.",Donald Trump,Arizona
His children love him and honor him.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I'm joyfully, genuinely excited to vote for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
The circle next to his name will not get filled in.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"There's always a chance for him to meet Jesus, but I do not know if he will have that come-to-Jesus moment.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's not conservative, he's not stable.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I feel like Kamala, you know, where I look and say, well, you know, it seems stable.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You don't feel safe, i really don't, physically safe, why: because the level of vitriol and the level of emotion that these people that hold these seats with us have towards us for not supporting Trump, it's emotional and it's physical.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So Lisa was always voting Democrat this time as a protest against Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
But then came the Trump-Harris head-on and that sealed the deal.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
But that debate... Was it the debate that won you over: that's what I saw of Kamala Harris that I had never knew existed.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Sam saw that too, but she hasn't forgotten her roots.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now she's so anti-Trump, Sam even agreed to introduce the vice president on a recent trip to Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I'm excited about Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
That Harris is cleverly using to target Republican women just like them.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I really cannot say that about Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"It is the hardest presidential race I'll be voting in, even though I find him so repulsive and can't vote for him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So, for example, one of the things that was reported today was that Mr. Trump's former President Trump's lawyer said, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Mr. Trump is very much like me, a father and a husband.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now we're joined by John Giles, Republican mayor of Mesa, Arizona, who endorsed Kamala Harris and is speaking tonight.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But at the same time, we've seen Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We're well aware of his faults and many of us have concluded that he is ineligible to be the president of the United States.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made before I became when I became our nominee.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She'll be a president we can all be proud of.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she will be an historic president who puts her stamp on America's future.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, she does come.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She came to the to the office of vice president with a reputation of being a fairly progressive senator.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I think that was probably fair, but I've seen her evolve over the last four years.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's had this amazing on the job experience with Joe Biden.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And we've seen that the Biden Harris administration be a very centrist administration.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They've accomplished some amazing bipartisan legislation through Congress, things like the chips act, the bipartisan Infrastructure Act, the inflation reduction reduction act.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So I think she is going to govern from a centrist position.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Your thoughts, Joy: absolutely, well, I mean, it is remarkable, Ari and Mayor Giles, to see so many Republicans being willing to come forward and not just say we reject Donald Trump, but to say we actually affirmatively support Vice President Harris, which is a different thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Michael Steele is a dear friend and others who I know their values don't align with Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He loses Republicans elections.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, we've seen all the Senate Republicans that when they were initially giving their thoughts about Donald Trump, couldn't have been more condemning.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And as far as his character and their predictions for a total failure and the loss of the soul of the Republican Party, if they were elected, you've seen all those things come to pass.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But again, they step up and defend him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So you can only conclude that, you know, the political price to be paid for crossing Donald Trump is the end of your.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And what that used to mean to you, donald Trump is defeated and there's a chance to rebuild the Republican Party.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The list includes Trump's fake electors, some of his closest allies, so 11 are fraudulent electors.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She was the chairperson for Trump's Arizona fake electors.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She was the secretary for Trump's fake electors.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Even after Trump had lost all of his election cases, some of them were still pressuring their state lawmakers and the vice president Mike Pence to overturn the election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And on top of that, you had conversations going on about how they were going to use one of Trump's election lawsuits as cover for signing these documents.",Donald Trump,Arizona
They're also all related to this fake electors plot.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They've all been charged with the same nine counts.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, was indicted.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And Trump campaign aide Mike Roman has also been charged.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So first is Trump attorney Christina Bob.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"She is finally getting what's coming to her, it is long overdue.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"In June of last year, the Arizona Central News outlet reported that Christina Bob was exchanging text messages with Cyber Ninja CEO Doug Logan.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She texted back and forth with him 2000 times while his company was conducting that ridiculous audit in Maricopa County.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So as you all recall, Bob is an attorney.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She's a licensed attorney.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But during that period of time, when she was texting with him, she was a TV host for One American News Network.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And she wasn't communicating with him about stories.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"She wasn't just like, oh, getting feedback and reporting on the the election, so-called fraud it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he still, by the way, hasn't turned over all of them.",Donald Trump,Arizona
There are some that he's holding back because he claims they had nothing to do with the audit.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And she acted as a secret back channel to Donald Trump during all of this.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So Bob advised him, oh, don't tell anyone.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"She wrote, quote, This is a very nice, this is very nice and sincere.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Bob said, quote, had a detailed discussion with 45 today.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So the Arizona Republic News Outlet reached out to Bob and they asked her about all of this and she said, I never told him to lie.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Bob told the outlet, quote, I may have told him not to send the letter, but that's not lying.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And then Bob helped with coordination and communication between Logan and other people involved with Trump's campaign.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And the new indictment talks about Bob taking information from Rudy Giuliani that could be used to cast doubt about the election and feeding it to the Arizona Senate president.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So here she is, Bob is going on TV every day.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Bob's position as an advisor and conduit for funds allowed her access to Logan around the clock, including at the Coliseum where other reporters were restricted to the press booth and was a clear violation of that code.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So let's hope one of these people finally flips on him, and then they can indict Trump as well, because that would be another state case that can't, you know, be wiped away that even if Trump wins the presidency, he can't get rid of it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He can't shut it down.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He was a Trump stooge.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So there are some really dumb ideas that are being floated by the Republican Party and by President Trump right now.,Donald Trump,Arizona
But that's not what we've seen from President Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So again, he is an interesting voice here because he really highlights and represents the divide that exists within the Republican Party here in Arizona and beyond with moderate Republicans worried about the former president.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's now taking the extra step of campaigning for Vice President Harris, Juliet.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I also want to mention, Juliet, going back to the topic of immigration, we're hoping also to speak today to a DACA recipient to talk about what he wants to hear from Vice President Harris and Governor Walts when it comes to immigration, border security and immigration reform, because this is again a key issue for this state.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
It is good to be back in event marks Kamala Harris to Arizona in her second July.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She touched on a fe abortion a little bit on about uplifting Native Am That's something that Ste governor of the Gila Riv spoken support of and thr behind Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Number two, defeat Donald Trump, number three, fight for a better future, because we are fighting to protect our democracy, our freedoms, and our future.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And the only way forward, the only way forward is to elect Kamala Harris as our next president, and Tim Walz as our next vice president, and cast that vote now.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Hi, Kamala, thank you, okay, we have work to do.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And look, we all know who Donald Trump is.",Donald Trump,Arizona
This is not – because here's the thing we all know – he is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We can picture the Oval Office, right: and if he is elected on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the – hey guys, you know what: here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Clothes, food, toys, cell phones, a Trump sales tax, according to The Economist, would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And remember how we got here, donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And Donald Trump's not done.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And this is not the first time he has told us who he is.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He will ban abortion nationwide.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Only on a much greater scale than last time, and it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So first off, show of hands, who won this debate, was it Donald Trump: two for Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Was it Kamala Harris, was it neither: okay, Nicole, is a neither and Denise, you're a neither too.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's what I ask, okay, Jeff, what do you feel: you thought Kamala Harris won.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
A lot of people said she had to show us who she was.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"What she did, she came across as presidential, articulating her vision and her desire to help everybody get up on their feet.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump was just a spewing volcano of hate and bullying and it was just disqualifying.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"On Carlos, you thought Trump won.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, because I feel like he spoke more like the bigger issues, especially problems at the border.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He'd still be alive if we had a stronger border security.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Neither one showed that, okay, and Bonnie, you thought Kamala Harris won.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And even as far as Trump goes, I thought he was on the tame side for what's possible from Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Other than the comment about the immigrants eating the pets, I thought it was pretty controlled on his part.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, I just think she's the more more candidate that stands out the most.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I think this debate really from my side, I went more for her because she explained herself and said why she would be a good president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump was just spewing out hate.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And he wasn't really explaining why he would be a good president and what he would do to make himself look better.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, I did like how Kamala kind of opened the door to talk about how she feels about certain policies.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And I would like to just learn more, unfortunately, the way the debate turned out, we didn't get to hear a lot about exactly how she feels about certain things.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Well now Biden's out, so why can't he just go home: and Kamala, like other people have said, has opened a door and shown us more of some of herself.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And for vice president Harris, I think women's reproductive rights was her big issue and will be from now until election day.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Kamala Harris has been consistently supporting of women's right to make her own decisions.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And Harris doesn't really seem to jive with that logic.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump has gone back and forth many times over the issue.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Going back to the south where we see Donald Trump easily winning the deep red state of Alabama.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Arizona a Biden state will go for the GOP as Donald Trump wins back this state and gets 11 electoral votes.,Donald Trump,Arizona
We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat Violators Harris will be in California tonight She'll then head to Nevada on Sunday for a rally another critical swing state out west here Remember that vice presidential debate between governor Tim walls and senator JD Vance that's scheduled for this coming Tuesday night As we come up on the heels of October in the race for the White House in Douglas.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"As Trump makes his case today to Arizonans, his party remains deeply divided.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The frustration he feels is a reason why there is a robust Republicans for Harris movement.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Republicans voting for Harris explained their fears at a DNC convention watch party.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If it means being willing to concede a loss, he's a threat to democracy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Joining us now, the mayor of Tempe, Arizona, Corey Woods, who is a surrogate for Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's been an incredible public servant during the course of her career who always has put people first.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"As pretty much all the speakers have talked about, the first thing that Kamala Harris always led with when she was a prosecutor was Kamala Harris for the people.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
That's who she's been as Vice President.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And we know that that's why she's going to be elected the next president of the United States this coming November 5th.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Another finds Vice President Harris up by five.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
He's visiting the southern border.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So he actually back channeled it and called congressional Republicans to get it killed.,Donald Trump,Arizona
It's more about politics and doing whatever he thought would personally benefit him.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We need the leadership of Vice President Harris as president because, frankly, she has talked about how she becomes president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That same bill that was negotiated bipartisan basis, she will sign into law.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And we know Vice President Harris is someone who also cares about results and has a proven history of getting the job done.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Sir, I have less than a minute, but I want to ask, is Arizona a must win state for Vice President Harris: and I also want to ask how long you think the honeymoon phase will last past the DNC for the VP.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I think you're seeing Vice President Harris for who she really is, an exceptional candidate, an exceptional person.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump's gonna win Arizona probably by five points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We'll see what happens on election day, obviously but She's still gonna lose",Donald Trump,Arizona
She's also holding a rally outside Phoenix.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And really trying to excavate things about Harris when it comes to her economic plan, when it comes to social infrastructure that they believe can resonate with people.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And they've also built a huge coalition of Spanish speaking volunteers and supporters who are on the ground really trying to communicate why they believe Harris is the better choice.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Also today Kamala Harris plans to tackle an issue considered one of her biggest weaknesses, border security.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She said to visit the southern border in Arizona and make her case for handling the border crisis.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Well Harris is expected to propose sending more agents to the border and new ways to target fentanyl trafficking.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
The choices were Joe Biden and Donald Trump at that time.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"The pushing with Kamala with more current things like Chaperone and Charlie XCX when it comes to more pop culture stuff, I don't really agree with that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He wants you to buy the Word of God, Donald Trump edition.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"His name is going to be on there, embossed, right next to Luke.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Where these Bibles are made, so Mr. Tough Guy on China, except when he can make a few bucks, he's talking his Trump edition Bibles.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We are ready for a President, Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The point is, I was just picturing it, the point is if you elect Kamala, they will not be focused on their problems, they will be focused on yours.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They understand that too many folks, not just here in Arizona but across the country, are still struggling to pay the bills.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now, some people, because I'm having conversations around the country with folks as I go campaigning, and I'll hear some people say, you know, well, I remember the economy when those first two years with Trump, they were pretty good.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If you think prices are high now, Donald Trump's message is you ain't seen nothing yet.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Concrete plans she'll give first-time homebuyers up to $25,000 to help them with a down payment.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala already worked with Joe Biden to take on the drug companies, bring down the cost of insulin.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
You think Donald Trump's ever changed his diaper: no.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Vote, we do not need a President who's willing to make problems worse to make his politics better.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And that's why you've got to vote, and to help her do it, she needs a Senate full of public servants like Reuben Geigel.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now, I will tell you how he protected you, quote, unquote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he's out there saying, well, everyone wanted it this way.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if after you've gone through that and the folks who are unconvinced say, yeah, I don't know, I still like him, then I think you have to then say, yeah, but what about character, what about values: because that matters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's got a three-point lead, 51 to 48.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris, of course, will be here in Arizona later today, although the full details of her trip have still not been released.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For those of you who do not know, 18 of Donald Trump's co-conspirators were indicted in Arizona yesterday for election interference.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"18 of Donald Trump's co-conspirators were indicted on yesterday and surprisingly based on the documents that I'm seeing, Donald Trump wasn't one of those.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, there was some additional, some additional people who were indicted, but they were blacked out and I believe Donald Trump may be one of those people.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And C, that the following are two distinct lists, one of all the votes for President and the other of all the votes for Vice President, so cast as it were said, for President Donald J. Trump of the state of Florida, number of votes 11.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Merrick Garland never did and I wholeheartedly believe that if the January 6th committee hadn't conducted those hearings and presented the mountain of evidence that they had regarding January 6th, if they wouldn't have presented that information to the American people, Merrick Garland wouldn't have appointed Jack Smith and Jack Smith wouldn't have indicted Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"This is the first time the Vice President will visit Arizona since 2021 when she toured Lake Mead, now the face of shrinking water supply concerns for the Southwest.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris is in the battleground state of Arizona for the first time since President Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Her visit comes as she secures a major endorsement from the League of United Latin American Citizens, the first time the civil rights group has ever endorsed a candidate.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
It's his first campaign rally this week.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"During that press conference, Trump also committed to three presidential debates next month.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So far Harris has only confirmed she will be at one of them.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
He sent all of his allies up here to do so.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, Natalie, let's turn to the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Fixing the border is tough, so is Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But Elaine, you also mentioned that LULAC endorsement that Vice President Harris and Governor Walz received earlier today.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He wants to hear more from the Harris campaign on her vision for immigration reform and helping Dreamers like him.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
That she is going to actually prioritize and legalize Dreamers.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And obviously a lot of that depends on Congress as well, but it will really be interesting, Elaine, to see how Vice President Harris speaks about the topic of immigration, both immigration reform and border security before this Arizona crowd today.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Well, Jake, besides the Friday rally and a press conference Thursday, Trump has been somewhat absent from the campaign trail compared to his opponent.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So certainly it's a little bit of a downtime, but we did see Donald Trump do some interviews Friday into Monday remotely.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And he also sat down with livestreamer Aiden Ross.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, this is what it's all about, five days out from election day and Kamala Harris is here in Arizona trying to rally the troops for one last night, of course.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Nearly 63 million Americans have already voted and with the polls razor thin, Kamala Harris needs all the votes she can to become president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That is not who we are, kamala Harris appealed to voters' concerns about the economy, the cost of living and jobs, saying it will be her focus every single day as president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She also promoted access to health care, saying it fitted her belief and dignity for all people.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala Harris says she's fighting for the future, describing it as a fight for freedom.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Kamala Harris has a chance.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He insults Latinos, scapegoats, immigrants, and it's not just what he says, it's what he will do.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It's going to be fantastic, i can't wait to celebrate Kamala's win because American people are smart, they're giving, they love others and I think that's what the Harris campaign is all about.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And I think that Vice President Harris is obviously best equipped to do that.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Everything he says out of his mouth is just negative.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Almost 10 years into the party's Trump era, more and more Arizona Republicans are coming forward to say the same thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Joining us are two members of Arizona Republicans for Harris, retired appeals court judge Daniel Barker and business owner Emily Benton Heaton.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I want to make one thing clear at the start because there's a few Republicans for Harris groups.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Our goal is like the Harris campaign, we want to see Harris elected, but we're prohibited from coordinating with the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He's the co-chair of Republicans for Harris through the campaign.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Just describe that campaign, this is something we've really worked hard for.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Monday morning, you're going to see 50 digital billboards throughout the valley on all the freeways saying Arizona Republicans for Harris, Arizona Independents for Harris, Arizona Moderates for Harris, Arizona Conservatives for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Make the case for Republicans who might be thinking about voting for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala Harris, I believe, fits all of those.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now, of course, we're Arizona Republicans for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But what I appreciate about her is that I know she is, she has a great track record of following the rule of law and the Constitution and continuing our democracy.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Party's been captured by Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So is that really the breaking point for you, do you see a day after Trump, after Trump leaves the scene, when you might come back to the Republican Party if it's refashioned: i'm not sure, actually, at this point.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Worst news, especially if your name is Donald J. Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yes, Trump is especially screwed by this decision.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It's almost mind boggling that the Arizona Supreme Court ruled when it did because this decision came less than a day after Trump released a video message trying to present himself as somewhat of a moderate on abortion.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She is the best candidate.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now, Harris chose Tim Walz for VP.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He has a progressive record as the Governor of Minnesota.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You say that you want politics to return to the middle, but is her vice presidential pick pulling her away from the middle: i don't think so.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He did some practical things while he was governor addressing some of the social service needs of his state, but I wouldn't, I think the Trump campaign's attempts to paint him as overly progressive just don't ring true.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump was not a good president from the perspective of a mayor and he was, did not interact well with cities.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"She's since kind of walked back those comments, but she hasn't really sat for any major interviews.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She takes a couple of questions from the press every now and then.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's already said that if she's successful, she will endorse that plan and work to see it implemented.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So she does, has announced a good policy when it comes to border security issues and immigration reform.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Donald Trump has been critical of that plan, but has offered nothing as an alternative.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, well, Trump has done a better job of messaging and his message is nothing but criticism of the current administration without offering up an alternative plan.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The alternative plan that was presented was the bipartisan plan that was negotiated by Republican and Democratic senators and met with both parties approval until Mr. Trump decided that he didn't want to have a solution at the border because he didn't want the Biden administration to have any credit for that.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And it's very much a wedge issue, an emotional issue that can be used for his personal political gain during the campaign.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"No, seriously, she thinks we're dumb.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He wants to terminate the Constitution of the United States.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala said she won't take your guns.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But Kamala also alleges she will protect your free speech rights, which is not only laughable, given the Biden-Harris administration actively worked and is still working to curtail those rights.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But also given how her running mate, Tim Wols, feels about the absoluteness of free speech.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And for her to say the craziest, most outlandish things like Donald Trump is going to get rid of the Constitution.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, why did he get rid of the Constitution when he was the president: because it doesn't exist.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And it's sad because Shannon Sharpe had her on his podcast, but I don't think he would have Donald Trump on his podcast.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I honestly believe if Donald Trump won on his podcast, he'll show it out.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And people will be able to see Donald Trump is not a Nazi.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump is not this crazy old man is going to somehow unravel the foundation of this country.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I would certainly hope so, it's so funny because Kamala was caught on a hot mic.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But when she was with Big Gretsch and they were talking about how they're losing with men, they conveniently didn't notice that there were microphones all around.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump is so radical.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So I think people are waking up more so than what it has to do with Kamala Harris independently.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, she comes across very disingenuous.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's not a genuine person.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And it's very questionable what her ethnicity really is.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
We don't know how black she really supposed to be.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So she whipped that one out, we would actually believe it.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But speaking of AOC, you know, there's still the hysteria over Trump selling out Madison Square Garden.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"These are many stop the steal rallies, these are rallies to prime an electorate into rejecting the results of an election if it doesn't go the way that they want because Donald Trump and that entire cadre of people up on that stage, Stephen Miller, et cetera, do not respect the law.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's a dictator.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's going to ruin America.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's Hitler.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"All of these things, the American people are going to be able to see for themselves that they're not true, that he cares about the American people.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's going to make this a big deal.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's going to make the economy better.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so if they want to go this route, Trump's a fascist this.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And I think that they're they're actually doing what they're claiming Donald Trump and his supporters are doing.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's not that serious, donald Trump left office.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He left, they finished the vote the same day.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The man relinquished his position as the president and Biden is the president.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They want to jump out of windows at the campus because of Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But then on the flip side of that, when you see a Trump rally, you look at Madison Square Garden.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But by all accounts, everybody that was there, everybody that's gone to a Trump rally, people are kind.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, you just don't see this kind of stuff at a Trump rally.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, I honestly think Donald Trump dominated, but he still end up not getting the electoral college votes from the state of Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But I would hope that people would say I'm voting for Donald Trump, so I'm going to vote for Carrie Lake and I'm going to vote for the Republicans down ticket.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I really hope that the people will wake up because if you look at the polling, the polling match how I feel and how others are feeling because Donald Trump is dominating.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But she's trying to be Donald Trump 2.0.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Nobody can do what Trump does.,Donald Trump,Arizona
But how do you think this is looking a week out: i personally think he's looking great for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I think that Donald Trump is going to win this thing by a lot.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I think they're doing horrible.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They got to pay ten million dollars allegedly to Beyonce for her to do a three minute speech.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump just sold out Madison Square Garden.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump's momentum is out of control.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And the more that Kamala goes on television and she just word salad her way through it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She don't answer questions.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She can't tell you what she's going to do.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She telling she is a new way forward.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
But I think Donald Trump is going to kick butt this time.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Elon Musk have endorsed Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump went on Joe Rogan.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And it's the podcast probably 50 million views right now.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I mean Donald Trump has gone all these other podcasts that are more cultural and not just political podcast.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I mean he got shot.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Joe Rogan thing too because it came out today the podcast put out that Kamala said she would do the Joe Rogan podcast.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
But on her terms they want them to come to her and it can only be an hour.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump did the podcast humanized him to millions of people that have never even thought about listening to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And then you got Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I want to see what she has to say.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
But she won't Joe Rogan to somehow fly somewhere instead of a podcast where Joe Rogan has never done that for any day.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And then Donald Trump did three hours and he could have did six hours.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Y'all know how he talked, i mean I watched the whole thing and I was like God dang this is pretty interesting.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I thought she was like confident.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I thought she was confident enough to run the country.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's not even confident enough to do a podcast.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And Kamala Harris hasn't done a good job at that.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's cackling and laughing and can't answer questions.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's seeing a timid.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's not confident, she's looking down every time she interviews.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And I think it's going to hurt her more than what the polls are showing.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"My mama, and she don't represent mama vibes.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She don't represent grandma vibes.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"This woman is illegitimate, and I think this time there's a lot of other women which I'm glad they didn't use them.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That would have been far better leaders, it would have been far more confident against Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And be very confident, kamala Harris has none of these qualities.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"None at all, and I think it's going to hurt her.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Can you just imagine her representing our country: she's trying to eke out right now.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Like it's just she's so uncomfortable.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Like, what is the world going to look like if this woman is our president: not because she's a woman, but because she's Kamala.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala Harris and her minions are saying, you're wrong not to pick her a woman because she's black.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Wait a minute, she married a white man.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So she don't even support black men.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She married a white man.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And then out of all the running mates, she could have picked.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She picked a corny white man.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She didn't pick a black man.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She didn't pick a black woman.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She didn't marry a black man.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She married a white man and picked a white running mate.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I think she'll get more of the black vote if she did say, I'm gonna pick a woman to be a vice president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Tommy, why not, why can't it be two women on a ticket, why can't she pick another woman: if it's women power strong, I think she'd get more credence if she picked a woman because then you'd be like, I ain't women.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So I don't know if I look at Tim Wols, I'm like, yeah, she picked a white man from the Midwest.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Joe had to pick Kamala because he had to pick a black woman.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
But I think that Donald Trump is gonna win this thing pretty big.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I want to go back there, i want to go into Thanksgiving and be like, God, we got Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We elected Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Appreciate you as always, all right, folks, Donald Trump and the increasingly haunting realization that he will be reelected has broken the collective liberal brain and I just hope that their networks cover therapy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The lib media fixtures have abandoned trying to polish the turd that is Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So instead they decided to go full bore TDS.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They were just desperate to characterize Trump's Madison Square Garden rally as a gathering of Nazis.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"TDS, Trump derangement syndrome, isn't a disorder based on reality, but rather on delusion.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think a lot of people are seeing that rally at Madison Square Garden, seeing all those people doesn't mean he's going to win the race.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, a different country, a different time, what we heard at that rally should be enough to shake folks awake because he's talking about you.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"All of you, he's talking about you.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's not going to be, he's not going to, you know, say, oh, you're with a white guy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"No, he's going to deport you and put the white guy with someone else.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The man is out there, i sincerely hope their employers cover therapy on their health plans because they need it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I've personally been physically assaulted for my outspoken support of Donald Trump, but I fear this go around will be worse.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If you're a Trump supporter, be proud of it, but keep your head on a swivel because this is no joke.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So we traveled to Tempe, Arizona, just outside of Phoenix, to sit down with four lifelong Republicans to get their take on the presidential race, how they view Trump and the future of their party.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"How many of you have voted for Donald Trump, how many of you voted for Donald Trump twice, and how many of you plan on supporting Donald Trump this November: none of you.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He deliberately lies, and then he lies about his lies.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He never voted for Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, 2016, during that campaign, he mocked a disabled person.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I look at his economic policy, and he's basically talking about a huge national sales tax without any kind of approval from Congress.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And basically, at his whim, and he's looking at anywhere from 20 percent up to 60 percent of tariffs.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It's not even like he's talking like a Republican.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's talking command and control economy at this point.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's not even giving us a choice.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think by and large, Kamala Harris is a decent person.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I think she's going to protect the rule of law, follow our constitutional process.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If she loses the election, she's not going to claim it was rigged.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That means reconciling their personal faith with some of Harris's positions, like on abortion.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But for Amanda, abortion is one of the issues where she aligns with Harris most.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris would enforce the law.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Clothes, food, toys, cell phones, a Trump sales tax, according to the Economist, would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And remember how we got here, donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade and they did as he intended.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"This is not because here's the thing, we all know, he is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We can picture the Oval Office, right: and if he is elected, on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the, hey guys, you know what, here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And Donald Trump is not done.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"This is not, because here's the thing we all know, he is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"A Trump sales tax according to the economist would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the... Hey, guys, you know what: here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And remember how we got here, donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade and they did as he intended.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We are here together and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life and your busy schedules.,Donald Trump,Arizona
We love our country.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And with that spirit and with this spirit, we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, the love that we have for our country, is to then fight for its ideals.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We can picture the Oval Office, right: and if he is elected, on day one Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We are done with him.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We are here together, and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life and your busy schedules.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yes, and with that spirit, and with this spirit, we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, the love that we have for our country, is to then fight for its ideals.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the, hey guys, you know what: here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Which is why, yes, we will vote because we also understand if he was elected, he was elected.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the, hey guys you know what, here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Family on a much greater scale than last time, and it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We are done with that, so five days out and it all comes down to this.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And with that spirit and with this spirit, we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, the love that we have for our country is to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We are done with the nation.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He did a rally yesterday.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's doing a town hall style rally right now.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He worked at McDonald's as well.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump would like to have those.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We got the Trump iconic mug, my favorite.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But the lower propensity voters, which Trump needs to turn out to win, they are unprecedentedly Republican and the advantage is sizable.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Like Insider Advantage has Trump up by one.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trafalgar only shows Trump up by two, but you look at CBS News, they have Trump up three.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Now it's also true that there is a segment of the Republican electorate in the state of Arizona that is like the old guard McCain Republican that doesn't like Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And probably doesn't vote for Donald Trump and probably never voted for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now Republicans lead by registered party by like 10%, they're the ones that are turning out, but also these newer voters who have never voted before that are joining Donald Trump and his movement.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The question is, is there enough of them and are the lower propensity Democrat voters turning out: and if they do, which way are they going to vote is another question because the lower propensity voter, regardless of party registration, has been moving towards Donald Trump over the past four years.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And it's true, when you look at the Hispanic vote, for example, if Republicans do get like a five point improvement, which they can Arizona, it's already Trump's.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if Trump is able to improve among white working class voters by a few points, when again, that's a demographic Biden did well with.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump already out of the gate with a slight improvement wins, that doesn't even mention, oh, he could really change the game if he gets like 42 percent of Hispanic voters and does a little bit better with these working class like Filipino voters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump is.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump and many of his MAGA fans are having trouble with their own fake audits that they've demanded while they're ramping up attacks on democracy.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump speaking to a crowd with all of the usual pageantry.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"This was this weekend and this is part of what this MAGA movement has become, calls to decertify elections even when their own sham audits, which aren't valid and wouldn't change the outcome anyway, actually found that Trump lost by even more than he thought.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Republican Congresswoman Cheney, who of course was ousted from leadership over confronting Trump's big lie, is saying pay attention because this person who may run again for president is dangerous.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It seemed like a major development from the White House lectern, spurning executive privilege claims by Donald Trump if he tries to make them around January 6th.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, you know, Republicans first predicted that Donald Trump would win, then that the Supreme Court was going to intervene on his behalf, then that Biden would last 10 days.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"They spent thousands and thousands of dollars and it turned out at the end of it, even after they hired like a biased Republican leaning conspiracy firm to do the recount, that Biden got more votes under the recount than Trump did, more than the initial count.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"One of them said that he was on the fence until he said when Kamala did not go on the Joe Rogan podcast, that was what influenced his vote.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He ended up voting for Trump, but he said that he was open to listening to Kamala on the podcast and when she didn't, again, not necessarily all the issues, but the fact that he said she didn't seem like a real person because she couldn't talk for an extended period of time.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Kamala is going to fight for our freedoms and not only just for our freedoms but for education.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump has been a part of this project for a long time, and I hope you will enjoy it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Number two, defeat Donald Trump, number three, fight for a better future, because we are fighting to protect our democracy, our freedoms and our future.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And the only way forward, the only way forward is to elect Kamala Harris as our next president and Kim was as our next vice president and cast that vote now.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the, Hey guys, you know what: here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Clothes, food, toys, cell phones, a Trump sales tax, according to the economist would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the affordable care act, also known as Obamacare.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Only one man can fix that, that is Donald J. Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"On behalf of the 16,000 men and women represented by the National Board of Patrol Council, we strongly support and endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And we're going to have, and despite all of the damage that Kamala has inflicted on the state and, you know, don't forget, she's the vice president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But Joe gave her the assignment.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I'm not even sure what what is he doing: although, although he's looked very good lately, he's looked because he's he's looked better than her, actually.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now, I've always said I'm not a big fan of his, as you probably have heard, but he's superior to her.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He's more intelligent than she is.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Can you believe you ever think you'd be hearing that: i mean, but she said last week that she can't think of one thing that she would do differently.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Not one thing she think of it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
The people of this impoverished and often overlooked region could be the key to Kamala Harris' hopes of winning the presidency.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So we voted for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"His candidacy could drive turnout, boosting Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris has targeted Native voters with ads like this one and has 20 paid staffers organizing on tribal lands.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Last week, her running mate Tim Waltz held a rally on the Navajo Nation.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump is not popular here.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"The stuff he does, I don't understand, you know, a riot on the Capitol.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It is close, there is no doubt about that, but it is probably the one state out of the seven that is pretty much assured of falling to Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So Arizona is a Trump state, and I think that needs to be pointed out there.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She encouraged early voting and said women should get Trump's vote.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She's also a member of the Democratic Party today campaigning for Harris and her husband Tim Walls.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She held a one week out early vote event highlighting their campaigns push for reproductive rights.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Absolutely, but make no mistake, if Trump imposes his 50 state abortion ban, those protections disappear.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I mean Trump is all doom and gloom.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's telling us that the country, we've lost the American dream.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Now he's on about Puerto Rico and being a garbage can.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So he is doom and gloom all the time, like everything's bad.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I voted for him the previous time he ran.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Just I think he's a businessman.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's not a politician and I think he knows what the country needs to get it back on track.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She's taken personal offence over Donald Trump's criticism of some migrant groups and she concedes she could head back to New Zealand if he wins.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump is currently on track to win.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But besides the two morning console polls, which again heavily lean towards the left, every other poll has shown Trump ahead, with one of them showing a tie.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so currently, the state of Arizona is going to be tilled red based on the most recent poll, but Trump is performing a lot better than he was in 2020 when he lost the state entirely to Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We have seen the growth of hate groups, particularly over the last 20 years, and even more so, at a much greater rate, since Trump became president.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"These hate groups, particularly, I guess Hispanics, which is what Trump and his gang are really pushing hard on.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It was the party of John McCain and then Donald Trump and MAGA continue to attack John McCain, even after John McCain passed away.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump has challenged John McCain's heroism, continues to make fun of the late great Senator John McCain.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And you've got Donald Trump out there attacking John McCain and saying things like this, play the clip.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And then more recently, Donald Trump, I think mocking John McCain for not voting to kill Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act here, play this clip.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's why they hate Donald Trump so much.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"This is Michael Popak for Legal AF, an Arizona criminal court judge has told MAGA lawyer Rudy Giuliani to give it a rest and give it up and stop raising nonsensical motions that don't have one scintilla of evidence and support in the criminal prosecution by the Arizona attorney general against Rudy Giuliani and others, almost Donald Trump, who were involved with the attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of power.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"What has changed: it's a three-point difference between the Democrat and Donald Trump, but stuff has changed.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It's kind of pushed those folks over to Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris now has a five-point lead with that group.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It could basically just maintain, rFK Jr. at that rally endorsing Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The thing is that it's really going to matter everyone's vote because, remember, Biden only beat Trump in Arizona by just 11,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But Kamala Harris had a bump going into her convention.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And so Harris had kind of had this momentum leading into this kind of this honeymoon phase irregardless.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But I think the rubber is going to hit the road and the race is going to look a lot more realistic, I think, come mid September right in there once this race kind of settles down and these campaigns hunker in, because that's the only thing the polling showed is that, you know, with on the issues, Trump is doing better on some of the key issues that Arizona voters care most about, such as pocketbook issues and immigration.",Donald Trump,Arizona
They also have a lot more money left over than Trump and his side.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Meanwhile, Vice President Harris, she talks about the border security plans and passing that Senate bill.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But she says that the border was secure for four years.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So she's going to have to convince the American people that she is going to be tougher on the border when millions poured across it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"We won't win, he won't win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And it comes as recent polling from Bloomberg and Morning Consult shows Harris gaining ground in Arizona and Nevada.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, obviously she's trying to kind of capitalize on the border issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
This is something that Donald Trump has very much made kind of the cornerstone of his campaigns since he's been running for president.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Does the Harris walls ticket benefit from that crossover vote: most likely.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Today, she spoke for about 25 minutes, focusing her comments heavily on abortion rights, claiming that Donald Trump will enact a nationwide abortion ban.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We have an opportunity to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And before Harris took the stage, her supporters heard speeches from Tucson Mayor Regina Romero, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, Governor Katie Hobbs, Senator Mark Kelly and his wife Gabby Giffords.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Sean Rice, 12 News, sean, thank you for the wrap up there, and it is a busy day here in our state because now it's former President Donald Trump's turn set to make his final live pitch to Arizona voters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Bianca, yeah, guys, good afternoon, we do expect this to be former President Donald Trump's last campaign visit to Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But this marks his third visit to Arizona in October alone.,Donald Trump,Arizona
You may remember earlier this month he was in Prescott Valley rallying supporters there.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And just last week he was here in Arizona speaking at ASU in Tempe.,Donald Trump,Arizona
We weren't sure if we were going to see the typical lines outside of this venue like we typically do at Trump events.,Donald Trump,Arizona
We're told the event is start to begin around six o'clock tonight with Trump taking the stage after 7 30 for an hour live from Desert Diamond Arena.,Donald Trump,Arizona
In 2016 the state of Arizona was won by Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by 3.5% of the vote.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Let's say Trump only wins, or Arizona excuse me, only votes 2% to the right of the popular vote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Well Trump would then win the state by 0.2% if the numbers remained the same.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So what I'm saying is for a state like Arizona if the popular vote is only 1.8% lead for Harris while the popular vote does not elect the president it may be a sign that Harris is not faring too well in a lot of the battleground states which are expected to vote more Republican or more Democrat depending than the popular vote it depends on the state.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Some key counties I'm watching in the state of Arizona it all begins and ends with Maricopa County this is a county that was reliable Republican in 2012 and even before that in 2016 Trump won it by 2.8% he won statewide by a little under 4% of the vote in 2020 Joe Biden wins this county by 2.2% and Biden wins this state by just 0.3% of the vote.,Donald Trump,Arizona
If Trump is going to win the state of Arizona he either needs to do way better everywhere else like drastically better and keep Maricopa County at 2.2 or Trump needs to get this number at 2.2% slightly smaller than what it is.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So Trump's number one target has to be Maricopa County in Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Harris's number one target has to be defending Maricopa County and trying to grow on what Biden was able to do in 2020.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Another county I'm watching is Yuma County not as big population as Maricopa it was 12.6 in 2012 for Romney 1.1 for Trump in 2016 6.2 for Trump in 2020 I'm interested in the margins here because for Trump if Trump is not able to improve in Maricopa he needs to do better in a county like Yuma where he did go up five points from 16 to 20 up to 6.2 but if Trump is not doing better in Maricopa this 6.2 needs to become like plus 10 or plus 9 to make up enough votes to try and counterbalance Maricopa so Yuma is what I'm watching for for the margins I know it'll go for Trump I'm watching for the margins on that one.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Navajo County the final county I'm looking at 7.9 for Romney in 2012 10.2 for Trump in 2016 8.3 for Trump in 2020 again another smaller county we fully expect to go for Donald Trump but what is the percentage margin of victory in that county where again if Maricopa is staying the same or only budging a bit you have to look at a county like this and say okay can Trump make up the votes in a county like Navajo and by how much this is one I'm very much closely watching.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That was the same Mark Fincham, who was at the Capitol on January the 6th, speaking this weekend at Donald Trump's big lie-filled Arizona rally.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yes, he is running for Arizona Secretary of State, where he would be in charge of the state's elections.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And yes, he has the full and complete endorsement of Donald J. Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Elaine Godfrey was at Trump's rally this weekend, reporting on it for the Atlantic, where she described the event as the soft launch of Trump's second campaign and Tess Owen is a senior reporter at Vice News, where she's been covering right-wing extremism.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I talked to so many people there and every person that I spoke with said that they did not think Joe Biden was the rightful president, that Trump actually won and the Democrats had stolen the election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"How big and widespread is this group, how surprising is it to see a Trump endorsed Oath Keeper candidate for elected office: thanks for having me, Nivi.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But I think one key thing is, as Elaine points down her dispatch from the Arizona rally, you know, the way to achieve legitimacy in the GOP these days is to rally behind Trump's election lies.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Elaine, I want to play you a clip of Trump endorsed Arizona governor candidate Carrie Lake from that rally.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"These groups have responded favorably to her focus on health care, education, and social justice, a contrast to Trump's policy emphasis on economic growth and immigration control.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Men, on the other hand, remain one of Trump's most reliable voting blocks in both Arizona and Nevada.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"His messaging on economic strength, law and order, and conservative values resonates with male voters who view him as a champion of traditional American ideals.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Both Arizona and Nevada have been closely watched swing states in recent elections.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris's campaign, on the other hand, has concentrated on appealing to women, young voters, and Latino communities through a platform centered on healthcare access, education, and social equity.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Also, Donald Trump just seems very unwell.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He was making noises throughout the night, just making weird noises while instead of even speaking here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, seriously, folks, this is what Donald Trump's doing right now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"How unhinged, how demented he continues talking about Adam Schiff.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He goes shifty, shift, shifty, shift.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Then he starts talking about Hillary Clinton and IQ.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Then Donald Trump talks about a certain pastor who says that he's great.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I didn't know what he's talking about.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And he was a big supporter and now I have unbelievable evangelical and Christian support because I have.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, I've done a great job for them and we're, you know, we're together, but he said he may not know the Bible quite as well as other people are supposed to, but I mean, look at this guy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She's a cracker and the more pressure Kamala the more pressure Kamala has the more you see it happening.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
What what then Donald Trump hears an airplane believes it's an F-35 and then says look at me.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Watch this, did you see his right leg there: you see again, those are signs and symptoms of mini strokes.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We need to move past that and that's why she's strongly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris and also LeBron James endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris today as well.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
We really need to see what's there needs to be ramifications for what Donald Trump said at the beginning because I believe that was a felony threat right there.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So for the course of this exercise we're going to go ahead and give Arizona to Trump which puts him at 230.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Alright if that's the case Trump's at 252.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Harris aides quietly grow more bullish on defeating Trump.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Nonetheless okay and look I mean Trump's not going to the door 246 still this blue wall was still up there right so if she holds on in Wisconsin which historically is a really close state by the way we're going to show that on election night and if she holds on to Michigan and holds on to Pennsylvania and then picks up that electoral vote in in Omaha she can win despite the strength of Trump in Nevada Arizona North Carolina and even Georgia I mean that would be something a week from tonight Karl.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I think she made a big mistake by engaging on the issue of John Kelly's comments about Donald Trump being a fascist.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She basically spent two days talking about that and that's not a winning issue for her.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She made a mistake if the campaign really does believe that they've made a big step forward by emphasizing the fascist comment.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So first off, let's talk about Arizona, how is Arizona trending so far: you've got to give it to Donald Trump right now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Now we have been reporting tonight on new ballots coming in for Maricopa County that are giving us a lot of new insight into the potential matchup here between President Trump and Vice President Biden.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That is where Phoenix is, tonight we have already received 70,000-ish ballots out of Maricopa County, which didn't change the lead in Arizona, but changed potentially expectations in terms of who's going to end up on top in that state between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We see those very aggressive Trump supporters gathering outside the Maricopa County Elections Board, making a lot of noise and making it hard for poll workers to end their shifts and get to their cars.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"One who's voting for the very first time, another who believes Harris needs to lay out who she is as a candidate and some of her policies more clearly.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Equal pay and, exactly, do you think and feel she needs to clarify more on what matters: i think she needs to clarify her policy on immigration more and her policy on health care more because I don't think she's really laid that out correctly.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yes, as she said, former President Trump in Arizona today delivering remarks at a campaign event in Tucson.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But here's the kicker, harris is support.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"One, her stance on economic recovery seems to be hitting home with middle class families, especially with all the ups and downs we've been having lately.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Plus her focus on health care, making it more affordable.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And Harris talking about voting rights.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Like when we're talking about immigration reform, climate change, making health care affordable, Harris, she's got plans and people seem to be responding.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And this little battle they've got going on, it's pushing some Republicans, more moderate ones, you know, the kind who'd usually vote red no matter what they're looking at Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Maybe they don't agree with her on everything, but she seems less extreme.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I asked him ultimately come Tuesday night if he does lose to this Trump back challenger.,Donald Trump,Arizona
We have been talking for weeks about what Republican voters took away and what they thought of the damning evidence and the allegations laid out by those closest to Donald Trump through these public hearings from the January 6th select committee.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Used investigators from the Arizona attorney general's office to go sniff around and do the best to build up a report showing that Donald Trump actually won.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He was not able to do so, and look where he is at.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I think that's also why Kelly Ward, who's the current chairwoman of the Arizona Republican party, I think she said it best last week at the rally as she introduced Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"She is the backing of Donald Trump, the backing of Paul Gosar, the backing of Mike Lindell.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump lost the state by just about 10,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if Carrie Lake is able to get those folks out in the rural part of state, who hadn't voted before until Donald Trump came along, but also win over so many folks like herself, who one time consider themselves moderates or even liberals or moderate Republicans to come over and embrace her here in the Maricopa County suburb areas, you're looking at a Governor Carrie Lake in 2023.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And the challenge, though, is that it's really hard to have a plan when, as President Biden has said, with 50 senators, with 50 Democratic senators, every single one of them is a president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And just quickly, just speaking of Arizona, Amy, and speaking of election, former President Trump was in Arizona over the weekend talking to his fans, thousands of them repeating the same mistruths about the election, saying he won.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Christians will not be safe with Kamala Harris as president of the United States.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Hello everybody and welcome to my channel CanvaSync for Kamala Harris on the streets of Arizona, if you like the channel please subscribe and press the bell icon so you get updates and I do intend to bring some more videos to you.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And we were basically asking for their support for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's a registered independent and has previously voted for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She moved to Arizona from Pennsylvania where her entire family they are Trump voters.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She categorically as categorically as you can said that she was not going to vote for Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And she will definitely be voting for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
They said that they would vote for Kamala Harris for sure.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And they said, we're just not going to vote for, you know, President Biden and Donald Trump because they were too old.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And they just could not relate to them.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So we knocked at the door and there was no one home.,Donald Trump,Arizona
We were about to head out when the neighbor saw us and he came to check what was going on because he was watching his neighbor's house that we were knocking the door on.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So he told us that the homeowners were out of town for a week and asked us what we wanted.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So we shared with him.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Then he also shared with us that this time it's going to be different.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He said he was not going to vote for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He would vote for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And definitely voting Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
We'll be doing this again next week.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, the Trump campaign was the exactly that's okay.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But the Trump campaign was indeed the first ones to announce that they were planning on, you know, announcing this lawsuit alleging voter fraud.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And the other one says I was working as a ballot observer for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Is the Trump campaign considering legal action in Arizona: well, to be clear in Arizona as well, the Trump campaign has already been granted a motion to intervene in a state case over this Sharpie Gate conspiracy theory, as has the local Democratic Party here in the state of Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, again, they are not exactly alleging that they completely agree with all of these concerns.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So that's a big challenge For Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She needs to win all the core democratic voter groups in addition to 10 to 15 percent of Republicans in Arizona in order to take the state that's because of Republicans general turnout advantage in general elections Bram I know another big debate that we will all be watching is coming up this Wednesday evening It's the US Senate debate between Reuben, Gallego and Kerry Lake.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They say it doesn't matter who runs against the president, that they think that former President Trump has this on lock.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I well, I still feel like Trump's going to do better.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Just based off recent events, his polls are skyrocketing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And I think he's just already secured the presidency.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He has put out his support today for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
He has endorsed her.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So we're going to get behind you.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"There's a new campaign, there's a new person, presumably at the top of the ticket, assuming Kamala Harris is able to do as she said, earn and win the Democratic nomination.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And that's what Democrats have sorely needed, the public opinion polls that we've seen, particularly the CBS polls where you've seen President Biden up until this point trailing Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But former President Donald Trump making an interesting move holding a massive rally here at Madison Square Garden over the weekend.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris is heavily favored to win New York, the Empire State.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
It's one different thing It's very interesting to watch and if you're watching Donald Trump Donald Trump doesn't know what to do He's got no idea what to do.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's flailing all over the place He can't figure anything city today He said he has he had more people than MLK for the big speech.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, good afternoon, Connell, to all your viewers, so when President Trump visited Cochise County about three weeks ago, I think now maybe a month ago, we had two days before his arrival, we had an individual go onto social media and made threats to harm President Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"What would you say about your own experience working back and forth and especially the communication with the Secret Service on that day: well, several weeks before, kind of before President Trump came in, we had Senator Vance come here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We've been looking for him, the guy that made the threat against President Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It engages my community to find him and see him and call 911, but also lets him know that we're not messing with them.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris supports the creation of a national law protecting abortion rights.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She says she would veto a federal abortion ban.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"How dare they: donald Trump has said that abortion access should be left up to the states, but he's been inconsistent about whether he would oppose a federal abortion ban.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It just isn't a Donald Trump state.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But with this cooperation agreement, Ellis signed Monday.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And the only way forward, the only way forward is to elect Kamala Harris as our next president, and Tim Ross as our next vice president, and cast that vote now.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He will ban abortion nationwide He will restrict access to birth control put IVF treatments at risk and force States to monitor women's pregnancies, and you don't have to take my word for it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It's what he will do if Elected you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies Only on a much greater scale than last time and it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump So five days out and it all comes down to this we are here together And you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life and your busy schedules You have taken the time to be here because I know we all love our country We love our country And when you love something you fight for it you fight for it And with that spirit and with this spirit we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism The love that we have for our country is to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize The promise of America.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"For Kamala Harris, well this is almost like a backup plan state.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If she can't win those three critical states on the east coast if you like, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, she would need the 11 electoral college votes here in Arizona to get across the line.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump leads by 2 points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Subscribe if you support Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Like if you support Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I'm not sure any American President has ever uttered those words other than Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so when he ran for president the first time, he said he would support punishing women who got an abortion, punishing women.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I will tell you how he protected you, quote unquote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And Harris supporters here we talked to say they know Arizona is really an important state.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It should note, we did not find a single person who audibly would tell us that they voted for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He keeps saying it and I've been thinking about it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"For those of you who haven't been paying attention, you know, at Trump's rallies, he has been making it a point to tell everyone, get out and vote early, get out and vote early.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But as you can see here and I will zoom in, it clearly shows Donald Trump's ground game is impeccable, but it was the absentee ballots that brought Joe Biden over to finish line.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Where this section of border wall built during the Trump years abruptly ends, he lost before it could be completed, cartels who often abuse and exploit migrants then leave them here at the doorstep of America.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's just been going on for too long, well, I think what some people forget is there was a bipartisan bill that was ready to be voted on, and Trump sort of killed it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Aren't for everyone, kamala says things that we don't like.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump says things that we don't like.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so Harris, as I said, had an 18-point advantage with Latinos.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris winning women by 16 points.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And that's a potential pool and pot of voters for Kamala Harris to be talking to.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You see, Harris has a lead on that category, an upper single-digit lead.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's voting for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She thinks he will win this time because of inflation and because of the immigration issue.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And listen, he thinks Kamala Harris is a smarter candidate, a more empathetic candidate, and he thinks she will eke it out.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They're not closet Trump supporters anymore, and it's not taboo to be a Trump supporter.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala has it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She has it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's honest.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's not a felon, you know, once again.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"What they tell us, and they've told us on the past trips, is that that is largely economics, that people just feel bruised, people have nostalgic memories of the pre-COVID Trump economy, interest rates were lower, there were more jobs, grocery prices were lower.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Now it's Vice President Harris trying to fight through people here.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They remember how hard COVID hit them, and they remember before that when Trump was president, things here were booming.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And some of them want to go back, and they think that's the way to do it, even though they are repulsed by Trump's toxic comments about immigrants and about Latinos.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But there is a significant amount of support and energy for Donald Trump that I wasn't necessarily expecting.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's the issue for the Trump campaign right now.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Who supports Trump and Gallego at the same time.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And quite honestly I think what happened is the McCain Republicans in Arizona hate Donald Trump so much that they sat on the sidelines.,Donald Trump,Arizona
What we hear from voters is basically there's only one Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"She is trying too hard to be like him, attach herself to him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Harris also promised to be a president for all Americans.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Fox News' Nicole Christine was at that event today, and she was hearing from Harris supporters.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Less than a week out from election day, supporters of the Harris Walls ticket say they're showing up to fight for the next generation.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It was an afternoon filled with music from Los Tigres del Norte, and a proud vocal against the second presidency for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, Kamala Harris is in Phoenix, Arizona today, her fourth visit to the state this year, without making a single trip to the southern border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I was reading a report by another border chief who was saying the name Kamala Harris actually elicits eye rolls out of border patrol agents and border law enforcement, because everything has just gotten worse since she became the quote, Borders Are.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They want to be here, and then quite candidly, Donald Trump, he's driving people to the middle, people like myself that have been longtime Republicans, appointed a judge by two Republican governors, different, you know, the Superior Court and the Court of Appeals, that his positions on this election denial, where it has foundational drive people to the center.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Your group, the Arizona Republicans who believe in treating others with respect, who are now leaning towards many of them, Kamala Harris, put up about 50 digital billboards in the Phoenix metropolitan area, along the freeways within the last month.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They'll say Arizona Independence for Harris, others Arizona Moderates for Harris, Arizona Conservatives for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And it is pointing to momentum on the electoral college side heading toward Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"It is no longer under consideration for Trump and the Republican Party, which is shown by our just one poll here since President Biden withdrew from the race.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Nevertheless, Trump ended up winning by 3.4%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Losing all three would definitely cut Harris's route to 270 electoral votes off course.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala Harris's lead falls to 2.7% now, with a two-point change to the poll average.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Polling Harris's 48.2% at 48.7% 11 polls total make up this average.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Correcting for 2.5% historical polling error, Trump's lead rises from 0.5% to precisely 3%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Based on average of the most recent seven polls by real clear polling, Trump leads by 7.4%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Pennsylvanian polls historically have understated Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"With two states to go now, Trump rises above the 270 mark and earns 296 electoral votes, so guaranteeing his victory.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Recall Biden had trailed Trump here while he was still running.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She hasn't quite lost her edge here yet.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Brand new points suggest that Donald Trump is about to win Arizona in a landslide.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And compare that even to 2016 where Trump won Arizona, he won it by four points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, right now they found Trump up by 8%, which is an eight point shift from 2020.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She's done the Sunbelt.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I just don't see how Trump wins Arizona by this much, but by some miracle loses North Carolina.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And it's not just the polls have Trump up by just one point.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"No, no, the majority of the polls have Trump winning Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Meanwhile, CBS news insider advantage, they found Trump up by three.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump plus three and a half, yeah, we have Trump plus three, Trump plus four out of Arizona from, from Atlas Intel, which most people would agree is one of the best pollsters out there.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So that means you have five polls right now that has Trump winning Arizona by at least three points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They're all showing Trump's up by at least three points to at most eight points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"They found Harris up by one to two points, but you could argue the wall street journal poll.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It should be kicked off the average, but CNN, they found Harris up by a point.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's just a fact, but by some miracle CNN found Harris is going to lose the independent vote, but win Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Literally every other pollster has Trump up in Arizona by two, three, even five to eight points as of now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, does this mean Trump's going to win Arizona by like five to six points: i'm not saying that right now, but it's becoming apparent to that Trump's going to win Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump is going to win Arizona if the election was held today.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And quite frankly, I don't see how much changes in the next week to magically give Harris Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I just don't see it because if they look only at the average, like, okay, let's just say Trump on the RCP average right now is only up by one, even though the wall street journal and CNN, they're inflating the average fine.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And at the very last second, you had polls decide to show Trump up by four points and he won by three and a half.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, so back in 2020 and 2016, the polls were saying Clinton Biden, they're going to win Arizona by a lot, but at the very last second, it either became a tide race or it was actually Trump's up by a lot right now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's actually winning Arizona by four to five points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's what happened, and there's a good chance that when the wall street journal and the CNN poll, when they're kicked off the average, probably not the CNN poll, but the wall street journal, there's a good chance that when they include Atlas Intel's brand new poll, you're probably talking about Trump plus two, Trump plus three, maybe Trump plus four.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So it's crazy to suggest that Trump is not going to just win Arizona, but he's going to win it by like three to four points, which I'm not even saying it's going to for sure happen.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You have a bunch of polls showing Trump up by three, four, five, seven points in Arizona right now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But polls are not the only things suggesting that Trump's going to win Arizona by quite a bit.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We're finding Trump's going to probably win Arizona by like three to four points, maybe by even more.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If it gets so bad for Democrats, there's a legitimate possibility that Trump could win Arizona by some crazy margin like Trump plus four, Trump plus five, which I'm not saying it's going to happen.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"No, no one should expect that, but if the early voting trends continue and the polls continue trending the way they are, would it really be crazy to suggest that maybe Trump's going to win Arizona by some crazy margin compared to 2020: it's entirely possible.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Now it does make sense because both these polls have Trump winning Arizona by like four to eight points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And I really believe that's the margin of victory Trump needs to have for Carrie Lake to barely win.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But if Trump really wins Arizona by five, six, seven, eight points, which that's what data orbital is suggesting.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But if the trends continue and Trump actually wins Arizona by four points, you're talking about 50, 50 race.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If it's Trump plus five, Carrie Lake is probably the favorite.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I still think Ruben Gallego is the favorite, but it's a different story of Trump is really winning by three, four, five points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's why I thought Trump needed to win by for Carrie Lake to barely win by like three to five points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Right now, there's been a bunch of polls out of Arizona showing Trump winning by three, four, five, even eight points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But if it really is Trump plus four, Trump plus five, like the polls are showing, she could actually win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And the only way forward, the only way forward is to elect Kamala Harris as our next president, and Tim Woz as our next vice president, and cast that vote now.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the— Hey, guys, you know what: here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"After their contentious debate, the pair putting differences aside to come together at the memorial marking the 23rd anniversary of September 11th.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But it comes as Trump is facing controversy over connections to conspiracy theories.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Earlier this week, Loomer sharing a racist post about Harris, who's the child of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, suggesting if Harris wins, the White House will smell like curry, among other things.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Urging Trump to stay focused on issues like the economy and protecting the border.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think the more he can stick to those issues, I think the better off that he is going to be as he goes forward.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The Harris team is calling this the New Way Forward Tour.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"A campaign official tells NBC News her team is entering a new, more aggressive phase.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Since Harris became the presumptive nominee, another campaign official said more than 20,000 new volunteers have signed up.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
WRL's Laura Levine will have live coverage of Harris' visit later tonight.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Noah, meantime, former President Donald Trump is set to make his second trip to southern Arizona in less than 30 days.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But before he could appear in Tucson a second time, his campaign had to make a deposit of $145,000 up front.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That required deposit came about because he failed to pay an $81,000 bill from a campaign event at the Tucson Convention Center from 2016.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump is scheduled to begin speaking at 5 p.m. More time.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Washington Post reports this quote, the six-month GOP driven review confirmed the accuracy of the results according to a report released last month, but that hasn't silenced Trump who continues to make false claims or those of other Republicans including several Arizona lawmakers on the House Committee.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We saw what happened when Trump supporters tried to stop the certification of the actual accurate results.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump refused to accept the results and unfortunately we have one of the world's great political parties which has followed him off of the ledge of this electoral lunacy.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And at this point, you know, uh, Jamie Raskin put it quite appropriately when he called it electoral lunacy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It'll be a big event though because there is an expectation that some 40,000 people will be there Also today relating to Kamala Harris a bit of an oopsie moment She was caught on a hot hot mic from a couple of days ago complaining about her inability to woo male voters Oh Kenny the old hot mic so as I mentioned we are broadcasting live from Nogales in southern Arizona this morning.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Both of the presidential candidates here in the Sunbelt Western States today Arizona here where we expect shortly to see Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
You could practically smell her desperation coming from a mile away.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Because if she had any inkling of care about the border, aside from trying to scrounge around for votes, she would have visited the border a hell of a lot sooner than what she did recently.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It's awesome, to say the least, we're gonna be playing you some footage from Fox News and from the Hannity exclusive, which showcases the border crisis and how Kakamala Harris is trying to handle it, which is to say, not at all.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But before we begin this commentary, please don't forget to subscribe, share this with your friends, to show as many people as possible what it is that Kakamala Harris is trying to do.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That being said, Donald Trump still is in the lead currently in Arizona by 3%, according to this image right here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Like I said at the beginning, if Kakamala Harris wasn't desperate for voters, there's no way she would have visited the border recently.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He apparently has connections with the governor of Arizona, and he's been doing his best to get Kakamala Harris over there, just to see what the border looks like.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And he stated that although he's glad that she's finally visiting the border, why did it take this long to do it: well it's quite simple really, it's because Kakamala Harris has no value and she doesn't support anything that she says.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And you know what's funny about this is that apparently she's trying to introduce a bill that quote-unquote fixes the border problem.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
You want to know what that border bill actually does: i think we'll go ahead and let Donald Trump and Sean Hannity say it for us.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump got 600 K. So the Democrat firewall was 1.4 million vote advantage going into election day.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Do you really think a 500 K advantage for Harris means a victory: and that comes from this post, which is this liberal person talking about the Democrats and their current firewall plus 294 K saying they're around three fourths of the way to getting 400 K, which doesn't make a lot of sense.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He is currently the betting favorite and it's more so Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump is winning it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And that's why you see a Morris with a, you know, just pathetic, horrible poll that has Harris plus five.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You know, they, they, they should just have Harris winning honestly.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yeah, i mean, Trump's doing very well, but it is very early voting there.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So the Republican electorate advantage in Arizona in 2020 was around four points and Trump barely lost the state by less than a point.,Donald Trump,Arizona
We've been saying it's about a three and a half point victory in Arizona for Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
It's going to be the easiest swing state for either candidate to win is Arizona going for Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"If you get a plus eight Republican electorate advantage, cause it was plus four and Trump barely lost.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I know people, a lot of Republicans they're not too fond of Kerry Lake, but if, I mean, listen, there's possible Trump takes us by four and a half.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's the forecast right now, you've got five 38 now and their sham model admitting, all right, Trump's going to win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's, you know, it is what it is, but all the betting saying Trump's going to win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Boy, we would have to see some crazy deviation deviation for Kamala Harris to win this election.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"This is, this is a popular victory for Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And I just think the reality is that we have seen a movement towards Vice President Harris among these kind of former disaffected Republican types.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
But you can sense that there is real potential ground to be tilled here for the Harris campaign.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
The Harris campaign knows it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
That's why my colleague Sarah Longwell is there again today with Liz Cheney and Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yeah, and so I want to talk about exactly that, because, you know, look, it's not often that Kamala Harris is going to bring like a special guest with her on the campaign trail.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Obviously, somebody that she's going to do that with is going to have outsized importance.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so the campaign recognizes that as Plouffe has said, and, and Kamala Harris is doing well with them.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she continues to grow her vote share among Nikki Haley voters.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And so I think that explains why she's out there today.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Like you could, you know, you could tell when people are faking that, you know, and she's very much not.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And I just think that Kamala Harris wants to make sure she gets every single one of those, like votes.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And I think that's a good kind of target demo for her to kind of squeeze out a couple more votes as we're looking at a really close race.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"How is her being on the campaign trail with Kamala going to going to confer some some huge benefit to the Harris campaign, what would you say to that: yeah, I get that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Like if she can, as many of those voters, she can pull over huge plus for Kamala.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And then the other thing I just want to observe today, there is another criticism, which you didn't ask, but I'm going to ask it and knock it down myself, which is progressive folks are like, should she be campaigning with Liz: like people don't like a lot of the Republican like conservative policies that Liz has pushed.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"On stage today, like Liz almost sounded like Kamala is kind of bringing out Liz's inter-liberal.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so I just, again, like I said, to me, Kamala seems to be really on from an issue standpoint, talking about all of the issues that she was already talking about that she, and she's really appealing to this demo just thematically and through a commitment to rule of law and the constitution and character.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so I, it's not like she's sacrificing anything, you know, on her left flank to kind of bring these people in.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Having these people, you know, basically start the conversation with Democrats like Kamala Harris will give a permission structure for a lot of these Republican voters out there to know that it is okay to like kind of like as a gateway to, it is okay to vote for Democrats and the policies that Democrats are espoused are not going to lead to the end of the world.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so when you, when you break that, like, you know, if, if, if Kamala and Liz Cheney being together can get some people to break out of that mindset, it does, you know, create an openness to rethinking certain issues and being more open to like the progressive point of view on certain issues.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But even back to her CNN interview opportunistic economy, she still hasn't explained that like what is that: chris Bird came into the debate leaning towards Harris but still has questions about what her economic plan actually is.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Anthony Dewitt still feels like Trump is significantly stronger on economic policy.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump boasting that his three Supreme Court justice picks helped overturn Roe v Wade, giving states the decision on how to handle abortion access, something that panelists Melissa Narves, who is expecting her third child, feels strongly against.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Um, there's nothing there's nothing new other than you know, he's shifted his stance now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris meantime stating if Congress brought forward a national bill on abortion access, she would quote, proudly sign it into law.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
His statements causing tension to erupt.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
What's her plan: i know what he did.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He talks great game, but he really doesn't carry through.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So immigration, Erin, has been kind of a liability for Vice President Kamala Harris as she's running for president now.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I think she has a really good answer on this, which is they tried to get something done politically that would have actually solved the problem.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But I think she's at least kind of fighting to a draw.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And it seems like from the presidential politics perspective, Trump just wants to keep talking about it, to keep it alive as an issue.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Matt, safe to say Republicans will find something to talk about on immigration, even if Harris is at the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Oh, there's no doubt, i think it's a mistake for Harris to be out here going to the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I think every minute she spends talking about illegal immigration and border security is a lost opportunity for her because the record that the Biden and Harris administration have on this issue is so abysmal.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I think they want to feel like Harris cares about this issue.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"We see that polling again and again and again, i think she tries to check the box and kind of get over that and neutralize it a little bit.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Some of the polling numbers on the economy, she's come way back.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It's been really interesting to see, she's kind of got that to an even.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And most people don't like Donald Trump's personality.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"They feel like he's kind of a crazy, weird guy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She's showing that she cares about it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I do think, I mean, this is I just laugh because was it politically craven when Trump was at the border last week, you know what I mean: like everyone's trying to do the same thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The reality of the situation is I think she's trying to get it to closer to neutral, to your point, and then give people permission to vote for her.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
We've seen polls that show Vice President Harris up by a couple.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
There was a poll out today that said he's up five.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I don't know whether that's accurate, but I do suspect he is up by a few.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I think that is bolstered by looking at the other polls and seeing where he has made up ground against the Democrats, particularly among Hispanic voters and Hispanic men.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Aaron, do you agree, if you had to be one of these candidates in Arizona right now, is it better to be Trump: just to be clear, I couldn't spend a minute inside the skin of Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's not who Donald Trump is.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"By the way, he's also really old.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And I think Harris has a chance.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris has actually been running from an economic perspective, a much more conservative campaign than Biden was.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's not talking about wealth taxes and all those other things.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's talking about a tax cut for 100 million Americans.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's talking about, I think there was a whole thing on starting small businesses and tax credits.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's actually playing more of that centrist economic music right now than Joe Biden was, for whatever reason.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But I think she definitely has a chance.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If Trump wins Arizona by a handful of points, it seems hard to believe that he would outperform Kerry Lake by that much.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But man, people seem to have really made up their minds about her.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And she has just bled a lot of support among the old McCain voters, of which there are many.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so that is really hurting her, and Ruben Gallego has run a smart campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And he is outspending her and outraising her about three plus to one, so that's a huge problem if you're Kerry Lake.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Aaron, do you agree with Matt's assessment that the race for Senate seems to be at least at this point Gallegos to lose: yeah, for sure.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But he made that incredible quote of saying our job is to call balls and strikes.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I think 2016 because Arpaio lost when Trump won.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"All right, Aaron, we got about 45 seconds left.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now they all traversed through Mexico to get to our back door, but law enforcement down here, say Vice President Kamala Harris, was virtually hands off on the issue and really downplayed the crisis.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
They've kept detention at a minimum.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
They have leaned heavily on parole programs as legal pathways and they've provided millions of federal funding to volunteer groups.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now Marnie, you heard from Sheriff Daniels there who has been extending the invitation to Vice President Harris for three and a half years.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But Kamala Harris is debuting a new ad today talking about border security, talking about that she's going to enforce the law.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's going to secure the border, different things like that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Now she's also expected to talk about fighting the flow of fentanyl and getting additional screening machines for the ports of entry and things like that to double down on preventing that deadly drug from getting into the nation.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
It is an argument that is full of hate and division He insults Latinos scapegoats immigrants and it's not just what he says it's what he will do if Elected you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies Only on a much greater scale than last time and it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump So five days out and it all comes down to this we are here together and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life and Your busy schedules you have taken the time to be here Because I know we all love our country.,Donald Trump,Arizona

Hey guys, you know what, here's the thing Let's talk for a moment about Gaza We all want this war to end and get the hostages out And I will work on it full time when I am elected president as I've been And I have yours So there's a contrast in this election on so many issues, including our plans for America's economy Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest corporations and this time he will pay for it And this time his plan is a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported Clothes, food, toys, cell phones A Trump sales tax, according to the Economist, would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act Also known as Obamacare And he has a powerful friend in Congress, the Speaker of the House, who recently said If Trump wins, there will be, quote, no Obamacare Which would throw, understand the meaning of that It would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance And take us back to the time which we remember when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions Well, we are not going back We are not going back We are not going back We are not going back And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body And not have her government tell her what to do And remember how we got here Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade And they did as he intended And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban Many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest, which is immoral And Donald Trump's not done Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday, that he will do what he wants, quote, and here's where I'm going to quote Whether the women like it or not And we must vote because this is the thing You know, there's a saying that you've got to listen to people when they tell you who they are And this is not the first time he has told us who he is He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly But we trust women, we trust women Which is why, yes, we will vote because we also understand if he was elected, he has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds He will ban abortion nationwide He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies And you don't have to take my word for it, just Google Project 2025 Read the plans for yourself And I think everyone here knows that we can agree One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree The government shouldn't be telling her what to do Not the government Not the government So Arizona, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, I would recommend you vote yes on Proposition 139 And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States I will proudly sign it into law Proudly So Arizona, I'm here to ask for your vote Which I would be so honored to have And here is my pledge to you As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face I will tell you I am not looking to score political points, I am looking to make progress I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make And I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy So he wants to put them in jail, I'll give them a seat at the table Because that's how a democracy works And that's how real leaders work And I pledge to you to always put country above party and above self and to be a president for all Americans That is my sincere pledge to you And so Phoenix, with five days left in this campaign, my opponent is also making his closing argument to America And you've probably seen a bit of it, it is an argument that is full of hate and division He insults Latinos, scapegoats, immigrants, and it's not just what he says, it's what he will do If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies Only on a much greater scale than last time And it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump We are done with that So five days out and it all comes down to this We are here together and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life And your busy schedules, you have taken the time to be here Because I know we all love our country We love our country And when you love something, you fight for it You fight for it Yes And with that spirit and with this spirit, we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, the love that we have for our country Is to then fight for its ideals And to fight to realize the promise of America That's what this is about And I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller And people during that time would come together from every walk of life Together from every background, every race And come together to fight for freedom and opportunity Growing up, when I was growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked To give her two daughters the same chances our country gave her And I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love Who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out But never stopped believing that anything in our country is possible I have lived the promise of America And today I see the promise of America in everyone here in all of you I see the promise of America In the women who refuse to accept the future without reproductive freedom And the men who support them In the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future In Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before With the Constitution of the United States before party And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time Where are you, let me see you And I love this generation of leaders You are rightly I mean you guys are rightly impatient for change And you are determined to live free from gun violence To tackle the climate crisis To shape the world you inherit And for our young leaders, here's the thing, none of this is theoretical for them It's not political For you all, it is your lived experience And I see you And I see your incredible power And I am so proud of you So can we hear it for the first time voters who are here, although why aren't you guys in class, it's okay So Arizona, we have five days to get this done And no one can sit on the sidelines Let's spend the next five days So that when we look back on these five days we'll know we did everything we could So let's knock on doors, let's text and call voters Let's reach out to family and friends and neighbors and coworkers and classmates And as we do, here's my request Let us please be intentional about building community Let us be intentional about building coalitions You know, there's been so much about these last several years That is making people feel alone Making people point their fingers at each other as though we're not all in this together So let's approach this with the spirit That is about bringing folks back together and reminding everyone The vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us So let's approach it that way Let's approach it that way We will be the stronger for it And always remember, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power So Arizona, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard, do we believe in freedom, do we believe in opportunity, do we believe in the promise of America, proven leader, a champion for all of Arizona, and please send him to the United States Senate So it's so good to be back in Arizona and Phoenix, are we ready to do this, are we ready to vote, are we ready to win, oh, it's good to be back and to be with so many incredible leaders I love you back I want to thank Governor Hobbs, Senator Kelly, Gabby Giffords Mayors Gallego, Romero and Giles, Ambassador Jeff Flake I am so grateful to all of you for your support And to all the tribal leaders, the elected leaders, community leaders here today I thank you And let's hear it again for Los Tigres del Norte Okay, work to do So Arizona, tomorrow, Friday, November, by the way, Happy Halloween So tomorrow, Friday, November 1st, is the last day to vote early in person

of our lifetime And we have work to do, but we like hard work Hard work is good work Hard work is joyful work And make no mistake, we will win We will win And we will win because we know that it's very clear to all of us here When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for And we love our country And we love our country And we know in this election, we have an opportunity to turn the page On a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other We're done with that, we're exhausted with that And we know, and we know that's who he is But Phoenix, that is not who we are That is not who we are And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next President of the United States In Arizona, many of you know me, I'm not afraid of tough fights For decades, I was a prosecutor, I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in our country And I have won fights, I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners Against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students Against predators who abused women and children And we are fighting for democracy And that's all right, that's all right Democracy can be complicated, but we believe in democracy And the right of everyone to have their voices heard It's all right And I have fought for many who have harmed other human beings I have fought against the cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as President There is nothing in the world that will stand in my way And look, we all know who Donald Trump is This is not Because here's the thing we all know He is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power And in less than 90 days, it will either be him or me in the Oval Office Yes, we're going to get this done And I thank you, I thank you, and here's the thing Because we're really clear and we can all picture it We can picture the Oval Office, right, and if he is elected, on day one Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list On day one, when I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list And on top of my list is bringing down Sisé Puede, Si Sisé Puede And on top of my list, in that spirit, is bringing down your cost of living It's an issue that we need to address and it will be my focus every single day as president I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries I will fight to make sure that hard working Americans can actually afford a place to live And if you are caring for an elderly parent Look, I took care of my mother when she was sick If you are taking care of an elderly parent I understand what you are experiencing and my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare For the seniors in your life who need help and support Because so much of my plan for me is about the dignity that all people deserve Which is why my plan includes lowering the cost of child care Cutting taxes for small businesses and lowering health care costs Do we have small businesses in the house, i will focus on health care because this is where I come from I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the...

intelligence of women To know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly But we trust women We trust women Which is why, yes, we will vote because we also understand If he was elected, he has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds He will ban abortion nationwide He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk And force states to monitor women's pregnancies And you don't have to take my word for it, just Google Project 2025 Read the plans for yourself And I think everyone here knows that we can agree One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree The government shouldn't be telling her what to do Not the government Not the government So Arizona, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions I would recommend you vote yes on Proposition 139 And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom As President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law Proudly So Arizona, I'm here to ask for your vote Which I would be so honored to have And here is my pledge to you As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face I will tell you I am not looking to score political points, I am looking to make progress I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make And I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy He wants to put them in jail, I'll give them a seat at the table Because that's how a democracy works, and that's how real leaders work And I pledge to you to always put country above party and above self and to be a president for all Americans That is my sincere pledge to you And so Phoenix, with five days left in this campaign, my opponent is also making his closing argument to America And you've probably seen a bit of it, it is an argument that is full of hate and division He insults Latinos, scapegoats, immigrants, and it's not just what he says, it's what he will do If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies Only on a much greater scale than last time And it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump, we are done with that So five days out and it all comes down to this, we are here together and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life And your busy schedules, you have taken the time to be here Because I know we all love our country, we love our country, we love our country And when you love something, you fight for it, you fight for it And with that spirit, and with this spirit, we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, the love that we have for our country Is to then fight for its ideals, and to fight to realize the promise of America That's what this is about, and I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller And people during that time would come together from every walk of life, together from every background, every race And come together to fight for freedom and opportunity Growing up, when I was growing up I saw how hard my mother worked to give her two daughters the same chances our country gave her And I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love Who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out But never stopped believing that anything in our country is possible I have lived the promise of America And today I see the promise of America in everyone here, in all of you I see the promise of America in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom And the men who support them In the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future In Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States before our party And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time Where are you, let me see you And I love this generation of leaders, you are rightly I mean you guys are rightly impatient for change And you are determined to live free from gun violence, to tackle the climate crisis, to shake the world you inherit And for our young leaders, here's the thing, none of this is theoretical for them It's not political For you all, it is your lived experience And I see you, and I see your incredible power, and I am so proud of you So can we hear it for the first time voters who are here, although why aren't you guys in class, it's okay So Arizona, we have five days to get this done And no one can sit on the sidelines Let's spend the next five days so that when we look back on these five days we'll know we did everything we could So let's knock on doors, let's text and call voters, let's reach out to family and friends and neighbors and coworkers and classmates And as we do, here is my request, let us please be intentional about building community Let us be intentional about building coalitions You know there's been so much about these last several years that is making people feel alone Making people point their fingers at each other as though we're not all in this together So let's approach this with the spirit that is about bringing folks back together and reminding everyone The vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us So let's approach it that way Let's approach it that way We will be the stronger for it And always remember, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power So Arizona, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard, do we believe in freedom, do we believe in opportunity, do we believe in the promise of America, proven leader, a champion for all of Arizona and please send him to the United States Senate So it's so good to be back in Arizona and Phoenix, are we ready to do this, are we ready to vote, are we ready to win, oh it's good to be back and to be with so many incredible leaders, I love you back I want to thank Governor Hobbs, Senator Kelly, Gabby Giffords, Mayors Gallego, Romero and Giles Ambassador Jeff Flake, I am so grateful to all of you for your support And to all the tribal leaders, the elected leaders, community leaders here today, I thank you And let's hear it again for Los Tigres Del Norte Okay, work to do, so Arizona, tomorrow, Friday, November, by the way, happy Halloween So tomorrow, Friday, November 1st is the last day to vote early in person And if you are voting by mail and still have your ballot, please take it to any drop box in your county or any voting location by 7pm on Tuesday, November 5th And you can go to Iwillvote.com to get all the information you need And to all the leaders here, please help spread the word on that And we need you to vote Arizona because we have five days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime And we have work to do, but we like hard work Hard work is good work Hard work is joyful work And make no mistake, we will win We will win We will win We will win And we will win because we know that it's very clear to all of us here when you know what to stand for, you know what to fight for And we love our country, and we love our country And we know in this election, we have an opportunity to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other We're done with that, we're exhausted with that And we know, and we know that's who he is But Phoenix, that is not who we are That is not who we are And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next President of the United States I'm not afraid of tough fights For decades, I was a prosecutor I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in our country And I have won fights I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners Against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students Against predators who abused women and children And we are fighting for democracy And that's all right, that's all right Democracy can be complicated, but we believe in democracy And the right of everyone to have their voices heard It's all right And I have fought for many who have harmed other human beings I have fought against the cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as President There is nothing in the world that will stand in my way And look, we all know who Donald Trump is This is not Because here's the thing we all know He is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power And in less than 90 days, it will either be him or me in the Oval Office Yes, we're going to get this done And I thank you, I thank you, and here's the thing Because we're really clear and we can all picture it We can picture the Oval Office, right, and if he is elected, on day one Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list On day one, when I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list And on top of my list is bringing down Sí, se puede, sí And on top of my list, in that spirit, is bringing down your cost of living It's an issue that we need to address and it will be my focus every single day as President I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries I will fight to make sure that hard working Americans can actually afford a place to live And if you are caring for an elderly parent, look I took care of my mother when she was sick If you are taking care of an elderly parent, I understand what you are experiencing And my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare for the seniors in your life who need help and support Because so much of my plan for me is about the dignity that all people deserve Which is why my plan includes lowering the cost of child care, cutting taxes for small businesses, and lowering health care costs Do we have small businesses in the house, i will focus on health care because this is where I come from I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the... Hey guys, you know what, here's the thing Let's talk for a moment about Gaza We all want this war to end and get the hostages out and I will work on it full time when I am elected president as I've been And I have yours So there's a contrast in this election on so many issues, including our plans for America's economy Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest corporations and this time he will pay for it And this time his plan is a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported Clothes, food, toys, cell phones A Trump sales tax according to the Economist would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act Also known as Obamacare and he has a powerful friend in Congress, the Speaker of the House Who recently said if Trump wins, there will be quote, no Obamacare Which would throw, understand the meaning of that It would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance And take us back to the time which we remember when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions Well, we are not going back We are not going back We are not going back We are not going back And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body And not have her government tell her what to do And remember how we got here Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court With the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade And they did as he intended And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban Many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest Which is immoral And Donald Trump is not done Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday, that he will do what he wants, quote And here is where I am going to quote Whether the women like it or not And we must vote because this is the thing You know, there is a saying that you have to listen to people when they tell you who they are And this is not the first time he has told us who he is He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what is in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly But we trust women, we trust women Which is why, yes, we will vote because we also understand if he was elected, he has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds He will ban abortion nationwide He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor

I don't think that these are positive trends for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"These are certainly competitive states, it's not over yet by any means, but Trump seems to have an upper hand here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So there's a larger margin of error here, but we see that Harris is ahead by about 68%.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
We're going to need to see that early vote tick up and Democrats turn out more for that early vote if Harris is going to be competitive on election day because we're likely to see more Republicans vote then.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
That divide isn't quite what Harris would want it to be though.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump is winning men more so than she is winning women.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Right now, we're not seeing that, we're seeing it get close, very close, very competitive, but she really needs to run that up a little bit more, especially heading into in-person election day.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She needs to run up that score if she's going to remain competitive here.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So it's likely that folks are tying her to the Biden administration.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She is a vice president, so rightfully so.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But otherwise, there's very little to point to as far as why she's not getting more sizable margins among women and why she's losing a little bit of ground among men.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris has done a good job of capitalizing on that housing affordability issue.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
We have seen that Trump overwhelmingly wins folks who say that the economy is their top issue.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's not equal across these states, but we do see that she's doing well among the 18 to 29 demographic.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So, you know, I think that it is a potentially good sign for Harris here that Josh Stein has mounted a significant lead over Robinson.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But I don't know that that necessarily translates to Stein pulling up Harris, so to speak.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But whether that boosts Harris, I'm not sure.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I think that we've seen this throughout the election that some of these Republican candidates can't perform as well as Trump at the top of the ticket.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So what does this tell us about down-ballot Democrats trying to distance themselves from Kamala Harris: yeah, that's interesting.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So, you know, any sort of defection that Harris gets from some of these minority voters, that's really going to hurt her on election day.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris faces a conundrum.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She cannot campaign on policies to fix crime, inflation, and border security without undermining the Biden-Harris administration's policies.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But she must tout the administration's policies to validate her record and candidacy.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Under the Biden-Harris administration, migrants swamped the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"During her visit, Harris will try to improve her polling numbers by undermining her record by acknowledging the Biden-knowledgeing the Paris administration did not properly secure the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Political playbook outlined Harris' revised ideas.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris will argue that American sovereignty requires setting rules at the border and enforcing them.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She'll call for more resources for Border Patrol agents to do their jobs.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She'll propose new detection machines for fentanyl at border entry ports.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She'll reject the false choice between securing the border and creating an immigration system that is safe, orderly, and humane.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
More on Harris' scant plan to secure the border is here.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Winfrey had to interject to force Harris to answer the question from the audience.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And when I am elected president of the United States, I will make sure that Bill gets to my desk and I will sign it into law, Harris replied.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
The establishment media raised concerns about Harris' repeated attempts to avoid her record.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So our last one to you yesterday, Donald Trump spoke a lot about the border.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And then after that on X, he posted just a bullet point of what he plans to do when it comes to the southern border.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If he does accomplish all of those things, what happens to the southern border crossing numbers: the numbers are going to go down.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's what he did last time that he was running for office.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Notice how on his bullet points he doesn't say he's getting rid of asylum claims.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Because you know what: he does care and he understands that there's some people that have viable asylum claims.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And most people are basing their path to 270, giving that one to Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If you give if Harris wins the blue wall, the famed blue wall, you can see, boom, 270.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
You would see the math add up and he doesn't quite get there.,Donald Trump,Arizona
But President Trump has lots of unfinished business there.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So I was saying, Biden, last time, Trump has.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, Trump is there a lot, which suggests maybe he's not totally confident about it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, what President Trump says where it's going to be too big to rig is very real.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"President Trump, he took a bullet for us.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Immediately, I saw that the White House on my Bluetooth was calling, and I took the call, and was asked by the, I would presume, the operator at the White House, if I would hold for the president, which I did, and Mr. Giuliani came on first, and niceties, then Mr. Trump, President Trump, then President Trump came on, and we initiated a conversation.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The president interrupted and said, give the man what he needs, Rudy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He said, I will.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, the most recent polling from Fox News shows an uptick for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"50 to 48, the previous national Fox poll had it 50 to 48 for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's not an insurrection, but what Trump did was you have billions upon billions of property damage that summer.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Okay, they weren't supporters of Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So they can't beat Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's up to like three and a half.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's going to be up four points, 5.6 points soon.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Now they want to replace him.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's so popular and they're interfering, not only interfering, it's such a blatant attempt at trying to go after their political opponent with the stupidest, most arrogant, vapid, overtly partisan and political stunt.",Donald Trump,Arizona
They couldn't find that their dumb hoax regarding Trump Russia was completely fabricated.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So then they go after, now they're after this, they've indicted him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If 91 charges, he's still up.",Donald Trump,Arizona
How can you have 91 criminal charges and still beat the sitting democratic president: because everyone knows they're just simply going after Trump because they want to attain political power.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And the only way forward, the only way forward is to elect Kamala Harris as our next president, and Tim Ross as our next vice president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the — hey guys, you know what: here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"For some indigenous activists, their political efforts aren't just about electing Vice President Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I know that people think because of the presidential race they're going to help us, Nez said of the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
We're actually helping them.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump and his loyalists in the Republican Party are as laser-focused as they ever have been on subverting future elections to regain power as they demonstrated yet again at another deranged rally in Arizona over the weekend.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's now been over a year since Trump unleashed a violent mob on the Capitol with rioters who waved, among other things, Confederate flags.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And we know that not only did Trump sick that mob on the Capitol, he gleefully watched them on TV as they tried to overthrow democracy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he refused to do anything about it, as even his closest allies privately pleaded with his chief of staff to put a stop to the riot.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Honestly, they should let Steven prosecute the case against Trump, although they'd probably just make him share a mic with Merrick Garland.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's also remarkable how Trump has driven everyone so insane, they're becoming more and more like their fictional characters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We have to protect it from Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Oath Keepers sounds like a yellow jacket's knockoff about a group of teen girls who have to keep a terrible secret, although I would definitely watch a show about a group of teen girls, plus Donald Trump, who had to keep a secret because it would be only a half an episode before he gave it up.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But as we've learned throughout the entirety of the Trump era, it's very possible to be both dumb and dangerous at the same time.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"For example, at Trump's rally over the weekend, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell claimed he had invented a new form of paper for future elections that was somehow even more secure than the paper we have now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The coup attempt Trump and his gang of authoritarian dopes started shortly after the November 2020 election is ongoing.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"If true, it means Trump and his childish response might have delivered a Taylor Swift kick to his chances of carrying Arizona in November.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Even Republicans think endorsement helped Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump was first at 38%.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And with your help, 23 days from now, can you believe it: we're going to win Arizona and we are going to defeat Kamala.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala, shouldn't be running, she shouldn't even be running.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She didn't get any votes.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I have a feeling that he would have been tougher than her.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
What Kamala and her radical left cronies have done to the state of Arizona is a crime that can never be forgiven.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For four straight years, she's imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons all over the world.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she's resettled them into your communities to prey upon innocent American people.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If Kamala gets four more years, the entire country will be turned into a migrant camp.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Right: one of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country is the savage Venezuelan prison gang known as Trenday Aragua.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"As they begin to play a video there at the Trump rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona, we're going to bring in ABC's Alex Prashay and have a discussion about what we just saw.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But the same amount of time that we heard Vice President Harris talk.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she resettles them into your communities to prey upon innocent American people.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So what are your thoughts so far: well, I mean, you said that they're coming from dungeons all over the world.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And look, I mean, this is kind of par for the course for the Trump campaign.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And one of the things that I point out, Phil, is that his campaign has actually rolled out policy today, specific immigration policy today.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But a senior Trump advisor talked about how, you know, if elected president, he will plan to hire 10,000 new Border Patrol agents.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And, you know, again, we're a number of minutes now into this speech and we're hearing much of the same rhetoric that we've heard from Trump rallies all over.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, he was just about to double that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But clearly that's something that he personally has identified that works with with these supporters.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so that's that's why he's going there, all right.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so she's going to have to focus on those, getting her vote out.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And clearly, she's going to go with an uplifting message, a uniting message, and try and get those people motivated and mobilized.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump's going to the West Valley already.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But all he needs to do is just try not to make any controversial, if you will, headlines walking into this.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So certainly, you know, the Harris campaign is going to want to mobilize women going into this.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He didn't, a lot of his supporters did day of.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He told them not to do the early vote.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"There a lot of them are going to go to the polls this year day of, although Trump still is going to win day of vote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And then everyone thought Harris would pick Shapiro.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump sitting plus six in Arizona and you have to wonder, man, if we get a few more polls out of Arizona and maybe even Georgia, but the Democrats really want to win Georgia.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But Arizona right now, it is trending to Trump and you would have to think, I mean, there's been some really bad.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But if Trump can carry Arizona by five and a half, I think Kerry Lake will probably win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's got Harris up to 58 percent chance.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But as long as Trump keeps this close, I'm really not worried about that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And really, this is Trump signaling that he I mean, he has he's you know, he can talk to Putin.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He can talk to Zelensky.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, then why is he meeting with Trump: i think Zelensky knows that Trump is very likely going to win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Arizona looks amazing, i would say Georgia, the last five or six polls, even real clear politics, they've got Trump up in like all the last five or six polls by three and a half points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We all know that right now, some diehard Trump supporters are auditing the ballots from, uh, Maricopa County in the state of Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We also know that this thing is a total farce and they know that Donald Trump lost and we know that they know this because one, there's already been other audits to, there's been recounts and three, there's been other analyses that have been conducted on those ballots from Maricopa County, as well as a couple other counties.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And Mr. White concluded based on his analysis, especially given the fact that Donald Trump lost Arizona by a little under 11,000 votes that these 75,000 individuals who just didn't vote for Donald Trump, but voted for the rest of the Republican party.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Mr. White says, yes, it's very clear that this is why Donald Trump lost the state of Arizona because obviously you lose by 11,000, but you got 75,000 that didn't vote for you.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It's only going to embarrass Donald Trump more.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We've seen these analyses now, the voters rejected Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I will never be a Republican, but if I were her, I might look at this data and then think twice about hitching my wagon to Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
No doubt that that is the very clear policy of Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Vice president Harris is trying to do her job and supporting something, something that senators and congressmen will support.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And yet again, one more time Republicans refused to see that bill through because Trump told them that it would be better for them not to solve the issue that they're paid for by the American people to solve.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And so Kamala Harris has a plan.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She wants to work on Dreamers.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She wants to work on the 11 million people that are here that have mixed status families.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But the only thing that we hear from Donald Trump and Republicans is get them out, is mass deportation, is vilifying immigrants for their own political gain.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So for Kamala Harris, chances are very low to win from Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And Arizonans consider Kamala as the reason of their miseries.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Arizona suffered high inflation and high cost of living due to the exuberantly high government spendings and adventures, and still Kamala thinks of her victory from Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Biden Democrat administration with Kamala as the vice president did not materialize the recovery plan from the pandemic.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So it's very less likely that Kamala can get a vote from those sending their children to schools.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
The blue collar worker of Arizona received the strongest hit from the cruel Biden policies in connivance with Kamala Harris as the vice president.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"There seem to be confident that with Trump as their president, there will be tight immigration policies, which will result into a sharp decline of the crime rate and more jobs for the Arizona Arizonans.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Arizonans are taking Trump as their only choice.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But let's see what's going to be the results, only time will tell, but Arizonans will be giving a surprisingly landmark victory to Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The last three and a half years have been brutal, what do you think about Kamala Harris: i don't know if I should comment on that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I spoke to many Trump supporters who said that the border issue was actually their main issue.,Donald Trump,Arizona
This will be my third time voting for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump, i'm going to vote for Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's their problem, he's a businessman.",Donald Trump,Arizona
People don't like him because he's brash.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Who cares: he runs the country.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's who we need, look, Trump has his quirks.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump has a lot of issues that I wouldn't prefer, but policies is where I go down.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So I gather from this, you are a Kamala Harris fan.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Big time, she's been able to completely turn a quote, quote, sinking ship into back on track.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
There was also the anti-Trump factor simply not liking the sort of character who Donald Trump is.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Like she can't do the job, you know: four months ago when I went to the headquarters, it wasn't just Dwayne and four old ladies.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump will take to Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Harris has consolidated the Democratic base.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris doing better among black voters than Joe Biden was, a core part of the constituency, so movement there, as well as increased enthusiasm and saying that they're going to turn out.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So now that seems to be on once again, from my understanding, that is the only official debate out of the three that Donald Trump had earlier announced that has been confirmed.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She tweeted about that September 10th debate.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"All right, those are the words from Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, this was the demographic that Trump was going after through much of the race.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"This has been a truncated campaign, so while there is momentum, they have less they have less distance to cover, right: very, a lot easier.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The press conference today from Trump trying to push her into a corner saying, why aren't you out there doing interviews: the speed, it's hard to overstate just how important the messaging over the last five years against Biden was successful.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So, Shelby, you have new reporting on J.D. Vance and those accusations he's made against walls as military career.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he really, he was the first person I think on Trump's campaign to officially like loudly make this into a big deal.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We had seen tweets from it, from his advisors over the past few days, but he really went full fledged into this.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He argued that it was stolen valor.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He argued that Tim Walz has inflated his military record.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, we will tell you what he says about policy and you will decide whether to vote and who to vote for.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But I have to tell you that that claim is false because he already put three justices on the Supreme Court who created this reality.,Donald Trump,Arizona
This is the exact reality that he not only supported but used his power to create.,Donald Trump,Arizona
This is not a Trump story.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's the most recent Republican president to do it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He bears responsibility.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"This alone, maybe not Donald Trump's trials, maybe not Joe Biden's age, but this alone could capsize everything they have going into November.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"They saw numbers of 90s of thousand, 60s of thousand, 40s of thousand, the ballots drop into Donald Trump's category and then quickly come out verbatim.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Arizona Republican congressman Paul Gosar leading the charge for the election was stolen from Trump cause at the House Oversight Committee's hearing this week on Arizona's so-called audit.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"They held an oversight hearing on Arizona having reviewed its election results with this partisan, weird QAnon promoting cyber ninjas Trump audit.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Now Webster is one of the leaders of the grassroots group Arizona Republicans for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Their billboards are all over the Valley.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Webster still has his differences with Harris, but says he trusts her character.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Now are there things Kamala Harris has to do is Kamala Harris for policies I disagree with: absolutely.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's a Democrat, but will this Republican to Republican outreach make a difference in what's expected to be a razor thin election in November: it's still a red state and you need Republican crossover votes in order to win longtime Arizona pollster.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But Bence cautions that an anti Trump message might not lure disaffected Republicans.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They have to get past the personality conflict and they have to make it about more pressing issues if they're going to be successful.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I'm Craig Smith, we're live at Tucson International where we've just watched the landing of Air Force 2 carrying Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She is going to be headed down to Douglas soon after this, the meeting apparently a collection of helicopters and other vehicles are going to take us down there, down down her there to have some touring of the Douglas area and have a look at the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now word on that aircraft, interestingly enough we were waiting for Donald Trump's aircraft here a couple of weeks ago.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Pro-Trump protesters, some armed, gathered outside Maricopa County's elections departments in the days after the election, demanding a faster vote, while Trump's supporters in other states asked to stop the count.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"In 2022, Trump allies and the Arizona Republican Party attempted to steal Arizona's electoral votes by certifying a false slate of electors.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump is making it seem like people.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He said people don't speak the language.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Former President Trump may be out of the White House, but his influence on the Republican Party continues to loom large, especially on the state level.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, Kelly Ward was reelected as the state party chair this weekend, narrowly, but the folks she beat were also pretty hardcore Donald Trump supporters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"She was elected on the second ballot, beating out someone from Southern Arizona who's also a pretty strong Trump supporter.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He was obviously Mr. Conservative, but his type of conservative is not what we're seeing from the folks who are aligning themselves with Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"She has been consistent about this, she's an acolyte of Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"She says he should still be president, that Arizona was one of the states that was stolen from Trump in 2020.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"After almost four years, borders are Kamala Harris has decided for political reasons that it's time for her to go to the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's gone to the border for years.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"What a disgrace that is that she waited so long allowing millions and millions of people to enter our country from prisons and jails, mental institutions and insane asylums.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"When Kamala is seen at the border on Friday, she will pass hundreds of miles of wall that was built by Trump.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now when she speaks, I hope everybody remembers that she has caused our cities, our towns and our country itself tremendous damage.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And in only 14 days, we're going to turn Arizona red, we're going to turn America red, and we're going to make Donald Trump the next president of the United States.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I think maybe I'll have to take some to Kamala Harris for every time she does a softball interview, she wants to wear some body armor.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But they decided to put Kamala Harris out there more and more.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now, she's only doing these softball interviews.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And unfortunately, for Kamala Harris, every time that she does an interview, she makes our case for us.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I got to go around and just remind the American people that Donald Trump delivered rising take-home pay and low inflation.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's a pretty easy job, governor Walz has to go around and somehow convince the American people that Kamala Harris is going to solve the very problem she's been creating over the last three and a half years.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But here's the reality, is that under Kamala Harris's policies, she cast trillions, she cast the deciding vote on trillions of dollars of new spending.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And thanks to that decision, Arizonans are paying $1,000 more per month to buy what they could have bought when Donald Trump was president.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's over, that's over $12,000 a year, thanks to Kamala Harris's policies, Arizona is dealing with one of the worst housing crisis we've ever seen in this state.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And thanks to Kamala Harris's policies, Arizona is maybe feeling it the worst, the wide open border, the drugs, the crime, and the sex trafficking.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
It's because of Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And of course, we know that a lot of our senior citizens, the ones who are living on a fixed income, are the ones who have been hit the hardest by Kamala Harris's inflation.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So here is what Donald Trump is going to do, two big things for our senior citizens in Arizona and all across the country.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And the second thing, especially for our seniors, is that Donald Trump, we're going to eliminate taxes on social security so that our seniors can afford to live a good life.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I think a lot of our grandparents are just saying, could we get a little bit of help, could you make it easier to afford the things that I need to buy rather than harder: and that's what Donald Trump and I are going to do.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Fight for you every single day, we're going to make groceries more affordable.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We're going to make housing more affordable.,Donald Trump,Arizona
We're going to make the American dream more affordable.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And really, my friends, it's actually pretty simple because here's what's happened under the leadership of Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
It's always useful to sort of compare and contrast because I feel bad sometimes for anybody who's listening to Kamala Harris's interviews because there's no specifics.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"All right, so Kamala Harris's economic plan is to wage war on American energy, drive up the cost of oil, drive up the cost of natural gas, and drive up the cost of everything that requires low energy costs, which is everything that we buy, from the homes that we buy to the food that gets delivered to the grocery store.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You know, Donald Trump's plan to bring down energy prices is very simple.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is going around the country bragging.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump is going to lower your taxes.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, Kamala Harris wants to open.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
They came into office bragging that they were going to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump's plan is simple.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, there's a big lie at the heart of the Kamala Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But now she's come up with this lie because she's trying to scare our senior citizens.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Well, you know what Donald Trump's plan is to protect Social Security and Medicare: make sure that those benefits go to the people who paid for them and not illegal aliens.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So to every person who has come into the country illegally under Kamala Harris's leadership, Kamala Harris wants to roll out the red carpet, give free health care and housing benefits.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump has a different idea.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump's plan is pretty simple.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Our message to Kamala Harris is yes, we are compassionate people, which is why we want to secure the damn border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And the only way we're going to do it is if we elect Donald J. Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But most importantly, let people know why you want Donald J. Trump to be the next president of the United States of America.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I want you to talk about why you're voting for Donald Trump, especially on social media.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That if there's a, Kamala Harris put that sign up, ladies and gentlemen.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I'm telling you, she did.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Think about it, if the truck driver who's delivering the groceries to the grocery store is paying 45% more for diesel, and he is under Kamala Harris's leadership, then we're all paying more for groceries.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
You don't have to agree with everything that Donald Trump says.,Donald Trump,Arizona
That's what Donald Trump is going to do.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Frankly, he already did it once before.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But I think we're going to unleash, with Trump as president for a second term, a golden age of prosperity for Arizona and the whole country.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But we got to get him there first.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But this particular issue, I think that what Kamala Harris has done is she has used programs that are meant to help people who are escaping tyranny.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And that has to stop, because here's what happens, here's what happens when Kamala Harris grants millions upon millions of people legal status.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So what Donald Trump has proposed doing is we're going to stop doing mass parole.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"It is a disgrace, and Donald Trump is going to stop it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And that's something that Donald Trump and I really believe in, is talking to the American people.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is obsessed with silencing her fellow citizens.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump and I believe we ought to talk to one another.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's option A. That is what Trump thinks that we should be doing, encouraging more manufacturing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
What you've seen under Secretary Raimondo and Kamala Harris is them trying to say that you're only going to get money to manufacture chips if you do what we want you to do politically.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So long as you're paying your workers a good wage and building a great American product, Donald Trump and I will be on your side.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But this thing you see with Kamala Harris where she says we're going to hold your government funding hostage unless you agree with our politics.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But as President Trump said, it is what it is.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And it's going to be very fun to beat Kamala Harris on November the 5th.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I think she keeps on making bad decisions for the American people.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And we want to take away her ability to do that.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
We want to get to a point where Kamala Harris's bad decisions is something she can deal with.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They stopped doing it about a year ago because under Kamala Harris's rising grocery prices, they just can't afford any more with their grandkids that they're raising.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Because Kamala Harris has gone to war on the American energy sector.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So when we go out there for the next two weeks, as we're getting our friends to vote, as we're helping our friends get to the polls, as we're talking to people about why we want to make Donald Trump the next president of the United States.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's why we're getting out there and making Donald Trump the next president of the United States.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"This is considered the grand finale of Carlson's live tour, and it will also feature a former independent candidate for President Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He has since dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Outside the venue, we spoke to some of Trump's supporters about what they hope to hear from him tonight in this setting that's very much different from what he's done in Arizona up to this point.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I think that he is about doing something different.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He doesn't, like, have this shirt and let's get used to something different.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And so he doesn't do it the old way.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And we expect this to be former President Trump's last campaign stop in Arizona before Election Day, which as you mentioned is just five days from now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
This is his third visit to Arizona in October alone.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Earlier this month, he was in Prescott Valley rallying supporters there in just last week at ASU talking to supporters in Tempe.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Again, just really underscoring the significance that his campaign believes that Battleground Arizona will have come next week.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Sean, hey there Troy, good evening to you today, vice President Kamala Harris spoke for right around 25 minutes to a crowd of a couple thousand of her supporters.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris said she would be a president for quote, all Americans and not just for some.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris did not take questions from the press, so we could not ask her questions on the topic that is of course a major priority to Arizona voters.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She also did encourage her supporters today to get out and vote.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Her running mate, Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz will return here to Arizona on Saturday.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
The most recent president has been President Biden and Vice President Harris for the last almost four years.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And the recollections of 2018 and 2019 were Mr. Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But the question is, what are the policies of Mr. Trump going forward: it's not about 2018, 2019.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Vice President Harris vows to take on price gouging as a way as a way to combat inflation.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Let's talk about taxes, trump has already said many times he wants to cut taxes, extend his twenty seventeen tax cuts.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Harris wants to increase corporate tax rates.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump wants to cut corporate tax rates.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Right, and we're told that, you know, the Republican administrations and Mr. Trump will cut spending.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"They're going to spend, it's borrowing spent.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, they point the fingers at the Democrats and say Democrats shouldn't be taxing and spending.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump says he can he can pay for tax cuts and he can pay for all of this by increasing tariffs.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Mr. Navarro pushed them over the edge with with tariffs.,Donald Trump,Arizona
That would have been very difficult for Ms. Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And it was obviously difficult for Mr. Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, if you don't want your taxes raised and you're a high income earner, you're not going to be a fan of Ms. Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's probably going to raise taxes for high income people.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Right, she says not for lower income people.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I think the Harris administration would be more likely to let the Federal Reserve continue their fight against inflation, which they appear to be winning.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He wants low interest rates, low interest rates right now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But it would also be inflationary, we should mention that he also wants more executive control over the Fed, which that's right.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And this plays into her campaign message that we've been seeing across the trail that she promises and pledges to be a president for all.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
They've seen a translation into the support that we were initially seeing across social media.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"All right, we know Harris will be in Arizona later today.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"How does she hope to fire up more voter support, and I do note that, am I right about this, Nnedia, that Jennifer Lopez, J.Lo, is going to be campaigning with the vice president at some point: you're exactly right.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You see, for the longest, they tried to pretend like Kamala Harris has nothing to do with the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's not the border czar.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They tried to just disassociate her from the border altogether, act as if she had nothing to do with it, even though we all know that's a lie.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Well, now they flipped the script and now they're just trying to blame Trump for the border.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if you listen to the average leftist talk, you would think that Trump has been president for the last four years.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's how much Trump talks about it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
But now they're trying to flip the script and blame everything on Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I want you all to hear about some of these criminals that the Kamala Harris Administration, that's what I'm going to call it, because Joe Biden ain't president anymore.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
This is Kamala Harris is doing.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So I want you all to watch and listen as they explain to you all the type of people that are coming across our southern border that Kamala Harris has allowed into our country.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And Kamala Harris is welcoming them on in.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
But we're going to get even more of this of Kamala Wentz.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Not because I don't believe that Trump can beat Kamala, it's because of the other factors that are at play here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So we've seen what Trump is capable of and we've seen what life was like after a Trump administration.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I was seeing a lot of the things that she was saying.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And though I adore her extensive and very incredible history and education she does have, there was just some stuff that even like younger Democrats on the side really think are important.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
ABC 15 Arizona affiliate KNXV captured video of the statue of a naked Trump towering over a neighborhood in the state's largest city.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump bookend his remarks by saying that he would revert the name of Fort Liberty to Fort Bragg.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Here in Arizona, the estimated 15,000 people at Harris's Rockis Glendale rally took part in what's believed to be Arizona's largest rally for a Democratic candidate.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And the vice president Harris is a far superior campaigner than Joe Biden.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So why she wasn't there, there were some awesome folks who were there to really, you know, stand up and say, look, we're supporting the Kamala Harris wall ticket.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And I never believed the polls that had President Trump up six, eight points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And we're not trying to go back to where Donald Trump took us several years ago.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He thought he was facing Joe Biden.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is proving to be a far more competent and stronger candidate than many thought.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Can I have a sense of question, will Donald Trump continue to have a hard time dealing with a black candidate, let alone a talented one: well, the problem with Donald Trump is that when he doesn't have a vision to offer, he starts to go and he starts to personalize attacks.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, we've seen it when he was talking about the former senator.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, we saw it when he was talking about Barack Obama.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We saw it when no matter the race of the individual who he's talking about, if he doesn't have a substantive message, he starts to go personal.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's not what Arizona wants, and I think that he's going to have a hard time translating that message to votes.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Can Trump avoid going there: well, it needs to be about the issues.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And it's like Kamala Harris's entire record just doesn't doesn't matter.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And from that point, when Kamala Harris was attorney general, she went after drug smugglers, human traffickers.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She has a history.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Donald Trump, he talked about Mexico building a wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump, on the other hand, urged Republicans not to support it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The clearest choice yet for Republican voters, Trump endorsing Arizona candidate for Governor Kerry Lake, who was taking on Karen Taylor Robeson, a Republican backed by Mike Pence.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Despite Trump facing serious allegations of helping incite the January 6th attack on the Capitol and then allowing the violence to fester for hours, his picks for office are on the cusp of winning major races.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Bowers testified about the pressure he faced from Trump allies to send Trump's fake slate of electors to D.C. instead of Biden's.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Now he's trying to withstand a challenge by another Trump backed contender.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Gibbs called Trump the greatest president.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So Republican voters are going to be the one deciding and among Republican voters in Arizona who I talked to, Donald Trump remains a popular figure here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And his back candidate, Kerry Lake, was a longtime popular news anchor here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Phoenix, Phoenix is Harris country.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
The future that Vice President Harris can build.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
We will continue to prosper under President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And just last week, Donald Trump attacked the CHIPS Act and all of the Arizona jobs that come with it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If there was any doubt, he made it clear to us, Arizona's economy cannot afford Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump's plan will only hurt Arizona, rolling back the CHIPS Act, opposing a new tariff tax.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We can't afford that, it's time for a new way forward, and I know that Kamala Harris can lead the way.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Send Vice President Harris and Governor Walz to the White House, thank you, we will continue toizz crown day by day.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She will protect abortion access She will defend our freedom.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
It's not difficult to understand why Democrats are terrified while Republicans are somewhat optimistic about Trump's prospects when asked how members of both parties feel about this election.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana, South Carolina, Alaska, and the second district of Maine, with 126 electoral votes, Trump leads now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is not going to be able to accomplish such.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's most likely going to win by about 10 points at most.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Kamala Harris will triumph by rather less than 15.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Obama, Clinton, and Biden, the last three Democratic nominees, each get about 17 points, harris simply isn't performing as well as the prior three nominees, though.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Though she hasn't cracked 15, Kamala Harris is doing better.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
It hasn't been from strongest state during the last eight years.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump thus keeps his advantage with both the solid and probably states filled in.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He presently has 219 electoral votes.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And thus this is yet another aspect of Harris failing Biden from four years ago.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It is clearly becoming competitive, trump has absolutely a nonzero probability of winning here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Actually, I would guess his chances lie at about 20%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Furthermore, if you additionally review the polling here, two recent left leaning polls released explain why she is up by such a great margin.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Furthermore, merely using common sense here, Kamala Harris cannot truly win a state Biden won by such a narrow margin.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He is very definitely the favorite.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Really, just look at this poll distribution, he leads practically every single one of them.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But Trump has been ahead ever since, able to maintain his lead.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I expect the polling here will understate Trump once more.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Arizona visited Trump for 3.5.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"On the polling average, Trump leads by 0.5%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump has also been ahead virtually all during the election season.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He will score two to three points to win it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump is thus just eight electoral votes from the presidency currently.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He requires one more state only.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Furthermore, Trump has passed one three of these states.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And he just needed one of them at that point as well.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"For Donald Trump, this is quite welcome news.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump lately started leading once more, even when Biden was still running before his catastrophe of a debate performance.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Right now, Trump is once more the favorite.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Actually, none of the three surviving states are ones he truly needs to win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He is winning each of them by margins of about one percent point.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He leads by six, according to the New Wall Street Journal survey.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's going to win if he gets Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And Trump got just that because the Green Party is on the ballot.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But nevertheless, the more third parties the better, look at 2016, trump won the state with 48.1% of the vote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump would have won the state of Arizona outright in 2020.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if Trump is really getting 47% of the vote already in Arizona without undecideds, if Biden's down there at 42, let's say the end result is like 48.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It helps Donald Trump even if he wins Arizona by more than whatever the Green Party gets.,Donald Trump,Arizona
It helps him.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump now, even though you may say his favorables dropped a couple percentage points from like three years ago.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump is going to go out there and unite the party behind him.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"This is a state, a lot of people say it's not a very Trump friendly state compared to some other Republicans.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's why Carrie Lake is such a prominent figure and she's going to have an easier time than Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, Trump will be at 270, you only need 270 to win, but you'd like to have Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if Donald Trump goes out there, he's winning the popular vote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's an even bigger mandate that he has.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, this is a state Donald Trump can win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, Trump has struggled among those suburban white college educated voters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That may be true, but at the end of the day with him on the ballot galvanizing his own base, picking off Hispanics, and you see some of those college educated suburbanites, you know, defecting from Biden, maybe not to Trump, but to third party candidates.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And then the polls ended up being right, well, look what happened, those same polls show Donald Trump doing very well because it's across the board and everybody knows it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And even though these people don't like Trump, they also don't like Biden.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"They're saying, we'll take him off if the Supreme Court takes him off.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The Supreme Court's not going to take him off.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And even then, he's not going to be taken off, like I said, till the Supreme Court rules that he will be, and they won't.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So there you go, arizona looking good for Trump so far.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Former President Donald Trump is doubling down on his baseless claims surrounding the 2020 election.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He touted the big lie during a rally in Arizona over the weekend.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He addressed crowds of supporters during this event dubbed the, quote, rally for election integrity.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Mr. Trump went on to praise the Arizona State Senate for its ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He also took shots at the state Republican governor, Doug Ducey.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But President Trump came to Arizona this weekend and he repeated many of those debunked claims that of course once he does that, it gives it more oxygen.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And you even had President Trump saying, hey, vote by mail and then show up on election day.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So it could have been some of his supporters.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so as a result, President Trump has turned his guns on him just as he did on Governor Doug Ducey.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the hey guys, you know what: here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
No one has lost the state of Arizona more than Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He keeps losing again and again and again, even worse than he thought.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"For months, the former president has claimed that the sham partisan audit in Arizona's Maricopa County would reverse the results and somehow declare him the victor.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But overnight, a draft report of the so-called air quotes audit by a group calling itself the Cyber Ninjas found that not only did Donald Trump lose Arizona, but he lost by even more votes than previously realized.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And that quest continues, donald Trump demanded that Texas, a state he won, investigate its election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And overnight, just eight and a half hours after getting his marching orders from his leader, Governor Greg Abbott complied with his leader.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And also this morning, the House Select Committee investigating the January 6th insurrection has issued its first subpoenas for documents and testimony for four of Trump's closest advisers.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And that bigger loss for Donald Trump, Joe Biden, picked up 99 votes per the cyber ninja count versus what Maricopa County officially found.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump lost 261 votes.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Governor Greg Abbott caving to Trump's demands.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They are believing Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's the way you're going to get Trump people to stop believing the big lie.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Give Trump his chance to prove it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They've swung and missed every time so far.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"It has, but as more people see that the audits are indeed chams, that they don't prove what Donald Trump said.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And it shows that it was Republicans who abandoned Donald Trump at the top of the ticket.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They did not win for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They did not vote for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We may be appealing more to Donald Trump's base, but we're going to start losing elections.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Either way, it's Arizona Republicans for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And this isn't something you see too often on Donald Trump's side.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That Republicans are saying that that is not our party, that Donald Trump does not represent us, that we have to find a leader that we are proud to vote for to become the president of the United States.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So January 6 makes Donald Trump absolutely unfit for office.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And we're trying to push for Harris, who we believe will uphold law and order and protect our elections.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And the second young lady really had an issue with January 6, which I think is going to turn a lot of people away from Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Single-handedly, Donald Trump single-handedly changed the Republican Party for what it was.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"My sources agree that Arizona is the best, his best of the seven.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump is ahead, trump is favored.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So it's probably Trump's third best of them, probably.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And I'd make him the favorite there.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And my Democratic sources today would make him the favorite there as well.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So what percentage of the number of people who vote are black: and she can get her numbers back up to where Democrats typically are.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Two big ifs, she'll win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So some combination of her swelling black vote, holding her own with black vote and suburban voters, particularly women, she could win it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But Trump is the favorite there.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And I am up early walking Monty because I'm going to a Harris rally today.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They are committed to lowering costs, protecting our rights and ensuring that we all have an opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Our freedom and our future and the only way forward, the only way forward is to elect Kamala Harris as our next president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The Harris campaign is all about getting high, big name celebrity sort of endorsers and, you know, making carefully crafted statements and speeches and public events that are meant to signal to this community that Harris would be better.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I wonder if Klitschko is going to get a call from the Harris campaign at some point, right: finally, interference.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Former President Trump said today that Arizona must decertify its election because he won there and he won it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"All the other swing states, too, he is ready to be reinstated as president.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Why is it taking so long: he said today, quote, the Arizona Senate patriots are moving forward with the final results to be announced in the not too distant future.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But based on today's hearing, why even wait, yeah, why even wait: president Biden should just move out now because Republicans and cyber ninjas have fixed the problem of Trump apparently losing the election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Now he gets to be president again.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And he needs to get thrown out because he's not a real president.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's illegitimate.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has endorsed both of them, covering all his bases.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's also taking private donations from undeclared sources to carry this out, which means, you know, Trump supporters could be paying for the cyber ninja's company to run an Arizona recount about whether or not Trump won the election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"What the Arizona Republicans are doing here, this process by which they are bastardizing the actual secure election from November 2020, and they're going to produce some results that says that it was some other fraudulent thing, will be used by the Trump part of the Republican party and the Trump right to cast out on the 2020 election among their most fervent supporters in a way that none of their failed lawsuits in the past have been able to do.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Ah, Lori Roberts writing this week for the Arizona Republic, quote, anyone waiting breathlessly for Attorney General Mark Burnovich to launch an investigation into the fake Trump electors who participated in a scheme to overturn Arizona's vote should wait no longer.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Are you really going to ignore President Trump: we thought he could count on you, Burnovich says.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Don't miss your chance to be on Trump's team.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But shouldn't the state's prosecutor have at least a passing interest in such a blatant scheme carried out right under his nose: roberts continues, quote, it seems painfully clear that you can't be both the attorney general of Arizona in charge of investigating all aspects of the 2020 election and a U.S. Senate candidate who was chasing Trump's endorsement.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Burnovich's heart may lie with Trump, but his obligation remains to the people of Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He should resign, that's from the Arizona Republic today.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Calls for the Arizona attorney general to resign if, among other things, he's not going to prosecute the state's fake electors.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"President Trump, would you sign the national order if you had to call for an answer, would you sign it: i think they're very happy with my statement because they brought it into what it was.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I did that, and now he's trying to enforce it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He says he's our political leader.,Donald Trump,Arizona
How do we hurt Trump so that maybe Biden can eke out a victim: i don't think it's going to happen.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk and force states to monitor women's pregnancies.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And they are doing this because they think they are going to find some smoking gun that Donald Trump actually won Maricopa County.,Donald Trump,Arizona
These are people that are deeply into Donald Trump's pocket.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And so here we are with what I call them the Trump ninjas because the company is cyber ninjas and Doug Logan is their CEO.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So I call them the Trump ninjas.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Harris has said she would extend President Biden's executive actions that restrict asylum.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She would ramp up prosecutions against those who cross the border illegally.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
It was great to have her there.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She got to meet with elected leaders, talk about these issues specifically and how it affects Arizona, the state of Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Hey, she's a prosecutor.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's a border senator, a border attorney general.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She knows how to handle these issues.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The executive actions that the White House took, I mean, they had to take these executive actions because Donald Trump told Senate Republicans that they were not allowed to work out a deal with Democrats.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We actually had the deal and then he told them that they had to walk away from this because Donald Trump doesn't want to solve this problem.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He just wants to talk about problems.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So, yeah, I mean, she's she's prepared on day one to deal with this issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She said she would sign that legislation into into law.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's not the situation here, i mean, she is trying to manage and will try to manage a situation at our southern border that often gets chaotic and can get to a crisis.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So she's committed to working on this issue.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
We had some productive conversations and she's ready to deal with this on day one.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Of course, the vice president also put a focus on that this week, saying she would raise corporate taxes to pay for her economic plans.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The nonpartisan tax foundation estimates that raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, which Harris has proposed, will cost jobs, reduce wages and hurt economic growth.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Do you support raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent: well, I think it got lowered too much under Donald Trump's tax plan, where he also, by the way, gave a giant tax cut to billionaires like himself.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump added trillions of dollars to the deficit.,Donald Trump,Arizona
His Project 2025 plan is going to raise costs for families.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, that's Donald Trump's plan.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is focused on bringing down costs for Americans and American families on child care and health care on prescription drugs.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She cares about families.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump cares about billionaires.,Donald Trump,Arizona
We've got internal people saying Donald Trump very likely to win Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's trending towards Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"You can see recently we've got Trump at around a 66% chance to win the state, according to betting.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if there's a lot update here, you can see recently Trump has really expanded his lead.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But even here, I mean, since late August when it was basically a toss up, you've got Trump up to around a two thirds chance to win the state.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You look at the Sun Belt, it seems to be swinging to Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And I wanted to see if it had really had an effect on the betting and it has had at least a little bit of an effect.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So we're seeing the trend where Arizona, Nevada, especially Arizona, trending to Donald Trump, Trump the heavy favor, I wouldn't say heavy, but the clear favorite in Arizona and possibly you look at the recent polls, a few polls where they update all seven swing states.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"When you look at the popular vote, Trump losing it by a point that seems pretty realistic.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's going to be 47.6 to 46.6, obviously if that happens to where he loses the popular vote by just one single point, it's going to be, you would figure a relatively easy electoral college victory and you do have Trump winning every swing state here and it being split basically exactly how I expect it to be split with Trump taking every single swing state.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The recent polls in Arizona do have Trump up by half a point.,Donald Trump,Arizona
You've got a few polls that have Trump up by two.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, you've right now you've got Trump sitting plus 0.5, obviously very close, but it wouldn't surprise me if we saw more positive movement in Trump in Trump's direction when it comes to Arizona and then taking a look at Nevada.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You do now have Donald Trump because of that wall street journal poll with him being up by six with a very, very slight lead.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So Trump's made up significant ground there and he's also made up ground when you look at 2016.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"The final result there was also 2.4, so this has been a democratic state during the Trump years by around two points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It's a state that Trump can certainly flip for sure.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think that's a bit ridiculous, but like even the recent polls that have Harris up, it's very, very close.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And you can see, I mean, Harris was sitting plus one.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They're so close, which you would figure is good news based off of the polling error that Trump normally gets.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump sweeps all of the swing states wins all seven of them.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump wins Arizona by like two and a half points, trump wins Wisconsin by like a point and a half, trump wins Michigan by like point seven, trump wins Pennsylvania by like a point, trump wins Georgia by like two points, trump wins North Carolina by like a point and a half, like that's the margins we're looking at and then possibly losing the popular vote by just a point or maybe even under a point like forty seven to forty six, forty eight to forty seven, forty eight and a half to forty seven and a half, something like that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Let's see this, these liberals are school less on tariffs and why Trump's big bad tariffs are horrible.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Oh, that's so bad, let's see what they have to say about the Trump tariffs.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"A lot of the stuff Trump talks about, he still doesn't know how tariffs work.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So these like these smug guys, Trump doesn't know what he's talking about.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's only a multi billionaire.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He doesn't know how tariffs work.,Donald Trump,Arizona
We vote for Kamala.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
We've only had and remember this is the same Kamala who said she's not going to do anything different than Biden.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
The inflation rate is their fault and they're still trying to school us on with Trump's big bad tariffs.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, I don't know what to say to that, but that's basically for credit party elites like Obama and like others have been viciously attacking Donald Trump since 2016 and everything they've said about him is what they have always said about him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I think their problem isn't attacking Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Their problem is finding reasons to give people to support Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, he said today he insulted them.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, he first of all admits that they're not enthusiastic about her.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He said you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president and you're coming up with other alternatives and reasons for that.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on and told him to kill the bill, don't put it up for a vote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution because he wants to run on a problem.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But then Trump got mad, so Republicans killed the bill to help Donald Trump's presidential campaign.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, when he's not doing those things, he's hawking $100,000 watches.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Watch that, kamala Harris has never backed down from a challenge.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She put cartel members and drug traffickers behind bars and she will secure our border.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Here's her plan, hire thousands more border agents, enforce the law and step up technology and stop fentanyl smuggling and human trafficking.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And that's Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Vice president getting herself on offense on the issue of immigration with a visit to the southern border is where we start today.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I bet the Harris campaign has at least asked to try to make that happen.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"What is it about a potential second Trump term that worries you the most: well, they're the same as with the first one.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, I had problems from the very beginning when Donald Trump in, what was it, 2012, when Barack Obama came in, earlier than that, the whole birther issue.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I wonder, what do you say to those Republicans who argue that because they like his policies better than hers, that it's worth voting for him, even if they think he's not fit for office: well, all of us face that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And like I say, I know Kamala Harris, I know Tim Walz.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They need to be supported, i wanna vote for a president who knows the difference, and Kamala Harris knows the difference there.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yeah, I mean, interesting to hear you say that you think they embody conservative values even more than Donald Trump does.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That is a quote, which obviously is offensive to people who do have disabilities, but he says that on the campaign trail.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And right now there's kind of a honeymoon period for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That shows Kamala Harris ahead by three points, again, within the margin of error.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Democrats have a hard time defending what she's done over the last several years with this border portfolio she was given.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
They immediately default to that bill that got stalled that Donald Trump wanted to be stalled.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I think that's what's important, so Bram, Senator Mark Kelly obviously did not get the job as Harris this morning made, although a lot of people had a lot of reasons why they thought he should.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I'll add that among here, among organized Democrats, there was somewhat a sense of relief because if he had been elevated to the running mate job, if Kamala Harris won the election in November, there would have been an open seat in the Senate up for grabs in Arizona in 2026 in midterm election.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Vice President Harris may visit the U.S.-Mexico border during her trip to Arizona on Friday.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She'll be seeking to counterbalance former President Trump, who has made an immigration issue and has been driving that behind his campaign's issues and messages.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"No: he realized and inspired by this idea that he was able to really distance himself from Donald Trump, knowing from the cruelty and the way that he had completely dehumanized immigrants at the southern border.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I talked to a mother that is actually trying to figure out who would have custody of her U.S. born children if Donald Trump wins.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I think that she's going to continue to trail on immigration.,Donald Trump,Arizona
From President Trump in a rage after an Associated Press investigation finds just 182 cases of potential voter fraud out of the more than 3 million Arizona ballots cast in last year's presidential election.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"When Fox News mentioned the findings, Trump responded, and we put this up on screen, Fox News and other media outlets incorrectly side with the outdated and terrible Maricopa County Election Board to report no fraud found in the presidential election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Just as a reminder, Trump lost Arizona by nearly 11,000 votes fair and square.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I understand why Donald Trump's experience with the Arizona call was difficult for him, because it disrupted a narrative that he was trying to put into place that night.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He came out and said, we've won.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But when he said we won, there were one of the five key states.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And when we flipped Arizona red to blue, that meant that Trump was hit under the water line, right: that if he didn't have all this, this wasn't just one of those blue wall states going... No, this was a big flip.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So I understand why Trump was angry about Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And our reporting was, at the time, that Trump, where his people were both, were burning up the phone lines to Fox executives, the Murdoch family and so on, to try to change this call that you made, that your team made.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And you can look at Arizona and clearly this was a state that Trump campaign thought they were going to win.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump, Giuliani and that team has brought legal challenges to the election results over 60 times to no avail.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is set to make her first border visit of her presidential run.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
In today's video we're going to take a look at Kamala Harris' visit down to the Arizona border to see if that will have an impact on the overall presidential outcome.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"One thing to note, this is a stark change from the same poll in August when Harris led in both Arizona and North Carolina within the margin of error.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Now with these polls taken into consideration Harris going down to visit Arizona.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I've already filled out the states that are likely to vote for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
It's definitely going to go to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Again, a left leaning media source and they still have Trump ahead in Arizona by five points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Therefore, Arizona is likely to go to Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Even though Kamala Harris is set to visit the border this Friday, I don't think it's going to have a huge impact on the state of Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"However, we still need to talk about them because they are key states that Donald Trump could win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris seems to be pulling slightly ahead according to some polls.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And Donald Trump has a strong stance being pro-fracking.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And Kamala Harris is anti-fracking, even though recently she's come out and said that she isn't.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump won most of the key swing states.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"There was a long list of guests who included Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, billionaire Elon Musk, and Mr Trump's running mate J.D. Vance, there he made one of his final pitches to voters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump had lined up his favorite famous supporters for this rally from an old wrestler to the eldest son to the world's richest man.,Donald Trump,Arizona
These are themes that we continue to hear from Donald Trump on the campaign trail.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And he painted a fundamentally dark picture of where the country is right now.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So that is a message that Donald Trump doubled down on today.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Mr Trump's poll leads in North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia are between one and two points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Sure, anyways, but yeah, you know, to your point, I mean, no one really knew and now they've rolled them out pretty well and he's getting a welcome by the national media and by the Trump and Vance campaign as well.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so as Senator Mark Kelly, who was among the finalists, he was somebody people looked at as a military veteran who could help beef up that part of Kamala Harris resume.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I don't think people I don't think people will vote for Harris because of Governor Walz.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I think people are really going to focus on Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris still.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
They make fun of Harris for laughing.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And the contrast that J.D, vance and Trump is one that the campaign is starting to lean into and you've seen J.D. Vance was asked by a reporter the other day, they say you're a little bit too angry.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I absolutely agree, i mean, I think, you know, when they're out on the campaign trail, Trump and Vance are angry and, you know, trying to get you to think that, you know, America isn't on the right track.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But Walz and Harris so far are happy.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They're smiling, they still are facing headwinds when it comes to the economy and it comes to the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But they are at least happy people.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump doesn't smile, and now J.D. Vance doesn't smile, and I really, guys, you got to give people warm feelings.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And that's why I say, I mean, you know, Trump already has the base.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He doesn't need to pander to them.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He doesn't need to focus on them.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They are with him thick and thin.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump, 41.6 percent, don't know is around nine percent.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It was known, kamala Harris is making a difference.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Well, I wonder that Trump number seems a little soft.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So and also I do think Harris has some room to grow with women.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so I think she actually has some room to grow with women, actually.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And stay with us as we await Vice President Harris's visit to Arizona.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
He said he was asked by former President Trump and his attorney to call the state legislature back into session and to recall the electors.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"While this was all going on, while you didn't get a phone call yourself from President Trump, repeated phone calls, were you aware of this fake electors gambit that the president and his team was going through: well, I don't think we were aware at the time that it was an orchestrated scheme by the former president and his allies.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"With Vice President Harris visiting Douglas, people near the border are hoping to shine the spotlight on the most pressing needs for their communities.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Let's not wait, douglas Mayor Donald Hewish also tells me current policies are putting a burden on border communities.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He wants a new plan that puts less stress on local resources.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Mayor Hewish described Douglas as a safe city and one he expects will grow tremendously in a few years when a new commercial port of entry is built on project the Biden administration signed off on.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, it's very similar to what we saw just about two weeks ago when he was here last time, even the theme of today's rally hitting on those same key points, especially that big Trump campaign slogan of no tax on tips.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So ahead of the rally today, I wanted to reach out to the student Republicans at the University of Arizona to get their thoughts on how the Trump team is handling Gen Z voters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Arizona's top elections official is calling for a criminal investigation into potential election interference by Donald Trump and his allies.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Secretary of State Katie Hobbs citing bombshell reports in the Arizona Republic revealing a campaign to intervene on Trump's behalf.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump also attempted to reach that election supervisor leading to this voicemail from the White House.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's attorney calling like to see if there's a way that we could resolve this.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's a he's a Republican who took the same oath that I did to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States and the state of Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"How do you think moving forward, Vice President Kamala Harris has visited Arizona many times in the last year, I believe it's five times that she's been here.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's also been in Flagstaff at NAU talking about education that the Biden administration has done as well.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So clearly she has made Arizona a pivotal place to be.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She has come here to focus largely on abortion.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I will say I've seen her for those five times.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She is a very, very effective speaker.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She has a way of connecting with audiences that is rare for a politician.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I'll also point out her husband, Douglas Emhoff, the second gentleman was just here on Friday.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's been very effective here, and if you've been keeping track of these things, you know that our Senator Mark Kelly has been mentioned over the last several days as maybe not even not just a vice presidential contender, but a possible presidential contender today.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He threw his support to Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
What happened to Mike Pence wasn't an isolated part of Donald Trump's scheme to overturn the election.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Today, we bring you highlights of their testimony, beginning with Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a lifelong Republican who supported Arizona's voter suppression laws, voted for Trump and even said he would vote for him again.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Bowers testified about how he denied Trump's request to overturn his loss in Arizona by 10,457 votes by potentially removing Joe Biden's electors in the state.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Mr. Giuliani came on first, and niceties, then Mr. Trump, President Trump, then President Trump came on, and we initiated a conversation.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Republican Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a longtime Trump supporter, testifying Tuesday to the House January 6 Committee.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He was questioned by Democratic Congressmember Adam Schiff, who also asked Bowers about threats he and his family faced after he refused Trump's request to overturn the 2020 election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"This marking the third time the Democrat candidate for president has visited Battleground, Arizona since she moved to the top of the ticket.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It's not so much that we agree with her, but we simply cannot deal with a minimum of four more years of that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"On the economy, she said her plan involves $25,000 toward down payments for first time home buyers and a $6,000 tax credit to parents of newborns.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And Harris' trip to Arizona continues on Friday, where she's expected to meet with 100 or 150 people from the group Arizona Republicans for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Mike, yeah, and what are they saying: danielle about, uh, obviously they're happy that the voting is continuing to be counted.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But are they do they want it sooner rather than later, the results is that what they're just there to support as well: for the most part, the people I spoke with Mike are basically upset that, that, you know, a few people have reported that the state has gone to Biden.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"They're concerned about that, they're saying they want the official count before any race is called officially.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's what President Trump campaign is also looking forward to as well.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They want those numbers to continue to come in.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"They feel like they do have the votes there in Arizona to continue to flip it back to red there in the position for President Trump and Danielle also do we can we expect another seven p.m. Batch to be released: you know, Mike, I'm not sure exactly what time numbers will be coming in.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But you can see these Trump supporters kind of going against this guy out here.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Looks like he's a counter protester as far as the counter protesters.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Looks like he's the only one out here.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Danielle Miller reporting for us live in Phoenix, Arizona as election 2020 continues to roll on there as President Trump supporters continuing to wait for more results in Arizona to see if they can indeed flip it back to read there and really change up the race there and the vote count electoral count that we are seeing right here at 264 to 214 right now in favor of Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Can't wait that she's going to come down and visit us and campaign a little bit and I hope she comes and checks out the border.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Border borders are oh, let's hope that she gets some votes over her job she did as a borders are.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harrison Trump locked in close races in Arizona and Nevada.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, come on, donald Trump also has 48.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Kamala Harris, come to San Diego.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"After doing whatever she could to make the problem worse at the southern border, Kamala Harris has now decided now that we are what about a month and some change away from the election.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Kamala Harris has now decided to visit the southern border so she can do a little photo op and pretend you know like she actually cares about the issue.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Pretend like she's going to be able to fix the problem, a problem that she created, a problem that she plans on making worse if she's elected, but right now she has to pretend.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She has to pretend and a lot of her followers will follow up right along with her.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Matter of fact, right now as we speak Kamala Harris's followers are praising her appearance and the boots she was wearing at the southern border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's what they're worried about, they're worried about her outfit.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They're not worried about the fact that criminals are pouring through the southern border, some of which are taking the lives of women and children all across America.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"As she was doing this little photo op, the border patrol union started calling her out and putting her on blast on social media.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Here's one of their posts right here, vice President Harris has ignored the border problem she created for over three years.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She goes down there for 20 minutes for a photo op and decides to repeat some of the things the NPBC has said before.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But again, where has she been the last three and a half years: and I think that's the question on all of our minds.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And if you ask me, this makes her look even worse.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
It just shows that she's not a genuine person at all.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Let's go forward and read another post, vP Harris asserted in Arizona that CBP needed more resources.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Now they got to take someone like Kamala Harris and make her flip-flop drastically on everything that she's been about.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Everything that she's preached about and all of her policies for years.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she's talking about building more of the border wall.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"A lot of the stuff that Trump preaches about, even though there's a lot of people out there with TDS that hate him, a lot of the stuff that he preaches about, it hits home for a lot of Americans.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now a lot of them might not want to hear it coming from Trump's mouth, but they're issues that everyday Americans understand because we're living, you know, through this all.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So they're copying a lot of Trump's policies and plans.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But I just overall thought this was hilarious watching the border patrol union literally call out Kamala Harris as she's at the border for like the first time ever, 38 days out from the election.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Clothes, food, toys, cell phones, a Trump sales tax, according to the economist, would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday: that he will do what he wants.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"She said to those protesters, quote, we all want this war to end and to get those hostages out.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She said she'll work on it, quote, full time if she wins.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So there isn't a prescribed Trump policy position called the quote unquote Trump sales tax.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Number one, that Donald Trump is unfit, a danger to democracy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Number two, that her key priority is going to be lowering costs for Americans.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Just to follow up on your Trump sales tax point, what economists say is that tariffs do have the impact of increasing prices for consumers, because what happens is the importers pass those higher prices that they've got to pay to import the goods onto the consumer.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Selena Wang for us, Selena, thank you, wow, vice President Harris was there on that stage.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"LeBron James has said that he will endorse Kamala Harris, vote Kamala Harris there at the bottom.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And they've tried to make inroads and try to make up that ground that they have lost to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
The Arizona fraud produced 261 less votes for Trump than the original.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So he lost Arizona how many times now, Jody: five or six times.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump just tweeted last night.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump aware of this prosecutor strategy has been reminding employees to stick together and stay strong as a mob boss does.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They just I can't with the squid family dates back decades and it centers around their unwavering love of Trump the boss.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So there's a fresh off the presses new poll that has come out that is showing that Kamala Harris is surging absolutely surging in the Sunbelt states now I did do a video yesterday Where it was about how Harris has opened up a second path to victory according to the post polling model So there's actually now a second path to victory that's available and you can see this from these polls So what could happen in the election is you can either have an outcome where the traditional outcome would be You win the rust belt states and you could lose actually all of the Sunbelt you could even lose in Nevada It doesn't matter right you can lose all of them as long as you win the rust belt You would still reach the 270 required to win right the Democrats could win with 270 However, there's now another path that has opened up according to the polling Which is where you lose you win zero of the rust belt states none you win, Nevada, Arizona Georgia and North Carolina and you still win the election So you're actually able to win this election by winning zero rust belt states which in and of itself is super unlikely But it gives you two full paths to victory here And the other thing is you can always do wombo combos of both.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So if that if he's not on the ballot, this Trump's margin even higher So maybe it's a three to four point shift.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So it makes me feel better about the Sunbelt But I think they should do well with the you know black voters and minorities in those states and so she is completely surging in these states and I think that North Carolina taking the lead is absolutely insane and a five-point lead in Arizona is absolutely nuts And then in this Georgia poll they have 46 to 50 which is pretty surprising Highly unlikely I think very very unlikely But super fascinating see Kamala Harris surging in the Sunbelt opening up a second path to victory,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That the administration is working on addressing, donald Trump doesn't, you know, have a plan for that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"How serious are the threats, Senator: well, I mean, the threats originate when you have individuals like the former president, Donald Trump, and Kerry Lake, who's now running for the U.S. Senate, when they won't accept the outcome of a free and fair election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The problem comes back to people like Kerry Lake and Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
It's going to be a fair election and they should accept the results.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Senator, last night, Vice President Harris gave her closing arguments.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And they will be at the table, you know, some of them.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump cares about one person and that's himself.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He made that very clear through his presidency, but also that he doesn't really care about the future of this country.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's given tax cuts to a very small percentage of the population, billionaires, tax cuts to billionaires, and he's shredded our alliances.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump just wants to drag us back into the past.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Kamala Harris, she understands this issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She was a prosecutor, an attorney general.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I first met her when she was working on gun violence and how it affected trying to get firearms away from domestic abusers who were criminals.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump doesn't understand this issue.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"After the Parkman shooting, he said he was going to do something about it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump, again, he has no plan.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Kerry Lake is somebody who propagates election conspiracy theories, stands shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump and is and is even called for the jailing of her political rivals and elections officials.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Von, we also saw Arizona Speaker of the House Rusty Bowers lose his bid for a state Senate seat to David Farnsworth, who supported Trump's claims that the 2020 election was stolen.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Rusty Bowers became a national figure because he testified about the pressure campaign that Trump allies placed on him to overturn the election.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Let's vote for Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She heard the cries of families getting their homes taken away by corrupt banks.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump has focused on his economic record during his presidency.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's also associated economic issues with immigration, the issue he pulls highest on.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And Trump is advocating for extreme measures.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Some experts say that Trump takes his language about immigration too far.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But most Latinos, particularly U.S.-born Latinos, don't think that Trump is talking about them when he talks about problems with immigration.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"With a little more than one month to go before the November election, Kamala Harris' presidential campaign is working to get Republicans to vote for Democrats.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He has 48.7% of the vote, but Biden's 44.7.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is about as significant because ever since the debate, President Biden has sharply declining in Pennsylvania and Donald Trump has been inclining.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then Bloomberg morning counter poll Trump is also up by two.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So this is a key state for Donald Trump to win.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He won Erie County, he won North Hampton County.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And really, Donald Trump lost it around four, four and a half percentage points, he lost it by 17%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump had about 62% to Secretary Clinton 33.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump had 61 and a half.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"81% to about 18, but Trump didn't really get it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he gained margin here because of the amount of vote increase that Biden had in Philadelphia County, even though it did shift Republican by 3 percentage points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when you look at rural Pennsylvania, there's still a lot of votes out here for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He just has to shift the entire state of Pennsylvania into his column.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, but excuse me, he did do better.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Trump just has to play are you better than you were four years ago card like President Reagan.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's how he won, trump's doing better with the Tina voters as well.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So that really is going to possibly help Trump because the Democrats are still divided on Israel and Hamas issue.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But I think Trump is playing very smart politically, saying he's for exceptions, he said they ended the debate.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now in the red camp Donald Trump was at an election rally in Joe Biden's hometown Scranton in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, Trump's plan could potentially eliminate this burden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"While Trump's proposal targets reducing individual tax bills, his broader economic plans focus on offering tax relief to the companies operating within the United States.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
His overseas tax cut pledge contrasts with the policies that would raise the taxes for businesses manufacturing offshore with tax reforms estimated to exceed $10 trillion over the next decade.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, Trump's focus on tax cuts remains central to his 2024 campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She's joining us live from Washington, DC.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I think it's important for Vice President Harris to raise this much money.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's previously held major positions in the state of California as Attorney General, and so on.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But yet, the very public wasn't necessarily familiar with her, and although she is currently the Vice President of the United States of America, but as we know, the Vice President's role is not to overshadow the President.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So the question is this, kamala Harris, till the time that she became the contender, was not seen as a vice president who performed so superbly well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And she herself has been out knocking on every door.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I think she's very committed to not leaving anyone behind.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's very visible across the country.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And the campaign has had a robust public relations plan to go out to make sure that the public understands her policy position.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, and also for the public to understand who she is as a candidate and what she will bring to the table if she were to become president of the United States.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So I think communications, why her team has done an excellent job.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The last election with Joe Biden and President Donald Trump, Black women voted 90 percent for Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like, for example, you see LGBTQI Plus for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And I think people are trying to get things on the momentum, but also to look at who her opponent is.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he is out for unchecked power.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's what he's looking for, he wants to send the military after American citizens.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump on the other hand turned his event into a dance party yesterday after two people suffered medical emergencies at the event.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let's go nice and loud, so CNN's reporter at the event did say there appeared to be some confusion about what was happening while he was up there on the stage.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, he was supposed to be the door campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He just can't see them but you have all these balloons up here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's strange, it sounds like he got a little fed up with taking questions and went with an unorthodox way of getting around taking questions.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's a very hard argument to make because people think they're eyewitnesses to what the next Trump presidency is going to be like.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And moreover, those of you who are nostalgic for the Trump presidency and the Trump economy, you're forgetting all of the other things that come along with when Trump is president.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think a lot of people will be happy to see a Trump that's having fun on the trail because it indicates that he's more confident about where the election is going.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's a lot of back and forth about has she done enough to make the case for herself: and yes, that's true, you have to give people something to vote for.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But it would be malpractice to abandon making these points about the kind of fundamental threat that Trump poses to democracy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I think, I hope, we're going to see her do that over this final three weeks here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And then the campaign also cut, let's play a little bit of this ad that they turn around and cut immediately, hitting Trump on these comments.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I do remember the day that he suggested that we shoot people on the streets.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They also have some good ads where they go through a lot of Trump's former cabinet members saying he's not fit.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The problem is I just think they're for a lot of Trump voters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he wasn't a problem.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump was doing an event that was meant to be him speaking, a town hall, answering questions and talking about what he would be doing as president.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump just started to ask for music to be played instead and then he danced.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And so that's what we got out of President Trump with three weeks to election day here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's for sure, his play, therefore his playlist and there for the dance moves.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I want to ask you about kind of the new tactic of Kamala Harris as well.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trying to make that case to black men around the country that especially younger black men that she should be the one with their vote.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Tomorrow, Vice President Harris travels to Pennsylvania for a campaign rally in Erie, she'll be back in the state on Wednesday for another rally.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It all comes on the heels of President Obama's first event for team Harris in Pittsburgh just last week.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is ready to do the job.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice and a champion.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Vote for Kamala Harris, joining us now, Pennsylvania's Senior Senator, Democrat Bob Casey.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But we're going to keep working to get our vote out and to get Kamala's vote out to win this race.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In a significant development for the 2024 election cycle, Donald Trump has recently secured a notable legal victory in Pennsylvania that could potentially alter the trajectory of the presidential race.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This ruling is seen as a major win for Trump and the Republican Party, and it reinforces their stance on maintaining stringent measures for ensuring election integrity.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Trump campaign and its allies have long championed the need for robust measures to ensure that every aspect of the voting process is secure and transparent.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It also provides a strong talking point for Trump and his allies as they campaign across the country, emphasizing their focus on securing the electoral process.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In addition to the legal and political implications of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's ruling, there are also strategic considerations for the Trump campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In conclusion, Donald Trump's recent legal victory in Pennsylvania is a significant development that could have far-reaching implications for the 2024 presidential election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision to uphold the requirements for mail-in ballots reinforces the Republican stance on election integrity and provides a boost to Trump's campaign as it prepares for the final stages of the race.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's primary campaign message has focused on election integrity, arguing that stringent measures are needed to prevent voter fraud.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling, which mandates that mail-in ballots be signed and dated, aligns with Trump's position on maintaining strict voting standards.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This legal victory serves as a concrete example of Trump's commitment to securing the electoral process, which can enhance his credibility among voters who are concerned about the potential for fraud.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"By successfully defending these requirements, Trump can argue that his campaign is actively working to ensure fair elections.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This reinforcement of his integrity message can be leveraged to build trust with voters who prioritize election security, potentially swaying those who might have been skeptical of his claims.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This can lead to higher enthusiasm and turnout among his supporters, who are likely to view the legal victory as a validation of their concerns and motivations.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's campaign can use the Pennsylvania ruling to highlight perceived vulnerabilities within the Democratic Party.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump can argue that Democrats' opposition to these requirements is an attempt to undermine the security of the electoral process.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Securing a legal victory in Pennsylvania not only strengthens Trump's campaign's messaging on election integrity, but also showcases its legal and political strategy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The legal victory serves as a testament to Trump's ability to navigate and influence legal and political processes, which can enhance his appeal to voters who value these qualities.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Pennsylvania ruling reinforces Trump's campaign's argument that there are vulnerabilities in the electoral system that need to be addressed.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump can use this legal victory to emphasize his commitment to election integrity and contrast it with Democratic positions.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In summary, Donald Trump's recent legal victory in Pennsylvania has the potential to influence the election in several significant ways.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What is up YouTube is coffee back with another update and yes, it's another update about Trump What a crazy scene we got saw go down today in Pennsylvania And I was saying in another video not just what happened today how it felt so surreal and just like what the fuck You know everything from how it went down to his reaction just everything And then you take that along with other stuff that we've been seeing in the news as a latest just like man What in the world is going on in these crazy times: we're living in you know what I'm saying, but when I say that I want to make it clear I'm not saying that that was fake, but you best believe in the blogosphere in this internet era Individuals are most definitely saying that here We go everybody with the Donald Trump staged a shooting just to win the election First of all Donald Trump would definitely stage a shooting with fake blood and all that just to win the election Absolutely, I agree with that But think about it He would have to fake out the CIA the United States government is going to take every resource and asset They're going to make sure that this was real if it was fake they're gonna find out So you'd have to know that I am a fake out the CIA.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Epstein was never accused of anything until all way Knowing someone doesn't make you party to their crimes guilt by association is a nonsensical concept Trump hadn't even been associated with him for years by that point.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will take their bus tour through central Pennsylvania this week, making multiple stops across the state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"How might that be part of the bus tour stop from the Harris campaign through your state this week: well, we've already, we welcomed the second gentleman a few weeks ago.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Kamala Harris are hitting the campaign trail in the battleground state of Pennsylvania today.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania

"We've seen Donald Trump go to the suburbs of Harrisburg repeatedly, the suburbs of Pittsburgh repeatedly, and now he'll be in the suburbs of Philadelphia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But he's making the same argument to them that their lives would improve, same as any of these battleground states, on things like immigration and the economy, if Donald Trump gets reelected.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, Jake Rosen reporting for us from Washington.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Good morning, Vlad, vice President Harris will be focusing on courting specifically black men throughout this week.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I'm seeing it this morning as well with Vice President Harris unveiling new policy proposals that are also directly targeted at helping black men.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania

"That's a mass shooting right there and while y'all sitting here talking about God protected President Trump and y'all creating entire t-shirts for this man, where's the t-shirt for this man, where's the t-shirt for Yuvaldi, where's the t-shirt for Sandy Hook, did God protect any of them, did God protect Buffalo, New York, did God protect Pulse Nightclub, virginia Tech, pittsburgh synagogue, god protect that black church in South Carolina from Dindlin Roof: now y'all care about gun violence when Trump gets shot in the ear.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Let's talk about what that creator said about the polls and let's talk a little bit about what Trump getting shot at is going to do.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is at 235 points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I get feeling like, oh, like everything I see about Joe Biden is bad and everything I see about Donald Trump is good and being like, it's over.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
My part two video will be about do I think Trump getting shot at will change public opinion.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What do you guys think about what they hosted: the very first guy impersonating Trump, that guy is so good.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He almost sounded like Trump talking.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Guy the red rub was talking about how you know white people are so quiet at this point because it was a white person who shot at him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There's other person talking about how you know serious the situation is and people should just take him more serious.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This guy even said the very first time when Trump held his ear that there was no blood on his hand.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when it comes to crucial battleground states, well, the candidates are effectively even, with Harris up by just one percentage point.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's a greater number of votes than the margin that he lost Pennsylvania by in 2020.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We see the Harris campaign focusing on a swing county.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Zach, the Harris campaign is unveiling a new agenda aimed at attracting black male voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So don't say I'm not voting for Republican, but I'm not that behind VP Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Zach, what can you tell us about the man who was arrested near a Trump rally near Coachella over the weekend: yeah, Lindsay, we know that he was arrested on the perimeter of the rally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, that's verifiably false, harris has been anything but clear.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So, yeah, at the debate, Harris tried to claim credit for the Biden administration's increase of fracking leases.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Even fake news CNN fact checked her on that.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The Biden-Harris administration has fought a war on American energy production since day one.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Kamala Harris has said many times over that she wanted to ban fracking and transition energy workers.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"My opponent, Bob Casey, has said that he wants to transition energy workers and he's voted ninety nine percent of the time with Biden and Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Pennsylvania's do not believe Kamala Harris will not come after fossil fuels.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's a Donald Trump idea.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And no tax on Social Security, we'll see how Kamala lies about that tomorrow.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This is how it goes now, and then we have the lies that Trump and his crack team of wing nuts have been spreading.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"For real, this is really happening, donald Trump has pushed us to the point where we can't even agree on the weather.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They go around to Trump rallies to interview the people there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I've been hearing a lot from Kamala Harris lately.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It was a he and comes back a she.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he's mad at the media.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's been lashing out at 60 minutes.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He says CBS should have their license revoked for reasons even he hasn't come up with yet.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But they should be revoked, he's mad at Howard Stern.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he's mad at Whoopi Goldberg, who once headlined the showroom at the casino he ran into the ground.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's crazy, he was probably waiting outside Whoopi's dressing room to tell her how great she was after the show.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So why is Trump campaigning in California and New York: with states he has about as much chance of winning as he has of winning a BET award instead of the swing states.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That is Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, years ago, I went through his Trump brand products and found that the vast majority of them are made overseas, which had to be embarrassing for him, right: nope, not at all.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There are Trump earrings.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Trump camouflage oven mitt, the Trump football flask, the Trump pool float, not intended for use as a flotation device, and the Trump needlepoint flag belt.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This election, Kamala Harris and Erie, Pennsylvania at this hour, making her case on the economy, arguing her policies will help middle class families reaching out to black voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Tonight, Science Harris is closing the gap on the economy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump tonight outside Philadelphia is turning to the economy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You've been eaten alive with inflation and all I'm doing is getting you back to even Harris tonight focused on the economy too in Western Pennsylvania, making the case that her policies will help middle America and trying to reach out to black voters, stopping at a black owned business in Erie today.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
There is a very big difference between Donald Trump and how I will be president of the United States.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I cannot impress upon people enough that this is somebody Donald Trump who intends to take us backward and saying this about earning votes from black Americans.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It makes you wonder, why does his staff want him to hide away: one last question.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump this weekend stepping up his anti-immigrant rhetoric and suggesting he might use the military against, quote, radical left lunatics on Election Day.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's saying he is saying that he would use the military to go after them.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is among the reasons I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"As you know, this is my first visit to Pennsylvania since our rally in Butler, we're also going to return to Butler,"" Trump said at the Farm Show Complex.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump made comments criticizing Biden-Harris policies, focusing on the border and public safety.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They are letting horrible people into our country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They are poisoning our country by contrast.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's one of the reasons I'm here to support him and let everyone know we won't be intimidated.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Harris and her future running mate will travel together across the country next week, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"During his appearance, Trump continued to say that her selection as vice president has no impact on the election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The first question came from ABC's Scott, who asked about Trump's past incendiary rhetoric towards women of color.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump began, when Scott from ABC asked him to answer her question, Trump responded.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The former president continued mocking Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I didn't know she was black until a few years ago when she became black and now wants to be known as black.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"A new poll in Pennsylvania, a new poll of 600 potential voters in Pennsylvania conducted by Susquehanna polling and research places Harris ahead by four percentage points in the state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris matched him among voters 65 and older and saw support from white voters without a college degree rise to 41 percent from April.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Biden received 40 percent support among men and 36 percent among white men figures that rose to 45 percent and 42 percent for Harris respectively.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Biden received 28 percent support among self-identified independents, a figure that rose to 30 percent for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania found itself at the heart of American politics once again with a visit from Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"From education to the economy, their message resonated with voters eager for leadership and a vision for a brighter tomorrow.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Their visit served as a reminder that Pennsylvania is not just a prize to be won, but a community to be heard and understood.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The energy surrounding Harris and Walz's visit was palpable, underscoring the high stakes of the upcoming election.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Together, Harris and Walz present a powerful combination of experience, perspective, and vision.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris, with her deep understanding of national policy and her ability to navigate complex issues, brings a comprehensive approach to governing.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris, known for his common sense approach and his commitment to bipartisanship, adds a pragmatic and relatable element to their message.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Tariffs aren't unique to President Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's part of the problem with Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What she did was instead attack Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, but but she also really her message is that Trump is not fit to be president.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Sabrina, this brings up an interesting point, because when you talk to Trump, folks, as I do and I know you do, all of us do at this table, it will say, look, she doesn't answer the questions put to her.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Oh, no question about it, i mean, they're really leaning into the she needs to be introducing herself to the American people.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She needs to be showing that she takes these issues seriously.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And we do see that from when she joined the race, she has improved significantly on the economy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He's still leading, but the gap has narrowed.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The gap has narrowed, which is a positive for her, and what what her campaign is saying is the more she talks about it, the better she is doing on this and more so that you talk to voters and they're becoming increasingly familiar with her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And Donald Trump does have this branding that has worked well for him of this businessman, this successful businessman persona that can run this country like a business.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's the challenge she has that that really lies ahead and that Donald Trump still gets to drive home regardless of what he says, regardless of who he offends.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that is still that perception that he understands and that he is actually going to improve the economy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Joe Biden has joined Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania for a campaign rally, one of the must-win states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And it's not surprising that it's the first place that we've seen President Joe Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They've got internal polling data now that says they might even be tied.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So my guess is, and it's an educated guess, this will be the one place you will see him on the ground for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The Harris team has not committed to that yet.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He really is, so he dropped out of the race, said he's going to support Trump, and then found out he can't get off the ballot.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So he drops out of the race, says he's going to support Donald Trump, but now he finds out his name will still be on the ballot.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We are going to be talking about in this video, but it is important that we cover the fact that Donald Trump is pulled ahead in the state of Pennsylvania for the first time in a while that is with an outlier in there a Biden plus eight outlier.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's nearing 50 percent and then the Emerson poll trumps up by four in Pennsylvania in the Fox News poll.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump leads Biden 49 47 in Pennsylvania and that's absolutely huge because not only is he defeating Biden, but there's not a lot of undecideds.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's close to 50 and it was an accurate poll.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, the early poll for Fox in Pennsylvania in 2022 actually had Federman up by like 11, but they also had a lot of undecideds.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, neither does Trump at this point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He did not put as much effort into it as a lot of these other candidates who are basically vying for second did and Trump won at the end of the day.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He has a very high floor.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he leads by three and a half points and we could look into this further.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's leading polls and pollsters that are very hostile to Republicans and that are very hostile to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It turns out half of them are going to go for Biden, but Trump still leads the poll by three, which confirms what I'm saying that half of Haley supporters were never Republicans.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They were always going to vote for Biden and the remaining Haley voters would come home to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yes, he has to go on offense technically because he's flipping these states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So that's why Pennsylvania is so crucial, do I think that Donald Trump can run the table on all six of these states: absolutely.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I am feeling very good about Pennsylvania because there are a lot of people in Pennsylvania who Again, I'm just People are really clapping for that I told you I do not see how she makes it past 170 in the Lettorio College and it proves us right every single day They need to hide her continue to hide her keep her away She is far gone and lost this is it worse than Biden We know the whistleblower came out we know that you got to preach the questions and got the rehearse the debate We just we seen the whistleblower came out and said it We Know you got the questions and we knew that Trump wasn't was whether you wasn't gonna get fact-checked on your lies and That you dodged the important questions That is affecting everybody's life But look this is what this is what you get right here, this is what people are voting for look People love puppets And again a lot of people are mad because of clips like this hit the fan people are upset But hey, this is this is what this is what you guys this is what people are clapping for The left the Trump haters the anti-Trumpers The ones that's been brainwashed by the media the fake news They hate Trump so much but they this is what you're left with Deserved to be seen and heard that's why I'm here in Johnstown and I will be continuing to travel around the state to make sure that I'm listening as much as we are talking and ultimately I feel very strongly that better earn every vote and that means spending time with folks in the communities where they live and And so that's why I'm here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We're gonna be spending a lot more time in Pennsylvania I am feeling very good when Kamala Harris says she has no intention of banning fracking.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, what do you make of that: i don't believe her I Don't believe her because you can't change your mind just because you want to be the president fracking is an issue Whether it's Pennsylvania or anyplace else in the country.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Oh my goodness Yeah Yeah, yeah Fracking fracking And she won't she won't yeah, I'm telling y'all she's But I get she's nervous about Pennsylvania we know why she's nervous about Pennsylvania but uh You know as a so-called Presidential candidate And you get this You The Democrats are it should be and I see why Trump is skyrocketing through polls right now That everybody got to hear those lies from that debate That everybody's seen how biased it was a three verse one and how Trump still came out on top You Because this is what they what they what was all they had left I guess this ticket right here You can't make this up Who deserve to be seen and heard that's why I'm here in Johnstown and I will be continuing to travel around the state the most important and most significant aspect of My policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed fracking She's been against it for 12 years if she won the election fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But once it switched from Biden to Kamala Harris, they backed out.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's plus three for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So I think Trump has a really high floor, but a very low ceiling.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"His favorables were far higher, and I think it's because the economy did well under his presidency.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It was just Trump way overperformed his numbers by 3%.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And it looks like it's actually turned in favor of Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania for the first time very, very slightly.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So you could see Kamala Harris kind of barely hanging on with like this point seven point eight lead.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They have Trump plus two suspiciously, right: so let's see where they're at.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So almost six point Republican bias, and then we can see Patriot polling, another one, Trump plus one.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The only thing that would give you pause is the people that Trump picks are always really weak and he's a lot stronger than them.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like, for example, for the national polls, if you do like F of P equals 46 because that's what I think he's going to get.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The only thing is only caveat is I hope it doesn't end up being correct because Trump is a stronger pollster, a stronger candidate.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, yeah, good news coming out of Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris likely to pick Pennsylvania Gov. Shapiro for Veep prediction market, say.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Markets that measure a second order effect of Harris's surge are also feeling an effect while a balance of power contracts still has a Republican sweep as the highest probability outcome at 30%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The market is waiting for the first Trump-Harris debate to be confirmed, an event that could certainly move markets.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Democrats are a worried lot because Kamala Harris' numbers appear to be declining.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But now the polls show that the race has tightened and Trump is closing the gap.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You heard his words coming from him.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's talking about the enemy within Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He's talking about the enemy within our country, Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's saying that he would use the military to go after them.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Think about this, and we know who he would target.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And we know who he would target because he has attacked them before.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Journalists whose stories he doesn't like.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is a 78 year old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he wrote down his golden escalator nine years ago.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Kamala Harris stepped in, democratic enthusiasm went up.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But now the Biden-Harris administration's record appears to be dragging her down.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's what Kamala is going to do, she's been loyal so far but she's going to cut her own path.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Polls show that the former president has erased Kamala Harris' gains in the key battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and even Nevada.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that's where I think you see a stark contrast, right, kamala Harris talking about cutting childcare costs, right: having a childcare tax credit.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Do you expect that Senator Casey will run a little bit ahead of Vice President Harris, you expect it to be about the same, how do you look at the differential there: look, we'll see.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The rally, held indoors at the state capitol's New Holland Arena, marked a departure from the campaign's usual outdoor gatherings, providing a more controlled environment for the enthusiastic crowd that had gathered to hear him speak.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The crowd was a vast sea of red, white and blue, with enthusiastic attendees proudly sporting Make America Great Again hats and energetically waving Trump flags.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The enthusiasm was palpable, a testament to Trump's enduring popularity among his loyal base.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Many attendees had traveled from neighboring states eager to hear Trump speak and show their unwavering support.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Security was exceptionally tight at the rally, reflecting the heightened tensions following the recent attempt on Trump's life.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The heightened security measures underscored the volatile political climate and the very real concerns surrounding Trump's safety.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He criticized her record on immigration crime and gun control, accusing her of failing the American people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Starting with Franklin and Marshall, back in April they had a registered voter survey that showed Biden dominating Trump 38-48.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is post-conviction, he leads across the board.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He leads with independence.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He leads with enthusiastic voters, not so enthusiastic voters, and he leads, period.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If Donald Trump wins this state, it is likely game over.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What's going on in this election, and this is after the conviction, Donald Trump seeing a bump in the state of Pennsylvania in a pollster that is not friendly for him, and it's not friendly for Republicans, and it makes sense.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he wins it, you know, we have five months to go, but things are not looking good for Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump has been convicted of a felony.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"They look at this and they say, Trump is done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You got like, what, 10% of his voter base.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump didn't even endorse this guy either.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, you know, Trump probably wins the state by double digits.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump narrowly won it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump flipped it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And you see Trump's in-door seat, Mark Burns.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But again, I don't know what's going on with the intel because Trump's endorsements for a while are really improving.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think a lot of that did come from the fact that she did get that Trump endorsement.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"A lot of these Gunter voters, they're for sure gonna vote for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Sam Brown, he was endorsed by Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But overall, it was a good night for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Is Kamala Harris going to be the next president of the United States of America: for someone who has, um, you know, sort of claims to be doing good, but actually he's not, you know, he is tearing down the fabric of society.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But wait, it gets worse when it comes to tariffs with Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump, donald Trump is the Grinch that wants to steal your Christmas.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's what Donald Trump is going to do.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Which is exactly why we need Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States of America.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Are you going to work to help Kamala Harris be elected, are you going to go and talk to every single person you know and ask them and help them vote for Kamala Harris: yes!",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Is Kamala Harris going to be the next president of the United States of America: thank you everybody, I appreciate it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And some people are considering this a flip-flop, but Harris is saying that this is simply aligning her with the Biden administration, which also did not call for banning fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Most of the 50 states, it can be predicted which candidate they're going to vote for.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They're more likely to vote for a Democrat.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They've gone back and forth.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We also call them battleground states.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Pennsylvania is a really important one, some people think that it may be, at this moment, the most important battleground state for Vice President Harris to try to win if she wants to be president.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It has 19 electoral votes, and it is among the states that she would need to have to get to 270 electoral votes.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Pennsylvania for her is considered a big important state, because there are other states that may be out of reach in that battleground state alignment.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris is likely to win Philadelphia and some of those suburbs, and also Pittsburgh, perhaps, but the very far outer rings, that's where she's less likely to do well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So he doesn't say I'm going to ban, he doesn't say I was going to ban fracking.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he can keep doing that, i think that's a successful way to go after your opponent, is to talk about their record.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And she is actually changing her mind on a lot of issues that matter to battleground state voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So the state of Pennsylvania, we talk about how important Pennsylvania is to Donald Trump's chances in the 2024 presidential election all the time because this is a state that is the largest swing state, you know, Florida and Texas, those states are not really going to be all that competitive.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But also you have a pollster that had Donald Trump trailing the last poll called the Muhlenberg College poll.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It may not be a state Trump takes by any more than a point, but still it just matters that he wins it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, it is true that maybe all the polls this time don't underestimate Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm not saying that they possibly can't be underestimating Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But when you look at this, it's a very good sign for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump in a lot of the Western Pennsylvania counties sees saw gains even in 2020, despite losing ground nationwide and losing ground in the state as a whole.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Is Biden going to get the black turnout he got in Pittsburgh again: yeah, probably not.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Is he going to get the black turnout: he got in the Philadelphia area.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Probably not, and even then you look at some of these places really comes down to can Trump reverse some of the home region effect of Biden: i mean, seems like the novelty you could say is worn off.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So you look at it and it's like, yeah, I really think that Pennsylvania is a state Trump can pick off.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And it has gotten redder.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, you know, they usually have underestimated Trump by around six to seven points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump won by eight, and Pennsylvania, they underestimated Trump by over five.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And they're not really the strongest pollster, period.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because like I said, I'm not saying Trump's not the favorite.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's improving, but will it improve enough to give Donald Trump a boost: i'd like to think so.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's case in New York is falling apart.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Even if he still ends up getting convicted, i don't think it's going to hurt him at this point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But the polls have been pretty even nationally and they show a Trump victory.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So if the if the voter base turns out well, you know, I think it's going to be something that's going to give Donald Trump a boost.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But again, a lot of doom, a lot of doom, i see from people Indiana's primary Donald Trump got 78% of the vote against Nikki Haley in Indiana that prompted a lot of people to claim that oh, well Trump is having a lot of Republicans defect from him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Some of these House races you name it and they were able to kind of make Mike Braun underperform and make Donald Trump underperform as well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But if you had Trump's voter base up and you give give all the Haley voters to bite, I'm not sure.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, they were going up against Trump's endorsement and there was no Democrat primary that was open on the governor's side.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Am I saying Trump's going to win it by 21 points: honestly, I think he's going to win it by around 20.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He could win by 21 but still like to say that this proves that Donald Trump is Jover, you know by that logic.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But apparently it's over for him despite the fact that Indiana is like an open primary and Biden's not really getting a lot of votes.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If you want to read into it too much, Trump's in trouble in Indiana but apparently, you know Biden in Minnesota despite running up against literally nobody getting 71% of the vote.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, that's exactly the result that you get but still Donald Trump is fine.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"As you may recall, Donald Trump won all the electoral votes in Pennsylvania in the 2016 US presidential election by a margin of 0.72%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yo, yo, what's up guys: i'm about to take you through Donald Trump hood.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is Donald Trump's hood right here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There's a Trump sign.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let's see, this is Trump's hood.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There's some Trump signs over there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump fans, look at that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look at that, more Trump stuff, this is Trump's hood guys.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look at that, this person's really a Trump fan, look at all that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is Trump's hood.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's, that's right, this is Trump's hood, right: this is Trump's hood.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump, why you voting for Trump, do you love him, but you rather Trump than Harris, huh: yeah.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, this is Trump's hood.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This beautiful dog, look at this beautiful dog, this beautiful Trump dog, hi, Nola, are you a good girl: yeah, she's a good girl.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Three cheers for Donald Trump, all right, bye, all right, see you, Brian.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"See that, that Kathy right there, are you doing, are you both with Donald Trump to say you are you voted for Donald Trump, i said, I said, are you voting for Donald Trump, are you voting for Donald Trump: yeah.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's what I make, i make my Donald Trump video.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm having fun with this Trump's hood.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm calling this Trump's hood.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, all right, guys, little beautiful mountains, this is Trump's hood right here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We got Trump trash cans.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There was one Harris waltz.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I see one little one, i see one Harris waltz.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump Vance, look at all this, trump low prices, trump Vance, it's amazing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look at this, look at this house, trump house, you see it: get Donald Trump on there.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, does that mean he's going to win Pennsylvania by 15 points, or I'm saying he's the clear favorite: no, but I would argue as of now, Donald Trump is the favorite in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Again, that doesn't mean it's by some huge margin, but I would argue as of now, he is the favorite to win Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Therefore, he's probably the favorite to win the presidency.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"How do you think they're going to vote, do you think they're going to vote for Kamala Harris: no, I highly doubt someone that became a Republican the last two months is going to vote for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
These are new supporters for Trump for the Republican Party.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Even in that scenario, Harris has a much smaller lead in Pennsylvania than Biden did, that Clinton did.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If the same error occurs, not even that, just a two point miss, not a three point miss, that's still a Trump win.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"No, it's not, if you're Harris, you want to be up by two to three points on average, not up by point five, because you are one point away from losing Pennsylvania and more than likely losing the presidency.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I guess that's possible, but Harris is up by point five and that's with two big outliers.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Definitely Kamala Harris, i would say Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I mean you're someone who said that you support Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Is there anything you didn't hear tonight that you wanted to hear, eddie: well I wanted to hear as I said at the beginning I wanted to hear honest actual policy proposals and I wanted to hear the truth and I got some honest policy proposals but they all came from Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"All I heard from Donald Trump was more angry vilification of immigrants, more goofy conspiracy theories about nine-month abortions and eating your neighbor's cat and those aren't policy proposals and I really was looking for something like that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, that's right, despite what Democrats may claim about the current state of the race and how Harris is actually up by 50 points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, does that mean for sure Democrats will lose Pennsylvania: of course not Pennsylvania can absolutely go to Harris, but these numbers are so bad for Democrats that it makes you really wonder how likely is it that Harris could actually win Pennsylvania because it's not just one metric.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Oh, it's a Trump lead on the RCP average.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, trump is up in the RCP average by just under half a point despite Bloomberg, despite Quinnipiac, despite the New York Times posting bull shit.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're the only pollsters right now that have Harris winning Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And if it wasn't even for the Bloomberg poll, I mean Harris plus five, really: you're still finding Harris plus five.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yet right now, Trump's up by just under half a point, and that's with some big outliers.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're the only ones right now that found Trump losing Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, more than likely Trump is up in Pennsylvania right now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It they understated Trump by a lot until the very end, when by some miracle, the polls became very close.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But I find that so unlikely just for the simple fact it hasn't happened in Pennsylvania in 2020 or 2016, when Trump's on the ballot every year.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I just don't think you're going to see Harris Harris point miss.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's possible, but do you really think with pollsters like Bloomberg, Quinnipiac and the New York Times posting their shit that they're going to be right, when everyone else is showing Trump leads: it's possible, I guess.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Even though that sounds just absolutely crazy to suggest, that's what some Democrats are banking on, they're really banking on the idea that, well, these far right pollsters like Insider Advantage, Emerson, Trafalgar, they're going to understate Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that's why we're actually winning, and I know that sounds crazy, but some Democrats really believe that all the polls are going to understate Harris this time around.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If that really does happen, it's Harris not going to win Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yes, Politico, not Fox News, not Newsmax, politico, they outright admitted that the Harris operation in Pennsylvania is a complete shit show.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's what Politico is reporting, this is not good for Harris at all because if Republicans are now picking up steam and early voting and now this drops.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But like I said before, this doesn't mean that Harris will for sure win Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Is it by 80 points: no, but I would say it's clear as day that Trump is a favorite.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Remember, in 2016, Donald Trump clinched Pennsylvania by just 0.72%, but in 2020, the tables turned and Joe Biden reclaimed the state with a 1.17% margin.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Harris lost the poll by two points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Trump won the poll by two points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris leads the poll by three points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Again, Harris won the poll by two points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Ms. Harris is an active member of AKA, the oldest Greek letter organization established by African-American college-educated women, and has said the organization changed her life.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Since taking office as vice president, she's attended numerous Divine Nine engagements, including her own sororities boule on July 10.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This year is an exceptional year, but it does not differ from our efforts from years past, she said.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They were founded on political activism, she said.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Ms. Harris ties to the coalition might also prove to be a way to re energize black male voters, who Republicans have increasingly begun to view as an attainable slice of the electorate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"However, she said recent voting initiatives within the divine nine have further strengthened bonds between members, including men.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They grew up during Barack Obama's presidency, she said, they're excited for Kamala, but it's a different type of rationalization about why they're excited for her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Jabari Michael Kensu, a Kappa Alpha Psi alum chapter member and a pit graduate, echoed her sentiment.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He called Ms. Harris affiliation a point of pride, but not the primary reason young divine nine members have rallied behind her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He said it's because her policies, such as her plan to provide first time homebuyers with up to $25,000 to help with down payments will benefit them.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is winning Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is huge, seeing that the last two polls, three polls, et cetera, two polls were three, as you know, three point wins for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So what this is possibly saying is we're seeing Kamala Harris polls getting more skewed up.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"By this itself, this should be enough to take out the average and giving it to Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And ideally we could just say Donald Trump has taken the average right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You could say that some of these polls here have registered these two polls that showed Kamala Harris out of the margin of error for her victory.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But this is what we're going to go ahead and do, we're going to take a look at Pennsylvania and try to predict a Harris point five.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So this is what I'm thinking, obviously Donald Trump is going to gain some.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But ideally and realistically, more now it's a Harris point four.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"More of these said groups are going to move, so ideally you could say, oh yeah, Northampton County, there's a chance Northampton County does flip in favor for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We just said a side Kamala Harris point five said victory.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But what we're seeing right now is a Harris plus four would look like this.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But, yeah, let's dip it down more, that's a Harris point three.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, you'll see this is shaping up to be a Donald Trump victory.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This was would be my demographical prediction, trump plus point four point six.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Obviously, things are changing here, you're seeing more Trump polls coming in, which is obviously great.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So what would a the question is, I'm going to bring it up again.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What would a Harris point five victory look like: so let's see.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Obviously, let's bring it down, a little bit.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Connell Harris to win the state of Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And this looks like a Harris point.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"We'll do fifty five, and, this is a Harris point one Harris point five.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, even if I move this, it's still a Trump win.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"OK, now it's a Harris point eight.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is Harris point seven.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This should be Trump of Trump win right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But ideally we know real real clear politics is already having a Trump win.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump is back here in Butler, Pennsylvania for some unfinished business as his campaign has put it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's certainly a state that Vice President Kamala Harris covets the most and it's a location in which both candidates have spent an enormous amount of resources.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This place has certainly become an important symbolic location for Trump supporters around the country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"They have early vote this time and so there is definitely an effort to register voters here, get them to vote and support President Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know that, we heard Trump talk about many of the themes that he's touched on over the years.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The other day I saw her get up and say we will do this, we will do that, we're gonna, why didn't they do it four years ago, why didn't they do it: the damage is so bad and so it's been done.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump called on Elon Musk to join him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
At the time he had just had his debate with President Biden that had been very successful from the Trump campaign standpoint.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Harris campaign is heavily focused around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and the suburbs around those cities.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Irrefutable proof that what Donald Trump says is the truth.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Random people at his rallies screaming that they agree with him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This from the New Republic, Trump's hateful new rants at rally are harshly debunked by town leader.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's what the former president is saying, Manning told me.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And then there's easily observable reality, that's kind of always the case, though, isn't it: there's what Trump says, and then there's easily observable reality.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The borough manager isn't the only Pennsylvania official speaking out against Trump's attacks on the Haitian community in Charleroi.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She plans to meet with Trump on Monday during a visit to western Pennsylvania, where she said she will be happy to share with him to please, please come to Charleroi so we can show you these wonderful people because it's a different story everywhere.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"How'd that work out for you, Senator: this story was published before the rally that I played the clip from earlier took place, so if Bartolotta did get to meet with Trump before he gave that speech, she must not have been very convincing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Another local official, also a Republican, also infuriatingly still a Trump supporter, laid out the situation very succinctly.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Anyway, here's my challenge to all the Republicans â€” in Charleroi, in Washington County, Pennsylvania, in Springfield, Ohio, and everywhere else that has been threatened by the stochastic terrorism perpetrated by Donald Trump and J.D. Vance and the Republican Party in general, my challenge to all of them, to all of you â€” let's pretend and say they're watching me right now â€” to all of you, if you really want to help the Haitian immigrants in your towns, if you really want to stand up for them and show the world that they are welcome, that they are important members of your communities, don't just talk.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Publicly announce that you are going to vote for Kamala Harris, and encourage everyone else to do the same.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Because while I appreciate that you've been willing to speak out against the lies being spewed by Donald Trump, the fact that you're still voting for him makes your defense of your Haitian constituents ring pretty hollow.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"As Trump and Vance have demonstrated of late, words mean things.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And right now your message is, what Donald Trump says about our Haitian residents isn't true and isn't fair, but I'm still going to vote for him because he probably just needs to get to know us better.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then he'll stop saying these things.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Sure, and if Benjamin Netanyahu would just visit Gaza and meet the people there, he'd stop what he's doing right away.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Senator, I got to ask you what in the world was happening in Wilkes-Barre with that Donald Trump David McCormick speech: it was it was odd to say the least.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But when he then aligns himself with Donald Trump's extremism, not only is it valueless, but it then just gets weird.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But the volunteers, I mean, we've seen we've seen in Pennsylvania the number of volunteers increasing not by thousands, but by tens of thousands since since Kamala Harris announced her candidacy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I would hope that he would condemn this, but I haven't heard a word about condemnation.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That statement by the former president, that one and the one preceding it, should be categorically condemned.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will win at the national level.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Saying that he didn't need celebrities to pack his rallies.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He also said a lot of other things that you would expect.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He did reflect on the assassination attempt itself.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he spent a lot of time honoring the 50 year old former fire chief that died, Corey Comperatorre.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And my apologies if I've said his name incorrectly.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"From there, he launched into more of his traditional talking points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he's also a young Democrat who has ambitions of his own to run for president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So it wouldn't be unusual for him to take this next step.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, he also has some baggage with him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's starting off in Philadelphia and reportedly she will have her running mate with her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania is probably it's the state that Kamala Harris can't afford to lose.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris has to carry all of those if she wants to win the election.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So technically, President Trump could afford to lose Pennsylvania, not that he wants to, obviously, but he could and he could still win the election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And given the assassination attempt, sort of the the entire the strengthening of Trump's base and sort of the invigoration into the campaign ever since that attempt, I think that that's something that I said has become very symbolic for the Republican Party.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If you will recall, Donald Trump won all the electoral votes in Pennsylvania in the 2016 US presidential elections by a margin of 0.72%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It shuts off so many of Trump's paths to victory.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he loses Pennsylvania, he basically has to win Pennsylvania in order to come up with the victory here.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Otherwise he's got to pick off some really hard to reach states.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris receives 51% among the likely voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's important, people who are polled and say they likely will show up and vote Trump at 45%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Again that magic 45 number for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And it is a massive, massive swing for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"As of right now, I'm going to go through the details that we have of the event of President Donald Trump being shot.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And again, he's okay.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"As of right now, it looks like Trump is okay.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Secret Service was able to grab him and cover him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And then as soon as they felt that it was clear, they were able to get him and move him to a van.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He had blood all over his face.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he did a fist pump to let the people know that he was going to be okay.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Frantic scene took hold as shots rang out, sending Trump supporters streaming from the stands and away from the event.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump hears a shot and he looks and then all of a sudden he grabs his ear and he falls to the ground and the Secret Service rushed in.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He then, after being taken to the ground, stood up, pumped his fists, says, USA, Make America Great Again.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is crazy, let's see here, okay, Secret Service encircled Trump within seconds of the shots being fired and the agency statement is that the former president is safe.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Rosemary Atardo says, my thoughts exactly, President Trump will not stop fighting for the people of this country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Shots fired at the Trump rally.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If you're just joining us, former President Donald Trump has been shot.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Apologies, i'm just getting this just as soon as you guys are Trump shooter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let's let's look at this together, okay, Trump shooter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"They got the guy, Trump footage shooter being dragged out.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is in Butler, Pennsylvania with 50,000 supporters at the Trump rally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The last time this happened was President Ronald Reagan, who many have compared Donald Trump to.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let's all pray for the Trump family, and I will be back on later with more updates.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"US What's up YouTube this is 2raw4TV, alright, so according to reports, top Democratic officials in Pennsylvania are concerned that Kamala Harris is losing ground in the state of Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But anyway, they're concerned that Kamala is not having an effect, her campaign does not have an effective strategy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I'm not even sure if she's going to lose Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I don't think that it's a lie to say that over the past two weeks, if she had a lead, she's squandering it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But remember, eight years ago, the left-wing media didn't have any problems pushing Evan McMullen, who was a right-wing third party candidate who hurt Trump, even though Trump still won.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now they're pushing this misinformation campaign that Jill Stein is a Trump agent, and Jill Stein is only running the hurt camel.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think he's going to get about 14%.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he gets over 15% of black votes, she's done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm hearing reports about Trump signs scattered all across Philly, especially South Philly.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I can't, I don't, you know, look, man, I don't buy this about that many black people voting Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If Trump gets anything like close, remotely close to 20% of black vote, she is toast, but we'll see.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So it looked, if it turns out that it's less than 90% of black women voted for Kamala, then you know, it's real.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
President Biden and former President Trump won their respective primaries in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But the thing about these places is they're also the kinds of voters where Donald Trump would hope to cut into some of those margins.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Brian Fitzpatrick, it's notable, the Republican from Bucks County, won his primary against a conservative challenger.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Are you seeing across the country some of the Republicans who are supportive of abortion rights being a little bit wary of Trump who nominated people to the Supreme Court who overturned Roe v. Wade: yeah, I think that's going to be a central question of this election because we've seen across the country since the overturning of Roe every time an abortion measure was on the ballot it has passed.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I think more than anything else, if he's elected this time, there it's going to be staffed with loyalists from the start.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Do they turn out for Biden, do they stay home, do they convert to Trump: i don't anticipate that a lot of them do, but it also depends on, you know, there are a lot of factors, obviously.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You mentioned the Trump trials.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I think what's interesting is how Biden is going to message this because we've all said for the better part of a decade now, and we've said, you know, this could be the thing that finally turned suburban voters against Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If I'm Democrats, the one thing they have an advantage on for issues and the one new thing that's been happened since Trump left office, abortion, you got to press that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yet now, with Harris headlining the Democratic ticket, we have seen those gains diminish quite a bit.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And here on our map, it gets marked down as Safe Democrat adding 10 more electoral votes to the Harris tally.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The latest survey here though, again from Qantas Polls and News, between August 14th and 15th, is Harris leading by 2 points, 46.2% to 44.6%, among 601 registered voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now what will happen is throughout the whole night on election night every single one of these counties will be all of them through all state they will be reporting in their election counts from all of the polling stations and all of these counties over here will be the first to report in and so as you're watching whatever station they'll be showing that Pennsylvania is red red red red red and everybody will start freaking out and that's because so many of these counties are reporting in and they're all reporting in huge numbers for Donald Trump but here's what you have to understand about Pennsylvania is that the total vote count in Pennsylvania in 2020 was about 6.9 million total votes cast and 43.2 percent of them came from this county and these counties right here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now these counties here will report in earlier than Philadelphia because there are fewer people here than there are in Philadelphia and the thing to note is of all of these votes here in Allegheny in 2020 almost 65% of them went for Biden in this whole section here including Philadelphia it was about 66% of all the votes from this area went for Biden but in Philadelphia which is included in this number of the 66% but if you take this out and just look at Philadelphia 80% of the votes coming out of Philadelphia went to Biden and so when you look at 43% of all of the votes cast in Pennsylvania are coming from these two areas and that roughly 65% of all of those votes went to Biden it means that the state goes to the Democrat it's just the way that the numbers work out especially if there is a significant increase in the number of people voting in this area especially in Philadelphia and also over here in Allegheny which we expect to have happened in this election so come November when you're watching the election returns you are going to relax take a deep breath get out your popcorn and whatever adult beverages you might be consuming that night and you will just sit and watch the returns coming in from Pennsylvania and you will not care what is happening for the whole state of Pennsylvania until the Philadelphia metropolitan area starts reporting in and Allegheny County because between those two areas that is 40 it's going to be 43% of the vote and in fact I would say with the increase in voter participation for this particular election it could be anywhere from 45 46 48 percent of the entire vote coming out of those two areas and because the majority of the voters are voting for the Democrat this is why I predict Kamala Harris is taking Pennsylvania in this election it's just about the math,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If Vice President Harris wins Pennsylvania, she likely is president.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I've always been saying that when Trump is on the ballot, it's gonna be very, very close.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You've campaigned across Pennsylvania and you've gone to places like Somerset County where Donald Trump won by 56 points four years ago.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's definitely gonna win big there again, but with relatively few votes there, what's the big idea behind the strategy of trying to cut into his margin in places like Somerset instead of trying to drive up turnout in more populous places where we know Democrats will do well: yeah, well, there's some history to this.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump carried that county by about 2000 votes.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Why is this spot, which is just off Interstate 79, north of you, why is it so fickle, why are they the way they are: well, it's not that they're fickle, because I think at 2016, Donald Trump really made his case to Erie more more and more successfully than Secretary Clinton may have done that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Certainly a strong message there and Tim Walz as we know was on ABC's The View Today and Selina it seemed that perhaps he was a little more prepared to answer the question of how a Harris-Walls administration might differ from the current Biden-Harris administration what are we hearing from him: yeah it was really interesting because Governor Walz gave a more concrete answer to this question about how Harris would be different from a Biden administration than Harris herself ever has he specifically said that she is going to be more focused on the care economy and child care stuff that has not been as much of the focus for the Biden administration take a listen to what else he said here.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I also asked the press secretary about Trump vowing to name Elon Musk the head of a new government efficiency commission at a time when some experts have been raising concerns that this could be a conflict of interest because Elon Musk's companies have a lot of government contracts with these government agencies and that role could actually give them the power to regulate those very agencies that hold sway over his companies.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump has taken the lead out of the state of Pennsylvania in the real clear politics polling average.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's not enough to get to 70, he needs a rust belt state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We've had a few polls over the past week that have had Donald Trump leading.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We've got the Trump iconic design.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The make cat safe again design, the Trump mugshot design, the make America gain again design great for the gym, by the way, also we have the America first design the Rep logo design all of our original designs plus the new designs.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You can get it for 1995 the iconic Trump design on the front the inspirational quote on the back and for a limited time you could buy one get one 20% off all t-shirts tank tops and mugs.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But Pennsylvania Kamala Harris, she's got a problem.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There's a lot, we just don't know but Pennsylvania is a crucial state for Donald Trump and he never led in Pennsylvania back in 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And my question to people is why do they believe that Donald Trump is incapable of making up 1% ground when he's going up against a candidate that is not all that good of a fit for Pennsylvania: pennsylvania knew Joe Biden and they knew the old Joe Biden and they were comfortable with the older Joe Biden.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is somebody who says I don't want to take this issue to the national level.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris is not really able to stop the bleeding.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"When you look at this, he could very well flip a county like Lackawanna County, which is where Scranton is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think you will see Donald Trump gain.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think you will see him gain a little bit.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I think he's going to gain with Hispanic significantly, especially among Puerto Ricans in the Philadelphia area, Philadelphia City proper in particular.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because Donald Trump, John Federman is right.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But it's possible Donald Trump could win Bucks.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He doesn't have to win it to win the state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But if he does win it, it's going to be very difficult to see him losing the state of Pennsylvania when it's all said and done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, Donald Trump was just endorsed by President Duda of Poland.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's their leader.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris doesn't exactly have that point of strength.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's true, they say there's no reason to believe she can approach the numbers Biden was able to get.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that takes into account the past four years of Biden's record, which she's basically tied to with the hip.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Even if she wants to distance herself, she's not going to be able to do so effectively.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But just also her record, you know, she isn't like this Catholic larper like Biden was who would never let people forget about it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is not capturing these people and they will determine the outcome of the state and they will determine potentially the outcome of a couple of these House races and possibly the Senate race as well.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Northeastern Pennsylvania, Harris's prospects are dicier.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's not going to be able to gain, you know, five, ten points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, she will lose ground.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But Kamala Harris, you're probably not going to see it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump also put a Catholic from the Rust Belt on his ticket as well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Kamala Harris has this problem in the state of Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She'll do well in certain suburbs of Philadelphia.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But everywhere else is a very good chance she'll bleed support on net.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And in a state that was super close in 2020, and you're not seeing this male in the Philadelphia area at the same rate you saw last time, she's in an uphill climb in the state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And I believe that she could very well lose the state by two to three points when it's all said and done, depending on how things go over the next 35 days.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And hold on to the end, because I'm going to explain why I think the wheels are starting to fall off the Kamala Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But we're going to get to that, donald Trump has been winning men by just about upper single digits every single time, 51 to 44 here down slightly among women by four points, roughly tied with 18 to 39 year olds.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's roughly tied among middle age voters, but maybe there's some regional up and downs and whatever.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Trump is winning big among older voters here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm happy to see that come together because he's been down and it doesn't make sense to me.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Trump is winning the white vote by five points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump's taking home 25 percent of the black vote.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But he's winning Hispanic 62 percent to 36 percent.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's a fake issue because Donald Trump is not taking our democracy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's literally running for president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris wins 90 percent to 9 percent among MSNBC viewers.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump only wins 80 percent to 18 percent among Fox News viewers.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here's the thing, if MSNBC reported more like CNN, and this is not an endorsement of the fairness of CNN, although I will tell you I do not over and over again see CNN hosts banging away at Trump's dictator with spittle flying from their mouths the same way I do on MSNBC.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think that's because there's still a whole cadre of left leaning pollsters that progressively moved Harris up week after week.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But you know, Emerson's Harris plus one Quinnipiac is tied.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"CNN's Harris plus one New York Times, she has tied.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think you're going to see probably Atlas Intel drop another poll and Trafalgar and they're all going to show broadly the same kind of thing as me.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And the numbers that show Harris left or New York Post's using somebody that I'm not sure I think is kind of questionable.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And if Biden and Biden won by four, but he was up eight four years ago, ergo, the polling was left by about four points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris, again, Kamala Harris is up to now when Hillary Clinton was really up four point five.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is doing two points at least worse than Hillary Clinton was eight years ago.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think he's going to do better than that.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So that is a safe Trump win.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The real clear politics aggregate for Pennsylvania is exactly tied right now, even with Bloomberg Morning Consult throwing in a Harris plus five that's way out in left field.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I think my polling that we put out the Trump tied in Pennsylvania is to left because of the sample and the internal demographics.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think Trump is winning Pennsylvania right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's ridiculous, so Trump is doing five to seven points better than he was doing in Pennsylvania polling four years ago.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump won this state by almost a point.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think you're going to see a massive Trump outperformance here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump 49, Trump 50, all of a sudden after the debate, though, there's been a ton of Trump buying pressure and Trump is now up to 52% in Pennsylvania and the Democrats.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that puts him up four points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
If polly market shows Kamala Harris is losing.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
If the polling on real clear politics shows Kamala Harris is losing.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Last week, black Republicans visited deep blue Baltimore City on a so-called more money with Trump bus tour, while attendance was low, confidence was not.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So we are running like I.E. phones for Harris and Wallace because originally we weren't going to do anything when Biden was going to be this presidential candidate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, and you see Harris at 49 percent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So those Republicans that don't love Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But I thought the vice president did a great job, both laying out her vision and also prosecuting the case against Donald Trump, showing the clear contrast, particularly on the issue of abortion and the fundamental freedom for women to be able to make decisions over their own bodies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Governor as a prosecutor yourself, the former attorney general, how would you describe the strategy that the vice president employed when asked a question: she would answer it, but then she would quickly pivot and almost bait Donald Trump into speaking about another issue.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so when you entice him that way to talk about himself, instead of talking about the American people and how he's going to help them, it's something that we've come to know is just part of his problem.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's focused on himself.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's not focused on the future of trying to help the American people.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He said, would the war be over if you were president of the United States: he couldn't answer that question.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Kamal responded by saying, well, yeah, it would be over because Donald Trump would just give up.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"How did you rate those different questions on foreign policy: i thought she hit herself really well on foreign policy and all Donald Trump did was say, well, it would have never happened this way and never would have happened that way and offered absolutely no concrete evidence for that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Kamala Harris made clear that she's going to be an all of the above energy president.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I have confidence that she'll continue that.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Today, Kamala Harris leads by one.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump, however, has lost roughly half a point since that initial dropout.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that is substantial, that is a position where Donald Trump was initially slated to do quite well.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The lead was pretty substantial, that he had room to fall, but that room and that gap had been narrowing and narrowing and narrowing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And now Kamala Harris is losing on the nuclear politics average by just 0.2% nationwide.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We know we talked about the Cook Political Report data point yesterday that showed Kamala Harris with an advantage.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
New York Times had Kamala Harris up four points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So the 46 to 43 lead here is also very much in line with what we see on Quinnipiac of a 48 versus 45 point lead and then a 50 to 46 lead for Kamala Harris in the New York Times poll.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That is really good news for Kamala Harris and also just goes to show that these are pollsters that come from very different backgrounds, very different funding sources, very different methodologies in understanding the Pennsylvania electorate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that is substantial because Kamala Harris being ahead in Pennsylvania goes to show that her level of electability really boils down to the Sunbelt and the Rust Belt, the exact two regions that Kamala Harris was needed the most.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that is the problem for Donald Trump, because it would be one thing at the New York Times in a college poll was a fluke and he tried to write it off as such.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Fox News poll, for instance, that showed Donald Trump with a one point advantage that is very clearly an outlier based on what we're working with nationally, but still he uplifts it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But beyond that point, there wasn't much else that Donald Trump could really uplift.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And we know that he has a long history of attacking pollsters when he disagrees with the results.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And then came another point where flank Franklin and Marshall College, which again is the in state in house pollster in Pennsylvania, one of the best pollsters in the state, showing Kamala Harris with a three point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It is these metrics that show consistency and a lead for Kamala Harris and something that should terrify Republicans.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is ahead by 2.3 percent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That based on their numbers with Joe Biden is a six point swing, 4.5 percent to 2.3 nearly seven point swing from where Biden was against Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They said she's a communist.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's from California.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yada, yada, yada, they went through the San Francisco trope, the many different tropes, leaning into attacking her own racial identity basis.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I still think it will be under five points no matter who wins the election, even if Kamala Harris has a quote unquote massive victory nationwide because Pennsylvania is born to be about a ground state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris was losing and Pennsylvania a week ago also had Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A massive, massive change, and as I said, with Pennsylvania goes Michigan, 65 percent chance for Kamala Harris victory.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Wisconsin, 60 percent chance for Kamala Harris victory, this is where you see Pennsylvania and the Rust Belt states move in unison in favor of Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And I cannot also ignore the fact that Tim Walz being added onto the ticket has done phenomenally, found a phenomenal thanks for Kamala Harris's campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so very, very different circumstances, and because he hails from the Rust Belt and because he adds that level of electability, he adds to the Kamala Harris ticket.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She, you know, Biden won it by two point eight.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Those 19 electoral votes, if they go to Trump, he wins the election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If that happens, Donald Trump genuinely could win the election on Pennsylvania alone.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And it is really hard to see, now that Kamala Harris is building out this advantage and expanding her lead.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, we see that on the five thirty eight numbers here, she's ahead by two point eight percent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If Pennsylvania becomes a three four point state for Kamala Harris, she's winning Georgia.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's changing the perception.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is winning Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Voters said they trusted him, trusted Trump on taxes, on housing, on all these issues.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You're starting to see voters warm up to her on her economic vision.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, so when we consider the contrasting economic visions here and frankly where the candidates have been, Harris made that comment on childcare in Philadelphia with the NABJ, one of the swing states, one of the key states we're talking about here.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump, meantime, is going to Long Island this evening to talk about the salt cap, something that according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, actually 92% of the benefits of that go to the top 10% of earners in states like New York and California, not these states that we're talking about, Laura.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris is up double digits in that state, although we should point out here, he is the one that put the salt cap into place in the first place in 27.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"As recently as 2019, Trump had said, oh, well, maybe we'll reverse that, realizing that the politics around this had been quite heightened.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Democrats and Harris are still saying, look, we're going to pay for some of this new spending with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, but not doing a lot to bring down overall spending.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Stahl makes the case and I believe he's right that were it not for Trump's endorsement of Oz, McCormick would have won the primary.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The flip side of it is how humiliating is it that Trump lost to a guy who didn't leave his basement: right.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like if if anyone concedes that that's what Biden did, it makes it all the more embarrassing that Trump lost to that guy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, of course, they say he didn't really lose.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's record is a disaster.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Trump announcement next Tuesday will be on those platforms.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Many of them don't want to vote Trump for whatever the reason may be.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I don't know what the reason is, but a lot of them don't want to vote Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, a lot of them don't want to vote Kamala either.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They don't like her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They think she is too extreme.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now this is of no surprise because I've been following Kamala and her national political aspirations for a while.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She was not popular, people didn't like her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Nobody liked her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She was polling, so poorly she was behind Pete, booty gig, Amy Klobuchar, all these randos on a democratic side.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She pulled behind, but now all of a sudden everybody likes her and she's bringing new energy into the party.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Pacey supported Nikki Haley but won't vote for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Ever, and he sees Kamala Harris as more liberal than he would like.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So who are you going to vote for: oh, I'm not excited about voting for Kamala Harris, but it's better than the alternative.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You're going to vote, you call yourself a Reagan Republican and you vote for Kamala Harris, who is the exact opposite of all things conservative.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There would have been no way, you think Harris can win Pennsylvania: i think she can.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Let's pause here for a second, now, Kamala may have had a better chance at winning Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She worries about Trump's course tone and what she sees as angry populism.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Sabatini is also never Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I watch his campaign rallies.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Because I don't want to see Trump elected after the chaos of the prior four years.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Sabatini, the chaos of what: these like the biting years, i don't understand the Trump years was chaos.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, he says she's read things that worry her about Harris, about immigration policy and about being tough on her staff.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's angry that Trump constantly attacks courts and judges and election results.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When Biden was on the ticket, I was going to vote for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But now it's, it's a harder call just because I am not a fan of Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The same people will be behind the scenes running the country because Kamala is incompetent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala don't know, kamala is a general idiot, like worse than the normie mouth breather.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They're cheering on because he's Taking it to custody.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's not a threat no more.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I don't You know people make everything about Trump supporters seem horrible and bad.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's definitely crazy You know to have people that wants to you know attack Trump and I'm gonna say this attack anybody No, you you literally I don't know what as far as like how far they going like, what are you charged with: i'm pretty sure something bad.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They is more And it's people that saying that they don't think that Trump is gonna win You literally have a whole bunch of people coming to these rallies supporting Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You don't have you know people that You don't need you don't need the buses you don't need to pay people to come to see Trump you don't need that You know, I mean you don't need none of that You literally have people that really comes to support Trump and listen what he has to say That's what you have you literally have that All these people That's lit red hats I Love it That's you need you need you need that kind of support this just goes to show you like real support though This is real support.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Y'all see I did a video yesterday about how they needed a Kamala needed a homeless people Homeless people to support her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, it's not a secret we've been going through a lot as a country and Yeah, Biden always promised promise a lot of politicians always promised through the years, but All of us know the world knows Everybody's experienced it the best president the world's I've seen this country that has ever seen his name is President Trump Now you can tell that he nervous that's what I like seeing though It's it's so many people that it's all crazy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So all my Puerto Ricans, let's stay United Let's vote for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Y'all see it definitely prayers to Trump always, you know prayers to Trump What are you going through, it's an I'm pretty sure didn't he if I'm not mistaken What did Trump what did they: trump Cuz I'm pretty sure Didn't somebody try to So why didn't you get shot in Pennsylvania if I'm not mistaken Yeah, I Feel like that speaks a lot though, bro.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What do you make of this: oh, it's a terrible, terrible thing that she did and a huge mistake.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If I were advising Kamala Harris on her campaign, I would have said, OK, let's just pretend this never happened.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, i'm talking about if I were trying to advise her and let's go talk about abortion more.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And now I'm on Kamala's team.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If anything, all it does is strengthen Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Trump was Trump shows up.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yes, and the fact that Trump shows up just it's he's leading by example on on every single front and he's showing up when he knows it's going to be emotionally taxing and difficult.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala has just been there, clay had a statistician on last week who was saying that basically so go with Pennsylvania, so go with the race.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They're going to help get him across the goal line.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But they they have a lot of synergy at the top of the ticket where Trump appeals to that working class, middle class union Democrat.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, without Pennsylvania, I don't see how Kamala has a path at all.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I am going to be and you may well be there to Sean, because I know you spoke and did so fabulously well at one of the most recent Trump rallies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There are some Democrats being very vocal, others speaking on background, but they're worried about Harris's momentum.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Their concern voters still don't see how she's different than President Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I would much rather have our team on the floor for the final two minutes of the game standing with Kamala Harris and Tim balls.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A record record amount of votes, what is the Harris coalition look like, how does she ensure that she wins Pennsylvania: well, just two things.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's showing up, she's answering questions.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think she's doing what she needs to do.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I joked with her the other day when I saw her Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Something like four and a half out of the seven days that week she's returning.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Our oldest is our daughter, our daughter Sophia was born into this world with more rights than she has today simply because Donald Trump was president of the United States.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He bragged about how he ripped away the freedom for women to just simply be able to make decisions over their own bodies to start a family on their own timeline and their own terms to have a full range of medical care across this country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We have seen Elon Musk become the right to defeat the Trump surrogate.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But why do you think that message is read is resonating with so many Pennsylvania voters and how do you push back against that if you're Harrison and in your role as a surrogate for her: well, look, I think if you look at the people lining up to be surrogates for Kamala Harris, it's far more plentiful.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Far more numbers out there to support Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You've got Democrats, business leaders, military leaders, former Republicans were able to fill rooms even if Kamala Harris is not there in Pennsylvania to let people know what is at stake and why they should rally around Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Do you think that's something that can be effective: he certainly has endless resources, but understand Kamala Harris is a very important person.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She has plenty of resources to be able to communicate her message.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I'm just trying to make the point that there are a whole lot of folks on the side of Harrison walls who have the ability to go out and bring different people into the conversation and be out there stumping for her when she's not able to be there.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I do want to say because I know she's listening backstage, thank you Madam Vice President for your leadership both domestic and abroad and for your persistent and enduring advocacy for underserved communities all across the country.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It is my humble pleasure to introduce our amazing Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This could be a great sign when it comes to Donald Trump possibly winning the state of Pennsylvania, the most important state of the 2024 election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So that's why it's down by more, but this is still pretty crazy when you look at the difference and you would say that would at least help Trump by you would have to say 20, maybe 30,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And also on top of that with the voter registration with all the recent polls where Trump's outperforming his numbers in 2020 and 2016 and he won in 2016 and he barely lost in 2020, Pennsylvania is looking really good that you can see the data with Biden winning the state by 81 K. This is huge news for Trump's election chances because it means democratic mail and enthusiasm is falling off and not just by more than Republicans and raw numbers, but at twice the rate 2020 was a pandemic year.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, in-person is always going to favor Trump, so anytime you can see a decrease of around 15%, it is good.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We would expect Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to go to Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's, it's really tight, but you can make an argument either Pennsylvania or Wisconsin could be, you know, in terms of which one's easier for Trump to win.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And it's not just like, oh, he's down by one.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's down by two weeks down by one.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Alexa, why should I vote for Kamala Harris: while there are many reasons to vote for Kamala Harris, the most significant may be that she has a strong candidate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's a strong candidate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Like that's the number one, you know, most generic thing you can say about someone if you're trying to make people vote for them, she's a strong candidate with a great track record.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, she's got a great track record.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She, she, I mean, she did win zero votes.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They installed her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"No, no, no, she does have a good track record.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"No, no, no, you're right, she has a good track record.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Vice president Harris has already broken down a major gender barrier and her career.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump left office with net loss of 3 million jobs, with a 6.3% unemployment rate, with an economic contraction of 3.4%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is so bad that if Donald Trump would have taken Democrats' advice, and I'm sure most of us realize that he's using the whole COVID thing as a way to say Donald Trump's a terrible president because when he left office, of course COVID was raging and you had all his, his economy got destroyed because of it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But if Donald Trump would have listened to Democrats, the unemployment would have been worse because remember their number one criticism of Donald Trump was that he was letting people die by opening up the government and the economy too soon because he only shut it down for a month.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So their original criticism was that he didn't keep everything shut down.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, if Donald Trump would have listened to Democrats, they would have lost triple quadruple the amount of jobs.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All of it, donald Trump left office.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If it were up to liberals, their argument was that Donald Trump didn't lose more jobs because they wanted everything shut down for months on end.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And they said Donald Trump was killing people when he opened up everything and allowed people to go back to work and allow it small businesses to operate again.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Their argument now is that Donald Trump lost all of these jobs.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And it's all total gaslighting because originally Trump opened up everything too soon.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He allowed people to go back to work too soon.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he was this big horrible person who killed, I mean, they said he killed millions.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When you break it down, their entire argument originally was that Donald Trump should have lost more jobs and we should have had higher unemployment.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Do you understand why that is: because they said that Donald Trump opened things up too quickly and he killed people because of it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now they're arguing that, that Donald Trump, I guess kept everything closed and had the unemployment.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is just a perfect example, i think he said something about the economy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump left office at the heart of COVID.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm presuming it was taken after the debate.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We're talking, this is about the Georgia election interference case What can you tell us about that, yeah, that case has been embroiled in a lot of controversy with district attorney Fonnie Willis And questions about whether she will even remain on the case as she had a relationship alleged relationship with the prosecutor on the case as well So a few charges dropped on that Trump not commenting on it at this moment He did not mention it yesterday at all, but he does talk often about how his court cases are Quote rigged against him and he believes he will defeat them all so allies I spoke to yesterday on the Trump campaign just kind of shrugged it off and said look it's just part of Kind of what we've been dealing with with these court cases They said that they are confident that Trump will beat all of them and you know We'll be looking to see if any of these court cases really come to fruition and come on the docket before November time is really ticking out especially for Jack Smith in Washington DC, right: it certainly doesn't seem as though any of them will Olivia Rinaldi.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
How do you pronounce F-A-N-I Fani: donald Trump was speaking at an NRA event on Friday night.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump gets lost telling a story about marble columns.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here, Donald Trump brags about how he did nothing on guns at all.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when he was presented even with bipartisan legislation to try to stop the proliferation of guns, he did nothing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he wants to brag about that, play this clip.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's not even believable, well, here, Donald Trump says that if President Biden wins the election, that one of the things that's going to happen is that the name of Pennsylvania will be changed.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's what Donald Trump wants to spread that unhinged conspiracy that the whole name Pennsylvania will be changed.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here, Donald Trump believes he's speaking on Saturday afternoon.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Next, Donald Trump talks about the federal criminal cases where he's a criminal defendant.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But he says even though he hid classified documents that he stole, asserted every invalid, improper privilege that exists.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He said that he cooperated more than President Biden's cooperation where President Biden gave full cooperation and for doing that, President Biden was then met with a Republican special counsel who violated every single Department of Justice rule and then tried to defame him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But here Donald Trump is saying he cooperated more.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I cooperated far more than Biden did who sent records to Chinatown and hear Trump brags that he gave the Department of Justice and FBI officials lunch.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He says I gave him lunch.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Next up, Donald Trump tells the same exact story he told over a year ago where he claims that he watched somebody shoplift and carry a refrigerator.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's got this massive.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I said, he's a pretty strong guy, right: can you believe and the end one year ago, Trump told that same story, but he's acting now like it happened again.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Here's what he said a year ago.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here, Donald Trump talks about dino dollars, whatever that means.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Play the clip, because he understood tariffs, I charged him massive hundreds of millions of din- dollars China paid to the United States.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump tells some story about rich people and subsidies, but he's slurring his entire way through this speech.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here, Donald Trump brags about, again, another unhinged lie.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He claims that he built the entire military.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He built it all.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, that's malignant narcissism right there, and of course, this follows the day before where Donald Trump said that January 6th was an insurrection caused by Nancy Pelosi.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump said he says Nancy Pelosi caused the insurrection.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This was after Donald Trump's lawyer argued during oral argument that January 6th was not an insurrection, but that it was a vile and shameful and violent crime that took place.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then Trump undercut his lawyer because his lawyer that would also be incriminating him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Trump says it's a Nancy Pelosi insurrection here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So Republicans have to decide who do they serve Donald Trump with American people.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"No, and I know that the media wants to gaslight us and the media wants to have all of these narratives and and also hoist up fascism and try to normalize Donald Trump's behavior.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But look, I think people are getting it when you actually speak with voters, especially independent voters and most Americans of about 42 43% of Americans identify as independent voters and they see Donald Trump talking about killing the border bill.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They hear Donald Trump about killing common sense legislation to address the proliferations of guns.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They see Donald Trump brag about Vladimir Putin.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The other guy's a joke, trump is a joke.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
If we look at those clips that I just showed you and say that person should be nowhere near the nuclear codes should be nowhere near a position of power that Donald Trump is someone who should be absolutely disqualified for being anywhere near any position of power because of his own behavior.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because of his statements and his conduct, if we believe that this is a place where we can all kind of come together.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Welcome back, as we mentioned earlier, former President Trump is heading to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania tonight for his first rally in that state since his assassination attempt this month in Butler.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We first met the duo, both of Dominican descent, before former President Trump survived an assassination attempt and pig JD Vance as his running mate.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Harris rose to the top of the ticket.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Both voters remain firmly undecided, but newly energized, she has direction and I think it evens a playing field for the two candidates.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Biden's endorsement of Harris only pushing her further away.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She now volunteers at the recently opened Trump campaign office.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Reading restaurant owner Cesar Lopez also recalls Harris's trip but hasn't been swayed yet.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Hey everybody, I am your host Alad reporting here in Pennsylvania outside of this Trump rally Let's go talk some of his support to see what's going on.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We're out here today in Pennsylvania head of this Trump rally Can you tell me a little bit more about why you guys decided to come out, we're tired of the perpetual war I'm more legal immigrants Tired tired of the immigrants tired of those prices, but I need them then don't go down now You guys are younger gentlemen, is that the biggest issue that you guys are facing guys kind of Gen Z voters here: no, not really I pay for my own gas.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They edit things He's been he's been his campaign's been working hard to do outreach to the black community Have you seen any of that stuff and do you think it's effective at all: yeah a little bit There's a lot of black voters a lot of black people going for Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I Like his policy with the border and that's my favorite I think we should need to deport all of the illegal immigrants and I think that we need to take our country back Absolutely.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I believe that Biden and Kamala have destroyed the government and I think that's enough for us to win and turn the state red again Absolutely.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I know originally it was Joe Biden who was the Democrats pick But then they swapped out Kamala Harris after a bad debate performance by Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She has no policies and she's full of word salad If Kamala Harris were elected president, she'd be the first female president You're obviously a woman would send mean anything to you the final so-called glass ceiling.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The Democrats big pitch has been nowadays about women's rights so-called women's rights and abortion access What do you make of that pitch to woman, is that an important issue, yeah, I believe that Trump has turned it over to the states for the states to regulate it And I believe that was the best decision to make Were you happy to see Roe v. Wade be overturned on the heels of Trump's Supreme Court appointees: i was happy that it was handed over to the seats.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Absolutely, trump did pick JD Vance for his VP pick What do you think of JD: i love JD.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He defends Trump and his own policies very well, and he doesn't take any bullshit from them at all Interesting story behind JD a few years ago.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He was actually a never Trump her, but I guess now has seen the light What do you make of that transformation the evolution of JD Vance: i think just like every other American he's seen the devastation and the Destruction of our country over the last four years and he knows that Trump's the only person that's going to get it done In a recent New York Times interview JD asked was asked if in 2020 he would have voted to certify the election He said no.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I don't I believe the election was stolen So we're out here today in Pennsylvania ahead of this Trump rally.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Absolutely, they're supporting you said you like his values.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's why We are supporting him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Absolutely, i want to ask you a little bit about Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I'm here to support my mother She's a huge Trump fan and I just thought I should be there to support her.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's not right, it's un-american to do it like that One of the main major pitches from the Democrats about Kamala Harris is that she's a woman She'd break the last so-called glass ceiling.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
What would you fear most about a Kamala Harris administration: her ineptitude and her Incompetence and her Her war on the Second Amendment.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's why I love Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Absolutely I want to ask Democrats this election around have been focusing on how Donald Trump is it allegedly a threat to democracy, have you heard this stuff and what do you make of that attack by Democrats: i think he was already the president for four years.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So if he was a threat to democracy, it would have happened already What do you make of Democrats who say you know: between that and January 6th this stuff disqualifies him from being president I just think that's bs personally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I don't think he had anything to do with it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Absolutely Kamala Harris if elected she would be the first female vice president this so-called last glass ceiling Does that matter to you at all that she's a woman: no, I have two sisters and a mom.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I love women Just not her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's not the one Absolutely Democrats other picture around has really been about so-called women's rights when it comes to abortion What do you think of that being the main pitch by Democrats this election cycle: i don't know.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So the fact that somebody said even recently like I guess Kamala changed her opinion about fracking, like if you said that years ago that you're gonna shut down fracking and you're not gonna allow fracking, well I believe as Americans we should honor each other's work.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Moments after shots have rung out at a rally where President Trump was addressing the crowd.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Several shots were heard, president Trump hit the stage.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We saw the Secret Service rush the podium when the noises began, move President Trump, former President Trump off the stage, and when he emerged he appeared to have some blood somewhere near one of his ears.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's the scene in Butler County, Pennsylvania where there was to be a marathon rally of former President Trump that only got five minutes in before this incident occurred.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Manufacturers have said that too and Donald Trump is saying, whoa, not so fast.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I say was because earlier this summer he decided to write an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer endorsing Kamala Harris as a local GOP leader.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now to put this straight he has not been a supporter of Donald Trump for some time.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Tomorrow we're going to wake up we're going to go to Butler Pennsylvania get a little different view of Trump in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So we're going to meet him and talk to him about why he you know supports Donald Trump and what he thinks about today's politics.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, I am not saying it's a foregone conclusion Trump's gonna win Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because if Trump wins Pennsylvania, well, at that point, he just needs Georgia, and he's at 270.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's all she needs at that point.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And at that point, if he just wins even Nevada, he's got the presidency.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But the other pollsters like Emerson, which I know they released a national poll just a day ago, where they had Trump down by a point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, now they released a poll out of Pennsylvania that has Trump up by a point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And not just that, but with the leaners, he's at 51%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So he's up by two points, according to Emerson.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Clinton plus nine, and we all know Trump won Pennsylvania by under a point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The fact that Trump's tied according to RCP, and that's what two horrendous polls, I mean, Quinnipiac, we all know their garbage.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now they have it, Harris plus four.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He is currently winning Pennsylvania by a couple points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Off by 12, that is garbage, the fact that Quinnipiac now has Harris only up by three.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, you're losing Pennsylvania and therefore Trump's pathway to winning is all but secured.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She should be up by four to five points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Not just because of one pollster having Harris plus four because if you're up by only one, hell, you're not even up by a point, you're still tied.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Even RMG research the same pollster, a bunch of people on Twitter ran around with two weeks ago saying Kamala Harris has a surge.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's up by five points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I'm not denying the idea that Kamala Harris is doing better than Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But if you're the Harris campaign, knowing that Biden was supposed to win Pennsylvania by six points at the same time back in 2020, you want to be up by four to five points at the bare minimum, not tied.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But yet again, it was because of pollsters like Sussacuan, Trafalgar, insider advantage, having Trump slightly ahead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They found Harris only up by a point.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So if her best polls are Harris plus one from Signal, which I know is Republican pollster, but they tend to be accurate more often than not.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If it's Harris plus one right now, that's not good, but it does show a consistent trend compared to just a week ago, a week ago, you had the New York Times Quinnipiac finding Harris plus three Harris plus four.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Some of the national polls suggest Trump's up again.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because if she is not winning by five points come September 1st, let alone just not even losing, if she's down by a point, she's cooked.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Hell, you could argue she's up by a point.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's probably done because that's supposed to be her best polling.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And she is doing piss poor even compared to Biden compared to Clinton.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's tied and that's with two garbage pollsters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Maybe it's wrong, maybe it's somehow overstates Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Democrats gained only 5,000, a quick reminder, this was happening right when the Harris quote unquote surge was happening.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And they got Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's not what Harris needed, they were banking on having a three month long surge till the election.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They were banking on that, but now it's clear that there really isn't any search for Harris and any surge.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If this pace keeps up for Trump, he's going to win Pennsylvania quite easily.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like I'm not saying by 10 points, but compared to like 2020 and 2016, he might win it by two to three points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is what I think many people have come to expect of Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"As Shapiro pointed out, the approach that Vice President Kamala Harris has taken during the course of her campaign has mostly been centered on increasing outreach to the rural communities of Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The visits that Harris made to regions such as Beaver County, which are often given less attention by national campaigns, were particularly acknowledged by him.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Shapiro believes that Harris is the best candidate for the state.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Specifically, he believes that this presents a strategic contrast to the campaign that is currently being run by Donald Trump, who was previously the President of the United States.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris has established many field offices throughout the state.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"According to Shapiro, this action is far more striking than the presence that Trump has created among the grassroots.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"People who are likely going to vote for Joe Biden are now not only voting for Kamala Harris, but they're also taking lawn signs, putting them on their lawn.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Shapiro added an additional indication of the ideological split that exists between the two parties when he compared this accomplishment to Trump's Project 2025, which has the purpose of eliminating the Department of Education.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Remember, it was he who packed the Supreme Court so that they would overturn Roe v. Wade, and it was he who ran to the microphones to claim credit for it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now continues doing so, it continues so, and now that he is facing pressure from the American people, he's doing what he's always done when he faced that pressure, which is he dodges, he ducks and he lies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's what he's doing here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You're at the checkout line and you see the president there, Donald Trump, coming to you with a hundred dollar bill.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So that was a huge surprise, and, yeah, it was just it was awesome to meet a former president and especially Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It was a packed weekend for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The former U.S. president was busy on his campaign trail.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump revisited the town where he survived his first assassination attempt, which was on the 13th of July.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Standing behind a bulletproof glass, Trump received a roaring welcome.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Joining Trump on stage was billionaire Elon Musk.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is a must-win situation, must win, donald Trump's campaign also shared aerial footage from Butler showing thousands of attendees.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz have begun a week-long media blitz where they will be interacting with media organizations and social media influencers across the country.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The Democrat is averaging at about 49.7%, while her Republican rival is at about 46.3%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"We are trying to abandon Harris, punish Harris, Biden administration and Harris administration.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I am playing it as if Trump might win and I should be more optimistic.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania yesterday or the day before yesterday, rather, was legitimately massive.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I know we joke a lot about the size of Trump's crowds and his hands and his everything.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so for anybody who's like, oh, no, no, no, Kamala Harris is going to win these swing states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump's winning Arizona, according to the Real Clear Politics average.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We should be optimistic that if we all get out and vote, Harris will win.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is ahead by four points here.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They think well at least he's owning the libs.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's really sticking it to them.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's okay as long as our side wins and and and by the way I'm sorry gentlemen I've noticed this especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior the bullying and the putting people down is a sign of strength and I am I am here to tell you that is not what real strength is.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Vote for Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States, vote for Tim Walz as the next vice president of the United States, vote for Bob Casey and this whole incredible Pennsylvania Democratic ticket, help your friends and family members and neighbors and co-workers do the same because if enough of us make our voices heard we will leave no doubt about the election outcome.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I was former president Obama wrapping up we're at times what we're at times passionate emotional remarks in Pittsburgh the first stop on his sprint through swing stage four Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You remember: he has, quote, concepts of a plan.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris left DC today for Pennsylvania, making a stop at a small business in Johnstown before heading to a rally in Wilkes-Barre tonight.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They're also doing more targeted interviews, Jeff.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris did one today with a local Pennsylvania anchor.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's going to be joining a live stream next week with Oprah Winfrey that is going to be with a lot of local grassroots groups, including ones that are targeting black voters, Latino voters, rural voters, you name it, across the board.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's also expected to potentially sit down with the National Association of Black Journalists as early as next week.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Because right now, even though she is still trying to reach undecided voters, that small sliver, Jeff, she very much is trying to close that enthusiasm gap that President Biden had with the key elements of her base.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I want to ask you about this far-right activist, this woman, Laura Loomer, who's been traveling with Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And she also recently made racist comments about Kamala Harris on social media site X. She said, if Kamala Harris wins, the White House will smell like curry, and White House speeches will be facilitated with a call center.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Former President Trump was asked about Laura Loomer today.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he did not disavow her, did not condemn her comments.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Specifically, when asked about her 9-11 conspiracy theories, he instead said that she is a supporter of his, who is a free spirit and a strong person.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"A free spirit, oK, so Lisa, how are Republicans responding to all of this: even Trump Republicans, as Laura mentioned, are responding quickly.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They think they see the danger here politically for this association.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that includes some Trump Republicans who themselves have had extreme speech.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This does not represent President Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But it's not just that side of the Trump spectrum.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Also, Tom Tillis, somewhat more moderate Trump supporter from North Carolina, wrote, Laura Loomer is a crazy conspiracy theorist who regularly utters disgusting garbage.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But the fact remains that Trump has not disassociated himself from her as much as some of his supporters will.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I want to talk about voters who support Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We've been to so many Trump events.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, Trump is pointing to FBI statistics and saying they're not the best one.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, he says people should pay attention to something called the National Crime Victimization Survey.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when Trump says that the other survey data shows more crime, he's not saying that it's relative to 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So there's more to it than what he says.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump returns to Harrisburg.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The brevity of it all, i didn't think he would run away.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And look at all this Trump support.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump support for as far as the eye can see.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Oh, it's a runaway Trump train.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's a runaway Trump train.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's a good catch, marcus Conte reporting live from the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Trump rally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump was, to show his love, try to win over the people of Pennsylvania to his side to become Republicans or whatever.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba, yeah, so lots of Trump love, i don't know about numbers, but I would probably I'd probably say is a few thousand people here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Trump is expected to speak tonight at 6 p.m. 6 p.m. He addresses the great the great center of the country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think it's working for Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We were fighting, we were fighting with Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They came here to support him because they know what will happen if Trump does not become president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So everybody's with Trump, they're all for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So I absolutely love Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I absolutely love him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But I'm pretty sure that if Kamala Harris gets elected, we will become a communist country.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I'm a she her woman everything.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I remember hearing that Kamala Harris went online and was like, you know how the Olympics were like the opening of the Olympics.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, so you think you think that Trump can win with all the cheating that goes on: i an assassination that's them two weeks ago, before the Republican Convention.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if he doesn't win, we all know what happened.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, we all know that Kamala Harris is like, like, so left.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So Kamala is trying to take his place.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Somebody else is running her shit.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The recent ruling provides a tangible victory that Trump's campaign can use to energize supporters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump can use the ruling to emphasize that his campaign is fighting for the principles he has championed throughout his political career.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If the ruling leads to fewer valid mail-in ballots for Democrats, it could increase Trump's chances of winning the state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It also enhances his legal and political strategy, shapes the narrative on election fraud, consolidates Republican support, and sets the stage for effective debate performance.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm just giving a deep dime and noticing some broadly, I would say Concerning very concerning for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So let's get right into it First of all Trump leads by point five.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He only needs Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Nothing else matters, so that's something key to remember Kamala Harris, let's give her Wisconsin and Michigan if she also gets Pennsylvania nothing else matters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Here is what it is Politico is headline is Kamala Harris is Pennsylvania problem and Joe Biden's local ties and cultural roots kept him competitive in a culturally conservative Northeastern Pennsylvania Harris's prospects and the heavily Catholic working-class region there are dice here Now obviously she skipped the Al Smith dinner.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He has a connection there and he was gonna be beaten there badly because after the debate his campaign was just collapsing but You know, obviously Harris is better than 2024 Biden is she as good as 2020 Biden: well, we don't know there Biden's local ties and cultural roots left him to victory in 2020 here But obviously as Democrats battle for the state Kamala Harris is their nominee, you know, she's not a Catholic man she is a California woman of color who is spearheaded post-dab as a porcelain messaging So she's an awkward fit political rights for the state of Pennsylvania, you know have a hard-pressed working-class region That's historically been a locus of anti-abortion activity So I don't know if every like if a majority of voters are actually anti-abortion but again, it's She does remind the voters there of She doesn't Biden reminded them of the older Democrats more focused on economic messages then Kamala who's focused more on abortion and democracy and other stuff like that and Obviously they say here Biden's discomfort we're talking about abortion may have been a Swiss spot modern for the Democrats but Paris by contrast like It's you know For voters that like Northeastern is Pennsylvania Catholics.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We don't have the local connection with Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's trying to distance himself from Harris very clearly.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So maybe as an internal poll with the race is a little bit closer than these polls show but and maybe you know Trump's beating combo that's a bigger takeaway because This was surprising to me.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Obviously Bob Casey Jr, supports Kamala Harris for president But this is a very interesting way to running his campaign here's a new ad he released and I just want you to see it because It's key to understanding What what's he trying to convey here, what's this message: so let's play this clip I'm a Republican and I'm a Democrat our marriage pure bliss, but on politics We just don't agree except for Bob Casey.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It's Bob Casey who's doing right by Pennsylvania I'm Bob Casey and I definitely approve this message so a surprising I could say a surprising advertisement because he is running on Trump's tariffs and and Buying and trying to restrict natural gas and oil which again tariffs are popular in Pennsylvania trying to ban fracking or restrict natural oil and gas That's not popular.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There's no question about it went Obama in 2012 when Trump in 2016 when Biden in 2020 the last two cycles just about 1500 votes each Separated the two candidates who we wanted to ask voters who have not made a firm decision yet who they want to vote for What they actually saw in this debate now These are voters that have in the past supported Republicans and Democrats they have in the past shown support for Former president Trump or for Joe Biden but coming into this night They told us that they had not made up their minds yet in this election So just to step back a little bit show our focus group to people Erie residents again Most important state most important County in that state We asked for a show of hands before the debate who hadn't made up their mind yet But thought this debate may determine where they would go with their vote to start With this debate.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's been a really great conversation There was another critical moment and this was Donald Trump's best moment based on your guys responses And it was when he was discussing Afghanistan.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If Kamala Harris wins Pennsylvania, she will be president.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris' team is running online ads targeting voters in Hispanic-heavy areas of eastern Pennsylvania and ads featuring Republican members who have voted for her on over 130 rural radio stations.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"According to a member of Trump's campaign, the former president has sent his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, Ohio, to more stops in Pennsylvania than anywhere else, this state is also where Trump held an exclusive meeting with Sean Hannity on Fox News.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"On October 2nd, Trump returned to Pennsylvania to hold two rallies in Scranton and Reading.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The vice president just laughed, but in fact, in September, Harris visited Pennsylvania once every three days, a remarkable frequency for a battleground state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her campaigns in Pennsylvania focus on policies that aim to improve the lives of residents, particularly in the post-COVID-19 context.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Therefore, when Democratic candidate Kamala Harris promotes her economic agenda, she heads to Pittsburgh, the industrial heart of Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"When announcing her running mate, she went to Philadelphia.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And when choosing the venue for her first rally featuring former President Barack Obama on October 10th, she once again returned to Pittsburgh.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump and the Republican Party's strategy, donald Trump, who won Pennsylvania in 2016, still enjoys strong support from rural and working-class voters in the state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump continues to emphasize issues related to immigration, border security, and opposing the expansion of social programs, which he argues contribute to the rising national debt.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"By focusing on these issues, Trump hopes to strengthen support from rural voters and attract more middle-class suburban voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"closing in on a decision, kamala Harris spends the weekend vetting top vice presidential contenders preparing for a battleground campaign blitz starting in Pennsylvania among the favorites to be the democratic running made Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro were taking the pulse of voters in Shapiro's hometown in Montgomery County.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Remember it was only two weeks ago President Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris to lead the party.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This is so dramatic and so different than anything that has happened before, all eyes are on Kamala Harris as we wait for the first major decision of her presidential campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Who will be her running mate: harris's decision is expected soon and CBS News reports she met with three finalists in Washington D. C. On sunday Arizona Senator Mark Kelly Minnesota Governor Tim Walls and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The three things she's looking for competence character and core values and she has to have a personal connection and relationship with that person.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think Josh Shapiro easily has the kind of pull where he can carry a state for for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Former White House aide to George H. W. Bush, Joe Watkins, believes Shapiro should be at the top of Harris's list.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris has struggled to attract independence, of course, swing voters and non college educated voters, which have been a harder sell for her to make.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Alright man, so we got some pretty big news for Kamala Harris here.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So Here's this article, it says Harris courts Polish American votes in Pennsylvania Polish Americans are an important if politically overlooked demographic, but in Pennsylvania many have tended to lean Republican So keep in mind Pennsylvania is a dog fight.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump would accede to mr.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump has suggested that a deal could be brokered to avert more suffering if Ukraine goes to Putin It is the beginning of a domino effect.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump or miss Harrison this November's election I'm firstly telling you right now Even like the smallest thing can be really massive in this race because it's gonna be so effing close Especially in a dogfight like Michigan is not a dogfight You know I mean like Arizona is not a dogfight in my opinion Michigan you probably definitely agree with but you know Pennsylvania is about to be a dogfight like anything could foot this effing state, right: so literally anything is super important and I think um Trump strategy is to sort of like alienate as many well not strategies Maybe not doing this on purpose But the Trump campaign keeps alienating more and more groups and so a common strategy appears to be to make a bigger and bigger tent So a bigger tent that she or a bigger group that she's opening up the tent to now is moderate Republicans Another group also, you know, like for example Trump is sort of alienating I guess a lot of JD Vance is doing a lot of it to where he was saying that you know Like grandmother's only role was to raise children and you know, childless women cat ladies or whatever He's they're alienating as many groups as humanly possible.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We'll call it the Kamala tent is what we're gonna we'll call it from here on out the Kamala tent That that's what we'll call it.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He accused the network of quote, deceitful editing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's campaign spokesperson, Caroline Levitt, responded, quote, 60 Minutes just admitted to doing exactly what President Trump accused them of doing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is another reminder of how hopelessly biased 60 Minutes is and how correct President Trump was to decline their invitation to be subjected to their fake news hackery.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I think the edited version makes it seem like Kamala Harris gave a much swifter, stronger response to the question about Netanyahu not caring whether the administration is against what he's doing.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The actual answer, the longer answer that is unedited, you saw her kind of fumbling through the response, making a claim that I don't think is true, that there were movements by Israel based on feedback we have given them.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What specifically is she pointing to, didn't we have a Rafa red line at one point: they went into Rafa anyway.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So when I watched this interview, I was also frustrated that it had been edited, but not necessarily... Clearly not for the same reasons that Donald Trump is frustrated.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Of course they didn't have that much time with her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And then there's the criticism of her answer.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So aside from her answer, which I do believe she needs to be much more clear on, at this stage, she should be very specific.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But she does need to have a better answer.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That happens on every network, and Donald Trump is using that as ammunition.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's smart on his part because he's always blaming the media.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But you know what: he does all the stuff.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So it has made it ground zero For these two candidates and it's like they say that no matter who loses Pennsylvania that candidate has much less of a chance of prevailing nationally Wow In 2016 you wrote that quote Trump's dissing of democracy will live in infamy and that he was a clear and present Danger to our Democratic values What specifically did you observe about Trump eight years ago that led you to make his claim far before January 6th: it's not necessarily that I was you know You know prescient before anybody else, but it was just so it was just so yeah, right It was just so obvious to me by what I was seeing and I think the two main things that I saw was that Before the 2016 election even happened.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I was a straight reporter No opinion and I had to kind of you know, I was trained to sort of remove myself in that sense and be dispassionate But I got to the point after 16 years where I felt I knew enough about politics I knew enough about how these people You know strategized Where I really wanted to have more of my own voice because I always liked writing with style So that's why I kind of I moved to commentary because I felt at that point That I had earned enough I had earned enough experience to be able to sort of say what I thought was really was really going on And you know and that's obviously a little bit tricky for some readers because then you get people who are really get angry with your point of view And but I was you know, I was fine with that and I still am And so I've been writing commentary ever since and it obviously it is partisan in the sense that you know, I think you know One side is more correct than the other side But as I try to emphasize I really really believe this that I don't see this as Democratic Democrat versus Republican I see this as facts and truth versus untruths and lies and to me that is you know that to me is the dividing line and if it's partisan to say that factual reality Should be the priority and if it's partisan to say that lies Wrong, then I guess that makes me a partisan In 1988 you wrote the making of an image for the inquirer about the GOP's pioneering TV attack ads How has the role of political journalism changed during your lifetime along this evolving media landscape, and how do you see it going in the future the ads in 1988 and that whole campaign: it really I think further diminished At least print political journalism and we were writing about what was going on on TV all the time but that really that rose was really the beginning of the change and With the internet came the explosion of media sites that everybody could start to really Good silo themselves with sites that perhaps spoke to their own political preconceptions and so the old Gatekeepers which was New York Times Washington Post maybe Wall Street Journal somewhat the LA Times ABC NBC CBS those were the main gatekeepers Well, their impact started to really diminish and that fragmentation has accelerated ever since to where we are today What what Kamala Harris has done this week was a perfect example of what I'm talking about that the mainstream outlets They all want interviews whether you know, which basically it's like, you know, we're the professional journalists We know the most about issues.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"No, they're not she's not talking to them she's talking to these, you know podcasts like you know the one today caller daddy and Howard Stern and the view on TV so These niche audiences late night TV late night talk shows.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Maybe they're persuadable Whereas most of the people who read mainstream Print media in particular, you know, they they already know politics really well They've made up their minds a long time ago So that she's decided to waste of time to to go to them because you've got all these other outlets And lastly, what advice you have for students ahead of this upcoming election: well two things first is we are flooded with disinformation like never before and I think it's imperative for everybody Penn students especially to To guard against being swept away by lies and stuff that is just meant to sort of pollute the atmosphere pollute the media ecosystem and You know look at the fact-checking websites for which there are three or four including factcheck.org here at Penn and PolitiFact Dot-com is another one, but that's one of the things that everybody needs to guard against to be good citizens But the second thing is that there is still time if you haven't done it to register to vote in Pennsylvania as opposed to where your parents live For example, this is just as we started this conversation.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"254, top right at the screen, 226 for the Dems, so if Donald Trump were to win Pennsylvania, he really wouldn't need much more, just 16 electoral votes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Then if he wins Nevada, 271, 270 needed to win.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then she has the slight advantage.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So let's look at some of the possibilities for her, this is what we talked about a lot on Friday, right: where you have the blue wall strategy and you have the sunbelt strategy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's exactly 220, but again, if Pennsylvania stays blue for Harris with 19 electoral votes, she has other options.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If Harris does again, she's not there yet.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
All the counties around there are Trump Country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When you come back east, it's not just the city of Philadelphia where Biden did well and Harris undoubtedly will as well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This might not seem like much, but it marks a significant change from earlier this year when Trump led President Joe Biden by five points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris's growth in Pennsylvania underscores how critical this state has become.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris has made impressive gains among younger voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The suburban surge, Harris's key to victory: perhaps the most dramatic development in Pennsylvania is Harris's surge in suburban areas.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania

Leading Trump by a comfortable margin of 58% to 33%.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's message of economic strength and job creation resonates strongly with voters concerned about inflation.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This reflects the strong support Trump has built among voters who prioritize border security and tougher immigration policies.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris's ability to consolidate support among younger voters and suburban residents in Pennsylvania has given her a narrow lead.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The question is, will Harris's surge in Pennsylvania be enough to counterbalance Trump's strength in Florida: the answer could hinge on turnout.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And basically how it works is that if Biden doesn't win Pennsylvania, the chances of him and Trump going to a 269-269 electoral college tie is exponentially higher.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Essentially all Biden needs to do is keep the blue wall, which is Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and then if Trump can flip Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada, I mean, we can move into the unprecedented electoral tie.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Talk a little bit about what's going on there, yeah, so I mean, after 2016, Trump really starts to lose the suburban vote, especially the suburban women vote.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I don't think she's very likely to endorse Biden, but it's possible she never endorsed his Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so some of these voters are out there, what is the Biden campaign doing to try to appeal to them: so I find it very interesting that the Biden campaign, they're launching this six figure ad by, you know, where they highlight Trump essentially slamming Haley over and over again.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And to your point, Haley has not made it seem that she wants her supporters to vote for Biden, although she also hasn't endorsed Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And as of right now, her and Trump have not spoken.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Definitely, the next Biden versus Trump rematch, yeah, thank you, Mabinti, you can read Mabinti and the rest of our political teams coverage at WashingtonExaminer.com.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, Trump campaign officials tell us that's no coincidence, but they built this office as a campaign office for all.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We first met the duo, both of Dominican descent, before former President Trump survived an assassination attempt and picked JD Vance as his running mate.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Both voters remain firmly undecided, but newly energized, she has direction, and I think it evens a playing field for the two candidates.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's just, I don't trust her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Why: because her background, I don't trust her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania

"Think Arizona, Georgia, so Trump knows that if he wins here, he's on a really good path to maybe winning.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"During and after the debate, Donald Trump seemed to be on the defense.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, on the other side, Donald Trump, he is really leaning into his traditional base of support.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He was out there camp on the road with a right wing activist, Laurel Lumer, and sort of trying to announce new policy initiatives, like something like No Taxes on Overtime, really leaning into blue collar voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's talked about the strain on health care and housing.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But it was interesting, ABC got an interview with him and he also talked about how Trump's words are not helping.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The boy's father has also spoken out, really asking Trump to stop.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We do know that when Trump was president, he worked to try to overturn temporary protective status, those sort of visas for Haitian immigrants.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What about the Taylor Swift effect, right, with the singer endorsing Kamala Harris, do these high profile endorsements even matter that much: well, look, what I'll say is that in the 24 hours after Taylor Swift made that endorsement on Instagram, the voter registration site, vote.gov, said it saw 400,000 plus people visit it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is trying to juice the margins.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I don't think she understands Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Here is one thing that she is going to do, legalize recreational marijuana for black Americans.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Inside Team Harris's unusual levels of finger pointing, which is very typical for these people, where there's no leadership at all.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They say that some Harris aides lack relationships with key party figures, particularly in Philadelphia and its suburbs.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Which is strange, because Kamala is a person of color, and they tell us that that's super important.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So some are even pointing fingers at her campaign manager, Nikki Liu.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Uh-oh, latino and black Democratic leaders met with Harris officials behind closed doors in separate meetings in Philadelphia late last month, said five people who attended or who were briefed on it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala has a lot going on here, man.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now Harris's path to victory depends on her ability to turn out the Democratic voters of Philly.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He said she's an African-American woman who won office last year on a tough on crime message and when help Harris went over disillusioned black voters and working class white men.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"All right, so use the proper labels, now the Harris campaign provided a list of politico of several examples of surrogate events aimed at engaging voters of color, actress America and Ferrera and others are all going to be there.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is going to create an opportunity agenda for black men.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So when Trump said the word black jobs, remember they lambasted him for that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now she's good paying jobs for black men which I think is different.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And if black men weren't excited about that enough because Kamala Harris is going to be creating new opportunities.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Well she has a whole post dedicated to that one which is boom.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, sent people to jail, she was a prosecutor.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So says Kamala Harris will legalize recreational marijuana breaking down unjust barriers that hold black men and other Americans back and making sure black Americans have opportunities to succeed as the marketplace takes shape.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Well she prosecuted black men for marijuana and other drug crimes.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So we'll see how it works out for her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The hip hop community needs to hear more from VP Harris about what is her plans and plans of action for black males.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
A lot of black males are not into the Harris campaign.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So yeah they're just not into Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The former first lady has been working behind the scenes to boost Harris and they're expected to have her appear on the campaign trail but it hasn't happened yet.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Many would like to see helping Harris is not there, she's absent from the campaign trail.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Two people familiar with this said that she has expressed fresh concerns about security following two assassination attempts against Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Well Trump's getting shot at so they're going to shoot at me.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is taking Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here's Eric Doherty over on X, breaking Harris campaign, pulls back Milwaukee, Wisconsin advertising, and diverts it to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania amid concerns of lagging turnout.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There's still an inside straight she could get, but largely if Trump takes Pennsylvania, he's got this.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She compared it to big tobacco saying they knew the effects of climate change.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's Democrats, they love using law fair to get their agenda done, but that's CNN burning on Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I made Trump the favorite there, as do most of my Democratic sources, but she's spending an unprecedented amount of money.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She'll continue to work it there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's a place where trading out Biden for Harris was probably a downgrade for them.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Here's Time Magazine, harris declined repeated request for an interview for this story.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"All right, obviously that is extremely different than what she is presenting right now.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's now lying, and she hasn't given a reason why she changed her position.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Only she just goes, was I, I was against fracking: now we're for it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She never says why, because she always said it was some kind of a crime.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But this isn't the only thing that she's flipped on that you found and you found a lot of other inconsistencies.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, she's flip flopped on a lot of issues related to energy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She said she was going to ban plastic straws.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She said she was going to ban fracking.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And she said she would eliminate the filibuster to pass the Green New Deal now.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, why isn't she telling you the truth about her positions and her goals: but again, CNN is done with her garbage.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Why do you think CNN is putting distance between them and Harris, do they not smell the looze already: they don't want to be part of it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They were exaggerating to help Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But it's not just Kamala Harris that's getting smashed by media.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Ask her why she only goes on programs of people too weak to actually challenge her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He got a hold of Kamala Harris' medical report on this tweet.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"As to her completely desperate request from my medical statement, she's dying to see my cholesterol, which is 180.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"According to her doctor's report, she suffers from urticaria, defined as a rash of round red welts on the skin that itch intensely, sometimes with dangerous swelling.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She also has allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis, a very messy and dangerous situation.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
These are deeply serious conditions that clearly impact her functioning.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Maybe that's why she can't answer even the simplest of questions asked by 60 Minutes and others.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Okay, Grandma, do you wanna vote for the first black woman president ever: okay, she's a Democrat too.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Here's the poly market, trump is higher than ever.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This just released, pennsylvania has flipped for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Has Donald Trump up three: their polls in Pennsylvania in 2020 were amazing.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now Trump is plus three in Pennsylvania and you do have the Senate very close with Casey only up by two over McCormick.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Some of these swing states really tightening some of them like Michigan and Pennsylvania flipping to where Trump is leading and Wisconsin is basically tied.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The new Rasmussen poll has not been put in for Pennsylvania and Trump is still sitting plus 0.1.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So once Bloomberg gets knocked out, although there's going to be probably more Bloomberg polls that come in, that's, that's going to be annoying, but I don't think it's going to be Harris plus five.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, he's starting to lead all these states and these are, these are really good polling numbers for Trump in states like Pennsylvania where the margin is going to be very slim, but if you get a plus three, a plus four, you will have the overall edge in terms of the aggregate.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And really, I thought there was going to be some correction and maybe there was some slight correction cause Trump went up by about 12 and it's come back down a little bit.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But nonetheless, you are seeing Trump, this is very healthy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Either way, Donald Trump looks really, really good right now, especially in Pennsylvania with that new poll.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, Bill Clinton is like campaigning for Trump at this point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And America is not having enough, so Bill Clinton is coming out and endorsing Trump, basically.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You had a plus three, remember, Trump basically swept all the swing states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If you're a Republican, there would have to be a crazy deviation that we haven't seen in over two decades for it to signal a Harris victory because if she wins the popular vote by a point, she's not winning the electoral college even with the recent shifts we're going to that we've seen in New York and possibly Illinois and California and Florida and all of those states are getting more conservative.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And we do know that even if Trump wins Pennsylvania by two and a half to three, that's still a close race.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Part of that was because they wanted Trump to be up so they could pressure Biden to drop out its political strategy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's why they leaked all the internal polls that said Biden was losing New Mexico.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She was three and a half years as VP.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She was one of the most unlikable VPs ever.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And her approval rating is going back down basically even with Trump, which would be a death sentence for her campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He's maintaining a big lead, which I didn't even expect.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's been no correction, trump is maintaining a 10 point lead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"RFK juniors endorsed Trump, so he's not going to take much from Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's going to be the, this is the best Trump is polling by far.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What was it: nBC that had Harris plus six.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now they've got Harris plus two.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump's winning over 300 electoral votes based on electoral math.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And the Rasmussen poll has Trump plus three and that's going to have to be inputted because they do input that they put in.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Would you look at that Rasmussen: it bumps Trump up.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"See, once they drop that Bloomberg out, it Trump's going to go up to like a point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm telling you, but Trump's not sitting plus point three.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump sitting plus point three.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They've got Trump up by two.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This morning, the Cook Political Report moved three battleground states that are key, Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada, from lean Republican to toss-up, citing increased Democratic energy and unity around Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think it bodes well for her judgment and her willingness to now continue the good work of the Biden-Harris administration.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I'm excited to see Kamala Harris continue that and take that campaign to western Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Does she need to differentiate herself a little bit, show maybe a specific vision that is separate from the work that she had as vice president underneath President Biden: look, she's going to be her own candidate, and she is.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I saw it in Philadelphia when she and Governor Walz fired up that crowd in Philly.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What's your reaction to that, does she need to do a bit of a better job selling her vision for the economy, does she need to introduce that to voters: she's been our nominee now only for a few weeks, so of course you've got some campaigning to do.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And folks know that Vice President Harris has been part of administrations, been standing up for working people and standing up for folks' freedom.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's going to be part of, I know, Vice President Harris's message in western Pennsylvania and all over the country.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Do you think that it's time for her to sit down for an interview and explain that decision to change course on some of these issues and take some tough questions from members of the media: look, I know Donald Trump doesn't have anything to do other than campaigning.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's the vice president of the United States and is helping President Biden navigate crises across the globe and here at home.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's the job, i think folks saw the way Donald Trump did that job, which is why we kicked him out of office after four years.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Vice President Harris, I am sure, is going to be open with the press.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I know she's been talking to folks to and from on the flights.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And look, the contrast between transparency on her part and Donald Trump is just tremendous.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, this is a guy who makes it up as he goes along, can't find a lie that he doesn't love.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Her campaign now says that she supports.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's where the Biden Harris administration has been.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So that's the right decision for Vice President Harris to make.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And frankly, the fact that she has so strong support from the union movement, from folks in labor, tells you about her values, tells you about who she is as a candidate and why labor is going to be showing up for her in Pennsylvania come November.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I don't forget the insurrection he tried to lead and failed at leading.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It was very much the same place where it was between Trump and Biden.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So yesterday, Raphael Warnock, her surrogate on Meet the Press, gets asked about Kamala Harris' mandatory buyback of guns program from 2019.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And he doesn't say, oh, no, she's not for that anymore.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"No Republican ever won Erie, and but he did.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged by all-time favorite chart and let's listen to Pavarotti sing Ave Maria.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He blamed a lack of air conditioning and called for music to be played.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She did that at the rally today.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So with President Joe Biden, you know, announcing this summer that he would not seek reelection and then Kamala Harris quickly coalescing support to become the Democratic nominee.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She had a really sort of burst of momentum, you know, through her coalescing that support through the DNC, the Democratic National Convention where, you know, she officially took officially became the nominee through the debate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Small stuff like 60 Minutes, but also non-traditional podcasts and radio shows, i mean, she's clearly trying to do something to shake the race up.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are getting some real early voting data this time out of Pennsylvania, Donald Trump flipping a very important county.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Very hard for Donald Trump to make that up.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And also the fact that I expect Donald Trump to just win independence in Pennsylvania and really all these swing States.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is why Trump needs to come in, they're signing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump doing so much better in terms of voter registration, early voting, all of the counties compared to what's going on with the Democrats to where they're literally signing artillery shells in a factory in Pennsylvania that are being used to escalate or potential World War three scenario.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Wow, this is crazy, and the fact that we saw this back to back, you've got Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We're going to get that again, call us racist when we elect Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is a perfect example, we've got Trump and by the way, I think Trump's going to be in Pennsylvania tonight.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Oh, that's great news, trump is doing a rally in Pennsylvania tonight.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So Trump is going to be doing a rally.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's flipping all these counties.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He survived two assassination attempts.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're still trying to kill him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Liberals say if he dies, it's his fault.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is an illustration of why Donald Trump is going to win the state of Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is doing better, it's just like Virginia to where all the top counties, they're all Republican and Trump is doing very well in Pennsylvania right now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump can win the election without even knowing if he won Pennsylvania, if he wins some other important states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But even without Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Trump can still win the election and it can be decided by about 2 a.m. with a call by all the major networks.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But again, Trump can win the election without Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is going to be better than 2020, so maybe there still is a chance that these states do get called at around two or three a.m. If Trump can win Pennsylvania by two or three points, I think it is possible.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But either way, right now, Pennsylvania looks very good for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The early voting looks very good, he's flipping counties and you've got Democrats, you know, signing artillery shells to be used as an escalation force to trend to World War Three.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is not good stuff, the people of Pennsylvania, they see this and they see the attacks that Trump is under.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's why they're going to vote for him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's just the reality, we're going to be electing Trump because Trump is looking for a de-escalation of this war.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he's already talked to Zelensky.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's already talked to Putin.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Pennsylvania primaries took place today and the results were devastating for Donald Trump and expectations were exceeded for President Biden and Democrats.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"On the other hand, Donald Trump only got slightly over 80% of the votes, about 460,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Take a look at Chester County, Donald Trump, 49.2%, Nikki Haley, 45.2%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if you want to take a look at, look at Cumberland, Crawford, Donald Trump underperforming there as well.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is on track.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He said to get less than 70%.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's about 30% of the GOP casting a protest vote against Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is not winning Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's not winning this country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump decided to give an interview in with the, the biggest Pennsylvania local media station, Action News.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's ABC six, and Donald Trump told ABC six, he was bragging about terminating Roe v Wade.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He says, how great it is that women's reproductive rights have been taken away because of his own action and how very happy people are that Donald Trump overturned Roe v Wade.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here's his interview with Pennsylvania's Action News, ABC six.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When you do that, we'll teach Donald Trump and extreme migrant Republicans a valuable lesson.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then he calls the New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He calls her maggot Hagerman.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Trump says maggot Hagerman of the failing New York Times falsely reported that I was disappointed with the crowds.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So that's how Donald Trump spending his time.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And folks, the trends are overwhelming pro democracy and rejecting the madness, rejecting the chaos, rejecting the meanness, rejecting the wannabe fascism, rejecting the attack on our democracy, rejecting the loserness, the weirdness, all of that that Donald Trump represents and supporting on the other hand, President Biden and the pro democracy movement, normalcy, democracy, our Constitution, actually delivering things, policies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When she unveiled her running mate, she went to Philly.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"When she had to pick a place for Obama's first fall rally, it was back to Pittsburgh.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Large population of black voters who Dems need to mobilize has fast-growing, highly educated, mostly white suburbs outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where Republicans have been bleeding support in the Trump years.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"At the same time, Trump is such a unique figure that he's so much better and more appealing to Republican voters or even swing voters than in Oz or in a, or even a Dave McCormick, if you look at how much more he's running ahead of him, that maybe he's the only guy left in America who could still win of the state of Pennsylvania as a Republican.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's what helped Trump to spin his tails about how the election was stolen in, you know, Philadelphia, blah, blah, blah.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The other thing to point out about Pennsylvania is, you know, Trump just had his giant rally in Butler, Pennsylvania with Elon Musk.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"New York Times interviewed some local supporters who were really energized, inspired by, you know, his reaction in that moment and decided, you know, not only am I gonna vote for him, I'm gonna volunteer, I'm gonna be a like precinct captain or whatever.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The ads are just everywhere, and also like I said, the choice of those ads were Trump, every ad, immigration, immigration, immigration, immigration, migrant, immigration, and then there were some Dave McCormick ads, which tried to do that thing where he's like, Bob Casey's the real radical on abortion, but from Bob Casey and from Kamala, it was abortion all day long.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There have been a number of events, Harris interviews.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A month ago, Harris was actually above water, as they say, 48 percent favorable and 45 percent negative a month ago.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She had a clear advantage on this basic question of the perception of the candidates.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
What are you seeing there: and I think that's another weight that Harris is sort of facing here.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So Harris weighted down by this, and Trump, there's sort of a bit of a positive reassessment of him since he's been president by some folks that might be helping him as well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They're saying those policies helped their families.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Thank you so much, Steve Kornacki, so, Dasha, Trump is back in Pennsylvania tonight.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This weekend, we heard some of his most alarming rhetoric yet framing his political opponents as criminals and enemies.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Take a listen to some of what he said over the weekend.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now he is here in Pennsylvania over the weekend.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Democrats taking more advantage of that option than Republicans of the former president did encourage his supporters over the weekend to vote early, vote by mail.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He clearly has these tendencies, strongman tendencies, but he is also saying that if he gets reelected, he will, he intends to act against his political opponents.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He mentioned that perhaps he should revoke CBS broadcasting license.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I think the most disconcerting part when you hear the most aggressive, darkest themes from Donald Trump is that you also have to consider that it reflects the support of a large portion of this country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, he's never received over 50 percent, so it's not a majority of the country, but about 48 percent of the country is prepared to vote for Donald Trump and those messages.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Did Donald Trump lose: ask the question and you know, that's the question.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You want to say rigged, you want to say he won.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And the Harris campaign really clipped that moment, pushed it out on social media.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Voters, especially persuadable voters, want Harris to talk about the economy and immigration.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Those are areas where she could really draw separation with herself and Joe Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And that's something that she's particularly under pressure to do right now.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And yet she hasn't really been able to answer that question when it comes to her about how she would be different than Joe Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Congressman Vance also said Trump's attorney general pick will be more important than his VP pick if he is elected here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What's your view on this, will there be any guardrails for another Trump presidency: you've already talked about how he has already talked about going after his political opponents.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump just mowed them over.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He will use lawfare.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He will use the Department of Justice.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He will use the IRS to go after people.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Should that worry Republicans: well, Harris is certainly using this issue.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is something that she has a lot of credibility on.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She was talking about it before she was even running.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And it's a huge one that she has a difference from Joe Biden, who really, frankly, was uncomfortable talking about this issue.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I think we're really seeing her push that and this media blitz.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So the campaign is certainly trying to find ways for her to continue to message on this.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That is what Republicans have unleashed on Vice President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Decide the poll of the revisionist history of his years, so many people adhere to the vice president's message that they're not going back.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They just don't want to go back to the chaos of the Trump years.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, she is further left than Hillary.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, she will probably hit somewhere where Obama hit or Hillary hit.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And you know, the other counties, that's where her challenge will be Erie County, North Hampton County, Cambria County.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's against fracking.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Unless she does a John Kerry, I was for the Iraq war before I was against it, before I was for it, before I was against it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, Selena, I want to my view of the world is there is only one selection for Kamala Harris for her running mate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think he will deliver the state to her if she is selected.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is not the guy I voted for because they they voted for Trump and him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so they're challenged by that, and and so I don't think he takes it because it takes away his opportunity to not only finish out his first term and go into his second term, but also to prove himself to the people of the state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, last question, Selena, do you think Democrats can hide the real Kamala Harris from America for 100 days: i mean, they're going to try.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump got a major victory in the state of Pennsylvania within the last 24 hours that could single handedly change the results of the election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign and the RNC secured a major victory with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court this week.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's from Russia because they want Trump to win.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let's remember when it comes to October surprises, understand this with the Trump October surprise.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Don't you think Trump at that point being an incumbent, they would throw everything they had at Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They wouldn't save anything because you would think that'd be the last time Trump would run.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He was like the second highest donor to their campaign saying that they manipulated the election with big tech.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And it's again, the same, the same script she used during the debate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Last night, Kamala Harris had a rally at like a preschool gym.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's how bad it's getting, but here she is.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Remember, they've got the Biden chip, they replace it with the Kamala.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now everyone's for Kamala, but it's like they give they've given her a chip and the factory settings is this story.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But all of this is super scary, and of course, I mean, it's like you ask Kamala Harris, well, we're on the brink of World War Three.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is very well received with the Amish to give you an idea.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump created all of these voters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They like the economy under Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's amazing, i'm going to tell you, this is the first time I've seen a Trump sign being a flag being flown on the back of a buggy from the horse and buggy from the Amish country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"A lot of people don't realize this, but outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, it is Trump country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And they just have a lot of admiration for Donald Trump and the family.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And they don't know why they should trust Kamala Hara, who's had four years to do something and hasn't done anything and now is acting like she's going to change all this around.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's the one that's caused all of this.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump won that by 29 and 24 points the last two elections.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Cumberland, Donald Trump won that by 18 and 10.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because if Kamala can't win Pennsylvania, she's not winning.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And if Trump wins Pennsylvania, it's over.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, we see Harris, Heels Up Harris is an average lead of 0.6 percent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that's based on these two right here, Quinnipiac and the New York Times, which has Harris up five and four.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But we have right here for these two guys, and we see the Hill, Marist.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So the first thing we're gonna see here is we're gonna come up here, of course, I mean, I started doing a video, someone wants to go outside, someone being the big baby over there, the big old, it's raining outside, puppy, rain outside, right, so you can see Heels Up and President Trump are 48, 48, all right, see, Trump is winning 59 to 36 among men, and Heels Up is winning 59 to 38 among the ladies, all right, so a pretty significant divide among the genders, but how can you say that, why aren't there eight genders, the interesting thing is Bob Casey, the incumbent Democrat, still holds a 5% lead against the challenger in Pennsylvania in this poll, all right: so if this is definitely leaning Republican oriented for the poll, then Casey would probably be losing, but he's not, and we're gonna show you something else here too.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She is the Vice President of the United States for having a sake.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's pretty big, man, one of the negatives on this poll is that they interview three quarters are white, all right, and generally speaking, the whites are gonna vote for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump needs over 60% of the white vote to win.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's just no other way around, he's got, if Trump could get 65% of the white vote, he's not losing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So we have more women than men, more rich people than Trump's base and whites.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's Trump stuff.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We see 46, 46, heels up to Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
47% voted for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so that's what we got to look at, so and they always under sample Trump too.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
CBS News campaign reporter Aaron Navarro is joining us now with more on the Harris team's movements.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The Harris Waltz campaign is doing a Labor Day blitz with some help from President Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"State Democrats are looking to keep not that competitive this November, but they know that the working class type of voter, that archetype is something that has historically been at least curious about former President Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's one big survey out Sunday, it's suggested Harris got no notable convention polling bounce, which I don't think is a complete surprise because, you know, once she shifted to the top of the ticket, there was this ground swell of enthusiasm, which, you know, one could say that would have been what happened after perhaps the DNC, instead she got it before.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris really doesn't have that option.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's got to do both simultaneously, what do we know about how she's preparing: it's a truncated schedule.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We know that she's going to be obviously traveling today.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump's team is okay with it being muted, saying it's the same rules as the CNN one.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"They said, quote, policy flip flops have put Vice President Camilla Harris in a in a hot seat in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania with energy workers telling Fox News that, quote, nobody believes her change of heart on fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So yesterday I went to the swing state of Pennsylvania to the town of Zelia, Nopal to speak with word energy workers who say they don't trust Harris and her flip flops on fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It's much easier to work under a Trump administration than this administration by far.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Why should America: and that's why, and that's one of Donald Trump's key policy positions is to lower, get rid of the regulations.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Haskemilla Harris holding a narrow one point lead within the margin of error for most polls.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But the last couple of polls you will note have Trump starting to take the lead back.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We begin with the race for the White House where former President Barack Obama hit the campaign trail for Kamala Harris in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania on Thursday.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Speaking to a large audience of men and men of color, President Obama urged them to do the right thing and vote for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I'm sorry gentlemen, I've noticed this especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down is a sign of strength.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Taking shots at the Republican presidential nominee, the former president called Donald Trump a whiny old billionaire who is obsessed with himself.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I've said it before, Donald Trump is a 78 year old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The 44th president known for his calm and cool demeanor expressed a burst of emotions rarely seen as he accused Donald Trump of threatening America's democracy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"One that helps us work together instead of turning against each other, pennsylvania, we're ready for President Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
President Obama's appearance on the campaign trail showing support for Kamala Harris comes at a crucial time.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The race is still too close to call and the Harris campaign is deploying its big guns to help seal the deal.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Former President Bill Clinton is also expected to hit the campaign trail for Harris as both sides make their closing arguments to the voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yesterday, Donald Trump's town hall event just outside of Philadelphia was seemingly cut short when members of the crowd fainted.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump, on the other hand, in a town hall outside of Philadelphia held an event where he was focused on support from suburban women.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There were a couple of people who needed medical assistance, and he commented on that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris will be looking to do really well in not just Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and their suburbs, but also in some of the smaller cities.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala doesn't give a frack about you.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's accusing Vice President Kamala Harris of flip-flopping on fracking, which she now says she will not ban.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is making her own play for rural Republicans with ads like this one.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They've already made up their minds for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What's up, guys, boy, Benny: not all Trump parades are made equal.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Some are just built different, like, Amish Trump parades in Pennsylvania with horse and buggy and Trump flag.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is your president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This energy and your black filling, look at this, here's Donald Trump last night in Pennsylvania with the Amish behind him, these dudes, that's great.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The senator from Pennsylvania, John Fetterman, warns Democrats that Donald Trump is far more popular in Pennsylvania than they think.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Think about that, john Fetterman went on to to say he was going to vote for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And what sounds like he's saying he's going to vote for Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When you hear it, what you hear is he's talking to Pennsylvania voters saying that they don't like Trump style, but they're going to vote for him anyway.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So I think this was this was him being rhetorical, right, and talking about an interaction right that he could that he could potentially have with the Pennsylvania voter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This isn't John Fetterman saying he's going to vote for Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I don't think John Fetterman saying he's going to vote for Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is going to be strong, and that's we have to respect that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What does Trump say when he's there: he's just freaking hilarious.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Why do you think people love Trump: your job, which is a good job, an energy job.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The legend, we'll never get one like Trump again.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What does that mean: it means now now corporate polls are showing that Donald Trump is back, baby.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump's back ahead, now starts the surge.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Hey, Donald Trump is your president.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because you know, this Trump train don't stop.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Today Kamala Harris unveiling a new plan to cover in-home health care for seniors.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So things have certainly gotten better for Kamala Harris than they were for Biden, but I think it's still advantage Republican.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It could be longer, i wonder if there might be some motivation to change that law, Senator, when Donald Trump claims victory at nine thirty at night on election day, are you worried about reliving this again: look, I think it's a it's a valid concern.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If if Donald Trump does not win the election, do you think he's going to admit that he lost: i don't think so.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, we have a new poll that came out today from Harvard Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Not to be confused with Kamala Harris, but the poll shows that this race nationally is a dead heat.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And this might be the final poll they end up dropping too.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He was never polling this high and the electoral college is what dictates the outcome.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's true, i mean, the head pollster there is a Trump supporter wants Donald Trump to win.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They dropped a poll with Trump leading by three percentage points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now they have Donald Trump leading by three points and we got a poll from the New York Times that shows the opposite.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But here's the deal, the New York Times still doesn't understand how to pull the rust belt, especially when Donald Trump is on the ballot.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You would probably anticipate Donald Trump to do better.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
A lot of people talk about the shy Trump voter.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think it's more the hidden Trump voter.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I think the shy Trump voter was always kind of like a false way of explaining it, especially as pollsters nowadays typically don't poll by phone as much as they used to.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I know there's a myth out there that'll say, well, Donald Trump is only polling so well because right-leaning pollsters, they say, are flooding the zone.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're showing Trump up.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And even the New York Times could only pull a Harris plus one.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A lot of the people that are registering to vote to vote against Donald Trump, they're not typically going to be registered as Republicans.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when it comes to a state like Pennsylvania where Trump is expanding his lead, it's just common sense.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Use your common sense, do you think that Kamala Harris is going to do as well with these white working class voters, you know, compared to somebody like Joe Biden: of course not.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There's even an argument to be made, she may not do as well as somebody like Hillary, you know, who did very poorly with these people.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
You could easily see Donald Trump make massive gains.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, you're talking about close to 10 point gains with these types of voters, and that would put him at 50 percent.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And even if he does lose some with, you know, white college educated voters, he loses some of these supporters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's likely set to gain some.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We could debate how much, but he's likely to gain some.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's likely to gain with Hispanic voters as well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I know the polls didn't have him up by like three to four and I'm not even saying he's going to win the state by this margin.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But is it possible that he does well enough: it's absolutely possible.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris is not really gaining a lot from 2020 and there's a lot of room that she apparently would have to grow.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's not exactly getting it, even if she's improving slightly.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And I don't even think Harris is really that strong of a candidate when it comes to these like, you know, millennial men, for example, which, you know, typically when they grow up as well, they're going to be, you could argue, moving to the right.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Anyone who will not bend to his will, those are part of her remarks.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
When you hear and I want to ask you something that she's kind of asking us all to do.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So let's talk about what he's saying and what it means.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When you hear Trump talk about the enemy from within, what do you hear: i hear echoes of Victor Orban, of Vladimir Putin, of Nicholas Maduro.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he's already done the first two, and now he's coming after the third, which is toâ€”instead of us being opponents, he's calling us enemies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"One is that Vice President Harris has been very intentional from the start of this campaign to treat every single voting cohort with the respect they are due, meaning she does not take anyone for granted and she has worked hard to cultivate and curate policies that speak to their needs.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump has been part of that.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But so have the policies he plans to reinstate.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Access to capital is one of the strongest barriers to starting your own small business, and he will eliminate that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What he has said and what he will do is return us to a time when young black men are walled off from opportunity.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, what he is willing to do is to lie about his intentions.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if you listen to his lies, it's like listening to Santa Claus.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's what Kamala Harris is doing.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's saying we have not done everything we need to.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But she has a plan to address those challenges.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her willingness to speak directly to a community is a sign of respect.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And with Harris only recently becoming the Democratic nominee, voters say they want to hear more about her policy proposals.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"On Capitol Hill, Trump allies advised him to steer clear of personal attacks.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I think President Trump would be wise to explain how he would change the country, stay away from the personal stuff, talk about policy differences.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You may remember debated Harris back during 2019 Democratic primary season.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If Trump wins, he's always anti, you know, like kick, let's kick everybody out and build a brick wall.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They also said Trump knows Pennsylvania voters better than her.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He understands the issues that they are facing.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He supported our energy independence.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Vice President Kamala Harris tells union workers in Pittsburgh she'll oppose the sale of U.S. Steel.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"President Joe Biden is no stranger to Pittsburgh's Labor Day activities, but Tom Reiss with our partner WESA in Pittsburgh reports this year he was campaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This year he made Pittsburgh the site of his first joint campaign appearance with Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
A bid to ensure his allies and organized labor will bolster Harris' run for president.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But he also criticized her Republican opponent this fall, arguing that former President Donald Trump would be more likely to cross a picket line than to join one.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Meantime Harris used the joint campaign appearance to say U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris' remarks concur with the White House's months-long opposition to the company's planned sale to Nippon Steel of Japan.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, is scheduled to be sentenced in his New York hush money case on the 18th.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Zooming out, Harris has a slight edge nationally.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Why is she honing in on this particular area of the state: so, Lindsay, anyone from Pennsylvania will tell you that the eastern part of the state is more east coast, more mid-Atlantic.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Why do I emphasize that: because western Pennsylvania and its political proclivities are more like Wisconsin and Michigan, both also very important to the Harris Electoral College map.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And there are counties around Allegheny County that Trump carried.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There are three counties right around that that Trump carried 60-40.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Harris unveiled a new policy aimed at helping black men.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris campaign is trying to address that as well.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"More than 230 doctors, nurses and health care professionals are calling on Trump to release his records.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Harris campaign is trying to make that overall health, fitness, mental acuity argument a subtext to this campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So Anthony, we just spoke with major about the push from the Harris campaign to court, particularly black male voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The first one is, does her campaign think she needs to get an even higher percentage of that: that we'll see.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And this is what I mean, look at Harris voters and what they say about the economy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, a lot of people say and feel they're still increasing, but Trump voters much more so.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But two thirds of Trump voters say that it is not.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"For Trump voters, a majority say they feel that efforts to promote gender equality have been going too far.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's a majority, but look at Harris voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Look, I want to see Kamala Harris deliver her vision for a future for all Americans, particularly for young Americans.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So I think Kamala Harris needs to deliver that message to the American people and deliver that message to young voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I'm super proud to cast my first ever ballot for President Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right now, inflation and prices are up, wages and savings are down under the disastrous policies of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so a vote for President Trump is a vote for affordability, prosperity, and the American dream for my generation.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Ryan, what do you think they need to hear on Tuesday, that undecided voter: i think they need to hear, at least from President Trump, how he's going to turn the economy around.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"How is President Trump going to deliver: and I think if he articulates his message well, he stays on point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's abortion bans are going into implementation state after state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now, with former President Donald Trump found guilty of 34 felony counts, how will his unprecedented criminal conviction affect the upcoming election: well, from one end of the state to the other, KDK and our sister station CBS News Philadelphia are teaming up today to listen to you and take the pulse of Pennsylvania voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, from my perspective, it seemed like he's hands on with a lot of things.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's going to be a huge factor, whether you're a Trump supporter, whether you're a Biden supporter, and specifically, as we talked about, for those undetermined voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"President Kamala Harris, i do want to say because I know she's listening backstage.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So folks together we will propel great cities like Pittsburgh into the future with safer healthier and more resilient water infrastructure and President Biden and Vice President Harris are investing in America and making this reality this vision a reality.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It is my humble pleasure to introduce our amazing vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yo, so we're here live in Butler, PA at the Trump rally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump has returned to the place where someone nearly took his life.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This matters more than anything right now, the stakes of this election with the statement being made by Donald Trump, I felt like I had to be here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And what would you hope to take away from this whole situation after the rally is all said and done: well, I think the reason Trump is here is show strength, that he will not be chased away.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The attacks will not stop him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I've had people criticize Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They need to know that he's okay.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I'm like, so is it not honorable for Donald Trump to stand up after someone trying to take his life, raise his fist and let all of his supporters know that he is leading the charge, is the danger any different when a king would rush straight into a bunch of men with spears: so maybe you can criticize Donald Trump for that and say he's dumb, but there's a big difference between someone who's willing to sacrifice and someone who is stupid.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump knew the dangers and standing up was to send a message to the world.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He won't back down and coming back here is very similar, is that what motivates you to come back here: because some people think the people, the rally goers, the attendees, the guests are crazy for showing up to a place where somebody tried to kill another person.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Is he an individual that motivates you to keep going, like what's that fire, what keeps you up at night: you know, I've never been the biggest fan of Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump was just a good president and he's the best president of my lifetime.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And the bar was really low, but I like Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think he's a good guy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think he's got character defects.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's the right guy for the job.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm very excited for 2028, but when Trump says, I'm going to come back to the place where I took a bullet, nearly died, that is a powerful statement.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So if there's an individual that is on the fence and they don't know who to vote for because they've been listening to the internet and online and seeing joy, happiness, vibes, all that type of stuff, what would you tell them to sway them to vote for the right person: i told my buddy, he said, I'll never vote for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I said, do you like RFK Jr.: and he goes, yeah, I love him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I said, RFK Jr. says that if Donald Trump wins, he wins.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But a vote for Kamala Harris, what's her party bringing you, dick Cheney and Liz Cheney: come on.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And now they're saying Trump is the worst, but Trump has surrounded himself by really good people today.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So please, if you don't like Donald Trump, totally get it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We all see what's going on, he tried to die in office They have no shame Let's get them through this election Let's get rid of this trump era once and for all the right way Not by assassins bullets, but let's get rid of trump the right way And then we get that progressive movement pushing harder and harder Okay But the line that i'm pushing for y'all Is Gretchen Whitmer governor of michigan who will instantly take michigan, who will drive out the white women in pennsylvania: in this philly in pennsylvania and philly suburbs pittsburgh suburbs.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's following the Trump campaign this morning for us.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So Libby, let's talk about Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And we do hear him walk on that message a little bit sometimes.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Can you tell me about that, what the campaign is saying this morning about what the former president was signaling: trump was a town hall in Oaks, Pennsylvania last night.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But the Trump campaign is calling it, quote, a love fest.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Maybe Harris Faulkner, the Fox News moderator, will keep it more on message.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But last night, definitely more bizarre Trump event that we've seen this election cycle.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I wonder if the Trump campaign has responded to the vice president's use of his own words at her rallies to rally voters to her cause.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Vice President Kamala Harris is saying, listen to the former president's words, let them speak for himself.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He talks about Nancy Pelosi and Harris herself.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They think that he can dig his own hole, if you will.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He'll be watching and trying to make sure that there's no efforts to overturn the election again.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris is underperforming with them.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is also underperforming against minority voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But it seems that that post-debate bump that a lot of analysts expected that she would have is pretty much gone now.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If you will recall, Donald Trump won all the electoral votes in Pennsylvania in the 2016 US presidential elections by a margin of 0.72 percent.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"2020, Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now I should mention, Donald Trump recently posted on Truth Social.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He just did the other day on the Team Trump Facebook page.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The vice president heading to a couple areas of Pennsylvania that Trump won in 2020.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think it's because people see that she's offering a positive vision for the country and rejecting the chaos and division of Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Ian, Trump has been leaning into that baseless conspiracy theory about migrants eating pets.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She talked about her plans to take on grocery pricing and housing pricing and bring those down for the American people.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She talked about reproductive freedom and how she wants to protect it and sign a law that codifies Roe v. Wade.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Those are the things that voters actually care about, and Donald Trump is ranting about conspiracy theories that don't make any sense and that people are actually laughing at when he says them.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When you talk about trying to expand who she's reaching, we have heard from some undecided voters that we've talked to that even after the debate, they still don't know enough about the vice president's plans for the future and how her vision is different from President Biden's.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And she's offering her own set of proposals and vision for the country.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And what the next 50 some odd days will do is allow her to get out on the campaign trail and share those priorities directly with the American people.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And when the vice president talks about her history as a prosecutor, for example, and who she was fighting to protect and who she was defending, taking on the big banks to get 20 billion dollars for homeowners who got screwed during the during the financial crisis, you know, taking on gangs who were smuggling people and drugs across the border.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That is her history and record that she brings to her values that she would prioritize on policy as president.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I have to, i wasn't happy with Biden-Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We might, but I still want to see more about Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris won, as far as I'm concerned.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She was direct, she was concise.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She had more talking points ready.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She talked around it, and I want a more direct answer.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I like how she brought up multiple things that she wanted to do for policy, and people keep saying, I don't know why she doesn't want to talk about policy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's an M. Wickel.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I'm so cheer-girl, i'm here for the 21 months.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He would not vote for Trump a third time.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Democrats who urged Biden to exit race say Harris is exceeding expectations.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Democrats who urged Biden to exit race say Harris is beyond expectations.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"At a fragile moment with Democrats frustrated and fearful about the President's reelection prospects, Ryan posted on social media that Harris has significantly grown into her job.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We told you Harris was a better option.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I bet he's so unbearably smug right now deserves to be.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, i mean, every single Congress person, I think, who spoke up and vouched for her early on, they're allowed to be smug.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Our top story tonight involves Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has made waves with his latest remarks on Vice President Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris has recently faced criticism for her limited media presence since taking over from President Biden as the Democratic candidate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The image, which went viral on Wednesday, shows eight of his relatives wearing Walz's for Trump t-shirts, signaling their support for Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It took more than six weeks for Harris and Walz to sit down for their first official interview, which aired as a pre-taped segment with CNN's Dana Bash on Thursday.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The interview has sparked controversy, with some commentators questioning why Vice President Harris needed Governor Walz by her side for the occasion.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"To date, Harris has yet to hold a formal press conference, raising further concerns about transparency and accessibility as the campaign heats up.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Our top story tonight involves a tense exchange at the White House earlier today, where White House correspondent Peter Ducey questioned press secretary Kareen Jean-Pierre about Vice President Kamala Harris's shifting policy positions.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Ducey pressed Jean-Pierre on why Harris has changed several stances since her time as a U.S. senator and during the 2020 presidential race, despite Harris recently stating that her values have not changed.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her positions on key issues, such as health care for illegal immigrants, fracking and policing have evolved over time, leading to questions about her consistency as she prepares for the upcoming election season.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi, a Trump appointee, has restricted what the jury will hear about the personal tragedies that contributed to Biden's addiction, including the deaths of his brother and mother.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"His defense team sought to limit such details, arguing they amount to character assassination, but the judge has promised to control the introduction of salacious evidence.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And here she says to him, do you want to, you want us to play your songs: you said you wanted to hear your songs.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here, Donald Trump told people to go out and vote on January 5th.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He said, he said January 5th.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then Donald Trump tells Kristi Noem who killed her dogs that you know a lot about guns.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And then Donald Trump's like, all right, let's play the song.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then he just stands there for like minutes listening to these songs.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he like just kind of bobs.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm just going to show you small portions of it because this goes on for minutes as he's bobbing around and these songs are playing here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Nice and loud, god bless you, let's send President Trump back to the White House.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Then he talks about, he says he knows guns, but just listen to what he's saying.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then someone has a medical event at the event and Donald Trump says the individual should lose weight.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here's the individual, by the way, who Donald Trump yells at and tells to lose weight as he's being stretchered out of the rally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's what the individual looks like, here's what Donald Trump says.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is a good person.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You know, then Donald Trump spreads more lies about Springfield, Ohio.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he says that the migrants who are there lawfully are actually illegal immigrants, spreading more racism and xenophobia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump then tries to talk about gas and cooking.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I don't even know what he's even saying here because, again, he's really mentally having real issues.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then Donald Trump takes the mic again.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He says he's going to take another question, then changes his mind and then calls Democrats evil.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He then tells his production crew to play the YMCA and then starts dancing to the YMCA.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Just you can clip it where he starts talking about where he starts dancing, but just show a small portion of it because he then just dances to the whole YMCA song and then takes more questions and then starts dancing to those other songs.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris made it very clear on this.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's ready, she has been making this clear for a long time.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Donald Trump said that he would release his numbers.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He would release his his medical records.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look, he says now, I think he forgot to do it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's been forgetting things.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We'll give him a break on this.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Kamala Harris is right on this.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Watch his rallies, he's confused.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's a nearly 80 year old man.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's ranting and rambling until people get bored and leave his rallies.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He went on there and he suggested that he is going to send the military against the enemy from within.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's talking about you.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's talking about someone who comes to a rally to express their love and their commitment to our democracy.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump sees that as an enemy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So look, if anybody wants to pretend that this is a normal conversation that Donald Trump is having, just dispel that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, said, no one has ever been more dangerous to this country than Donald Trump, and he is a fascist to his core.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's exactly who he is, but here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And we can do that by making Kamala Harris the president of the United States.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Here, play this clip, and so after all these years, we know who Donald Trump is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He is someone who will stop at nothing to claim power for himself.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Listen to his words, he tells us who he is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he tells us what he would do if he is elected president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So here tonight, I will show you one example of Donald Trump's worldview and intentions.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He has worked to prevent women from making their own health care decisions and threaten your fundamental freedoms and rights.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Hey guys welcome back to another video today we will be talking about the state of Pennsylvania in the 2024 presidential race and now it really is going more and more towards Kamala Harris as the election approaches it's now only 24 days away she is simply running away with the state of Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It wasn't by a huge margin and it was close, but he did win.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think that he wins on a tie.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That was because they did an interior poll and they found that the majority of the people within the union endorsed Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So they said, well, we can endorse Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So that would be a bad look, the Democrats will pull funding, but we can't really endorse Harris because then we've pissed off more than half of our workers that we represent and they might pick it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So they decided to stand down and stand by, so to speak, i think that Pennsylvania is Trump's to lose.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If the trajectory of the race though remains roughly stable, I would expect Trump to win Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And this, by the way, is terrible news for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She goes to the border, as literal borders are, and doesn't really want to take questions from journalists, of course, about this.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And basically just sloganeers the entire time, trump has put forth concrete plans for what he wants to do.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Even for her, though, it seems odd that more than half of her actual policy positions are literally borrowed from her opponent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It'll go over so well, i mean, I'm looking at the political situation, they're like, what the fuck is going on at this point: and I think that Trump wins.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I can't imagine the American people are dumb enough to vote for Kamala Harris, by and large, number one.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump will conduct diplomacy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's getting roundly criticized by the liberals for doing so as well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's like Trump says, hey, I want to get a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If you're getting squeezed by prescription drug prices, Kamala Harris is going to take on Big Pharma.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You know, we have said all along that this decision was a deeply personal decision that Vice President Harris was going to have to make.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And she's chosen the person that she believes can help her win this election and that she believes can help her best govern.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We're fortunate to have Kamala Harris as our nominee and our next president.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There have also been some reports that your predecessor, former lieutenant governor and now Senator John Federman expressed concerns about Governor Shapiro to the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Clearly, the voters here in Pennsylvania didn't share those concerns when they elected Josh Shapiro in a landslide as our governor.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Clearly, they don't share those concerns today.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But how confident are you that Vice President Harris and Tim Waltz can win Pennsylvania in November: you know, I think as Democrats, we have a job to do to get out all across Pennsylvania to talk about our vision for this country, how we're going to create an economy that works for everyone, how we are going to make our community safer and how we're going to create ladders of opportunity for everyone.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris has fought at every turn to move America forward.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump at every turn has fought to take us backwards, to strip us of our fundamental rights and freedoms.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I think at the end of the day, people are going to understand that contrast and they're going to vote to make Kamala Harris our next president.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And I know, that sounds crazy, like, wait, what: according to some people, Kamala Harris is up by 15 points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is coming from someone that covers the Harris campaign for NBC News.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Maybe she's wrong, like, maybe this is just misinformation, whatever.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Look at this, on the RCP average right now, Trump is up by two points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's with Bloomberg having their garbage polls, which by the way, they had a Trump plus four.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They had a Trump plus four.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's up by around two to three points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And apparently the internals have Trump up by around two to five points in Pennsylvania as of now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It could, but as of now, the public polling is showing a Trump plus two lead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But now it's still a Trump lead.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And not only that, Trump's at 48%, except for one poll, he's at 48, 49, and 50% of the vote.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, so he's already about to crack 50%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So let's just say, okay, Minnesota, Virginia, Harris wins those states, New Hampshire, Maine, whatever.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Okay, let's say Trump carries Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he's the next president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now it's really, if Trump carries one state, just one, even Nevada, he would be at 270.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's why it's such a big deal if Pennsylvania goes towards Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's why I think the Harris campaign, they're kind of freaking out because if Josh Shapiro wasn't enough to save them, how are you going to win, how are you supposed to win Pennsylvania: if not, even Josh Shapiro would be enough to win the presidency.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But after that, she cannot lose a single state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, does this mean Trump's going to win Pennsylvania by 10 points: no.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This should be when her polling's at her and it's absolute peak.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So she's already down by two to three points and this is when she should be pulling her best.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So really at this point, Harris cannot lose any more states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I really don't know what the Harris campaign does if they lose Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If she just gives up in Pennsylvania, which I don't think she will, but if she's losing Pennsylvania by two to three points as of now and even Josh Shapiro wouldn't have saved them.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Does anyone really expect her to win: i don't know.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I guess it's possible that maybe she wins every other state except Pennsylvania, but I don't see that occurring.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, he's probably the clear favorite at that point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It actually is giving Trump just as many votes as Philadelphia is in excess giving the votes for whoever the Democratic candidate is.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now the most recent New York Times, Siena poll shows Kamala Harris at 43% of the vote in the Northeast part of the state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So that means less voters for Donald Trump, more voters overall, that's going to add to the overall number.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, if you take Fayette County, which I mentioned earlier, talking in comparison to Philadelphia County, you actually have a 10% decrease in the amount of voters voting there, yet the numbers have gone up 13% for Donald Trump during this time.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So that is a good thing as well, and with the latest poll numbers that we see out of Northeast Pennsylvania, if Kamala Harris is able to get over 40 percent, chances are they're going to win the state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's done, kamala Harris wins.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Whereas Trump almost kind of invites it on himself where he does so many.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And J.D, vance has been on TV constantly, and he does a lot of press conferences as well that it's a kind of double edged sword to caramelize not giving herself the opportunity to make mistakes, but at the same time, it kind of cuts off access to who she is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if you take into reporting from our own Selena Zito, who basically kind of crisscrosses Pennsylvania the whole time, feels to be that there there's Kamala still got a lot of work to do there if she's going to win it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And I would imagine as well, there's still a certain resentment that they turfed out one of their own to replace and replace her on the ticket.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Do we see Donald Trump investing time and campaign money in Pennsylvania in a way that shows his campaign kind of gets how important Pennsylvania is, i mean, do you see a strategy to the way he's campaigning: yeah, it's interesting.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He had Long Island.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And, you know, I was thinking, why is he kind of going after New York: because it's a blue state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I sort of understand the crypto bit of it because he's obviously made a play for that that industry.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But I would have thought that Trump would want to purely focus on these crucial swing states.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, he's obviously been in Pennsylvania a lot and Trump is somewhat kind of omnipresent and he's never off your TV.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's never not posting on on a truth social.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Maybe, but yeah, there just seemed to be a kind of strange lack of focus from his campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And for his sake, hopefully it doesn't cost him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, whereas you mentioned Donald Trump's kind of scattershot right now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he were to get on message and start campaigning where he needs to, he has some opportunities for growth.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But she's run a fairly flawless campaign so far and still isn't budging.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, where is her opportunity to rise: well, it's a great question.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I don't know if she does have many more opportunities, if any.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I think when you say she's run a flawless campaign, it's because it's mistake free one, I guess, is a better way.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, it's mistake free, but it's because she's not giving those opportunities to go mistake free.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's given hardly any interviews thus far.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's she can very rarely.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I don't think she's done a press conference as far as I can recall.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And J.D, vance has been on TV constantly and he does a lot of press conferences as well.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That it's a kind of double edged sword to caramelize not giving herself the opportunity to make mistakes, but at the same time, it kind of cuts off access to who she is.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So I don't know if Kamala really kind of has many more opportunities.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They don't seem to want to do another debate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She certainly has shown no indication that she's going to go on a freewill interview spree.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So the fact that somebody said even recently, like I guess Kamala changed her opinion about fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Former President Trump also in Pennsylvania last night making his pitch to voters at a town hall event that took an unusual turn Senior national correspondent tremor and has the details.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Good morning, Terry Good morning, George Donald Trump came here to the suburbs of Philadelphia one of the critical battlegrounds in this battleground state looking for votes But as you say that town hall event that he held quickly turned into something very different when the candidate turned into a DJ a overnight Donald Trump in his 11th trip to must win, Pennsylvania Urged his supporters to turn out on election day.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
How about this: we'll play YMCA Trump kept DJing and most of his supporters stayed for another 30 minutes of his place People Inside the hall seemed to like it very much at the end Trump did something he rarely does he came down off the stage and Mangled with the crowd shaking hands and chatting with people.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Specifically, we're looking at Kamala Harris's chances, and one state that has everyone on edge, Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Really: yeah, like there's this underlying sense that this lack of engagement with local leaders, it's a pattern for the Harris campaign, not just limited to Philadelphia.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So they're stepping on toes all over the state.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And it's not like they don't have strong allies in Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Like some Democrats are wondering why she hasn't been used more effectively as a surrogate for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, and she's someone who could really energize voters, get them excited about Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And is the Harris campaign doing that: well, based on this article, there are definitely some doubts.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This razor-thin margin demonstrates that Pennsylvania is highly competitive, and Trump remains a formidable challenger capable of gaining ground.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This poll shows a closer race, indicating that Trump is capable of gaining more support among registered voters as the election date nears.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This shift in Trump's favor reflects his ability to rally voters and gain momentum, indicating that Pennsylvania remains a battleground state where Trump is making strong inroads.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This close result demonstrates that Trump is in a strong position heading into the final stretch of the campaign, with Pennsylvania shaping up to be a critical battleground.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
A president show Biden and former president Donald Trump will battle it out at the ballot box in Pennsylvania in just a few days as voters head to the polls on Tuesday for the commonwealth's primary.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Both candidates made campaign stops in the keystone state in recent days with Trump swinging by bucks at Lehigh counties and President Biden making a three-day push through PA with stops in Scranton, Philadelphia and in Pittsburgh.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"According to the Cook Political Report, Pennsylvania is one of six toss-up states in the 2024 election and in 2020, Biden, as you know, won PA and in 2016, Trump turned the state red, pulling off a win against Hillary Clinton.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
President Donald Trump worked at a Pennsylvania McDonald's.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And today we got to talk about president Donald Trump working a shift at a Pennsylvania McDonald's.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The optics look great, he was great.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's a billionaire, big, uh, real estate tycoon, whatever, but he's still to us, one of us.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, and my humble opinion, those who did not like this didn't like Trump already.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So it didn't matter what he did.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look, if Trump was to volunteer to rescue puppies, okay, puppies and kittens he's rescuing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Oh, she's great, and she's an amazing cook and should bring it to the white house.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, whoever that is talking, you already know it's just somebody that didn't like Trump already.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It doesn't matter what Trump did.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like I said, he could volunteer to rescue puppies and kittens and they would still try to find a way to say he did something wrong.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He could be out there picking up litter trash.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It don't matter, they would say he did something wrong.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The New York times as Trump served up McDonald's fries, vitriol boiled outside.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, so talking about all you Trump supporters are being negative and violent.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Uh, Newsweek, McDonald's, Donald Trump worked at failed last health inspection.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There are reports suggesting Trump worked at him at Donald's, but that's not quite right because there's differences between work and stage theatrics.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's the best from Fox, now, you know, we dealing with, we talking about the mainstream media being very bad.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, now here's a Kamala let her cook.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
You see what they do.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You see what they do flipping burgers, but Hey, it's cool because you know, Kamala, that's mamala.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is locking down food network voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her love of cooking and dreams of opening a restaurant are relatable to America's foodies.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Thank you, i want to take a look at the Trump store.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is relatable because what do we say: okay.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, so he comes to you from the common sense perspective and then he comes to you from the business perspective and real people can recognize that we see what's going on.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We see how Trump is different from your regular political person who was just an actor at best and not even a good actor.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Don't be a good guy, he doesn't.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's a great guy, how many McDonald's you own, hey, you know what: i'm looking at Trump and what he has on the red tie with the white shirt and the, and the yellow, like the golden arts to this type situation.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I.P, to Dave Thomas, trump could be a new Dave Thomas.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump serving fries through the drive-thru to the reporters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, president Trump, thank you, hello everybody.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, and we got a picture of Trump out the window waving.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then this iconic picture of the staff leaving when Trump won hilarious.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Hello, everybody, you can take this, right: this is compliments of Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"President Trump, especially work more days at McDonald's and Kamala.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If it's a cheap stunt, then you got a picture of Kamala literally flipping burgers.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump is set to hold a major rally with GOP candidates tomorrow night.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He has peddled former President Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 election.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We know that he is endorsed by former President Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Back to Trump for a second, rachel, he's traveling to the state on Saturday for a rally with those top Republican candidates.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Back to my previous point, there's such a thing as a good resignation, right: she knew when she pulled out earlier.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It was a good idea, right: it kind of worked out well for her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"When Kamala was Vice President, she got a 28% approval rate, which is lower than, I think it was Mike Pence, lower than Dick Cheney, and lower than Biden.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's got the lowest ever polling for things like that.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And then what, five minutes ago all of a sudden: even this vote was even the Vice President she polled for.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She got the lowest ever on record.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She brings joy to this.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She has this, and then they talk about the Vice President nominee, J.D. Vance, as weird, and every title is weird.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They want us to believe she's popular.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But now that Kamala is there, everything she's done has been really well scripted.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's been really slick and polished, she hasn't had to face an election debate yet.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's going to have to do all the press conference, which she has refused to do.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They said that last week, sometime, now listen, I don't catch everything that Biden says, but they said that Biden mentioned that Trump had a bull's eye on him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So listen, just to give you some background, if you don't know anything about it and what's going on, Trump was injured at a shooting at Pennsylvania rally that left at least one person unalived.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So he injured, he critically injured two other people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He shot at Trump and I believe the teleprompter glass is what ricocheted and cut him on the air.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, okay, so see his one story that said that it was a teleprompter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And you know, this whole talk about project 2025 and they're just trying to attach that to Trump and they're saying that that has nothing to do with Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Listen, I don't really, I'm not on the side of Joe Biden, not on the side of Trump either, right, to be honest with you, I understand that politics get a lot of people enraged, but I don't think anybody deserves to lose their life at all, right: so President Joe Biden spoke with Trump after the situation.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So and Trump is planning to still attend per his advisors.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So those around Trump said that he has long feared the attempt on his life.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So yeah, so that happened, i also wanted to take a moment out and read the statement that Trump made on Twitter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I understand that you don't like Trump, but I seen people even making comments talking about they wish that it got done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I don't wish death on anybody at all, right: and it was crazy that they had a video with the 50 cent and they was showing Trump walking through and like, many men wish death upon me.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I know that people don't like Trump, but I don't have any hatred for him at all.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala, donald Trump then wants the crowd to know he is not cognitively impaired.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So he wants to share the story of Hannibal Lecter again here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Play the clip, this is oh, they go crazy when they want to try and say he's cognitively impaired.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But when I say Hannibal Lecter, they say, why does he keep mentioning it, because Hannibal Lecter was a serious psycho, right: he was the Silence of the Lands.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's great, he's a Trump voter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I don't think we have to worry about him, do we: he's a Trump voter all the way.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Then in a very weird and creepy moment, Donald Trump talks about Corey Competore's wife, Corey Competore, was killed in Butler, Pennsylvania in the shooting, and Donald Trump is surprised that Corey Competore's widow says that she like still loves him and would still want to be with him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump says many wives would not want to be with them.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Ergo, she's tough on crime.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Play the clip, she wasn't tough on crime.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Then Donald Trump says he doesn't know much about shootings or, you know, he says people like him when it comes to the Second Amendment, but he doesn't know a lot about that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But what he does know about his golf, he says, play the clip.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He said that's like sinking a two-foot putt, dad.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That would be the equivalent, is that right: he actually said it might be less than that because some people can't sink a two-foot putt like Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's a great guy, great young athlete.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala is the new fighter.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He then calls the leader of the Senate, Democrat Chuck Schumer, a Palestinian and someone who's with Hamas.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's how Donald Trump labels Chuck Schumer.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Pretty pathetic stuff there, then Donald Trump just rambles on about telling rich people that made some he doesn't like, that they want him to take over telephone companies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He then says the reason that he loses is because Democrats cheat, play the clip.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He then asks the crowd if they like red meat.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He says it's like 107,000 people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then Donald Trump praises the crowd size on January 6th.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's horrible, it's insurrection.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, trump then talks about how he's been accused of throwing hamburgers on the wall.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's all there publicly, but Donald Trump's gonna, Donald Trump, meaning he's just gonna go out there and lie.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're trying to delete everything she said.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He then attacks President Biden for calling Pennsylvania a state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then Donald Trump shortly thereafter calls Pennsylvania a state instead of a commonwealth.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He would call it a state often.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Alina Habba was the person who spoke before Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And this is par for the course for Alina Habba and Trump surrogates.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And this is the first time that I've ever seen a Trump surrogates.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Donald Trump, if you look at the Venn diagram, is both a rapist and a fraudster.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
One of Donald Trump's top surrogates also posted the following.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So when we say they're weird, this is the kind of stuff that we're talking about.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He also has a Fulton County mugshot, ""'his own sneaker line and three baby mamas. ""'",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Go and vote, former President Donald Trump at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks last night for a town hall, he took questions from the crowd for about 90 minutes with South Carolina's Senator Kristi Noem serving as moderator.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Trump campaign estimated 5 to 6000 people were here for this event.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump stopped taking questions during those times requesting Ave Maria be played the first time an instrumental version came on.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And during the second emergency, Trump specified he actually meant Pavarotti's version, so that came on.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She rallied voters in Erie, telling the crowd the region is one of the most influential in presidential elections with the vote in Erie County, often predicting the national result.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris also touched on some hot topics of this year's race like abortion.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I know Kamala Harris can be that president for the entire nation and certainly for the good people of Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
There's polling that showed today Kamala Harris up by a point.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And I love Philly and Pittsburgh, but they went to rural Beaver County.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I want to just get your reaction to something that Donald Trump says a lot about Jewish Americans.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He warns that Israel will no longer exist if Vice President Kamala Harris becomes president.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Look, I think it is more of the same from Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I have been the recipient of many attacks from Donald Trump, including anti-Semitic attacks from Donald Trump over the years, as have the people of Pennsylvania and the American people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is someone who peddles bigotry and hatred.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump sort of fails that test that parents set for their kids.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And one of the things you had to do was go into court and basically preserve the kind of integrity of the state's election system underneath the sort of fuselage of lawsuits from the Trump campaign and others.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Unfortunately, we are already beginning to see the lawsuits and the threats of lawsuits come from Donald Trump and his allies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's been a lot of activity here today, but we're outside the fairgrounds where Donald Trump will be speaking tomorrow night, the same exact location that he was speaking about three months ago when those shots rang out.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We want to turn now to Vice President Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So Nancy, we've learned that former President Barack Obama is expected to soon hit the campaign trail for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And then he'll just go from there, he's not going to be appearing with Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He is beloved, he may even have some supporters who feel more strongly about him than they do about Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Anyone who doesn't have a big race of their own and is a boldface name of the following, whether it is Bernie Sanders, whether it's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, they're all hitting the campaign trail right now on behalf of Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He said, well, we've got to look at everything.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, that's good, here's Harris answering questions to the press and this is a market change.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But here is Harris with a decidedly different rhetorical approach to this age old question that we get from the Beltway Press.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But to see Harris basically, I'm not going to take the bait.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What we saw was a small Harris lead, but within the margin of error becoming a race that is way, way, way too close to call at this particular point.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This is with the betting favorites, but with Kamala Harris taking the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania over here, what do we see: we see that Kamala Harris wins in this particular case.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Again, with the betting favorites with Trump taking Pennsylvania, what happens when we turn Pennsylvania red: well, take a look here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, if it is in fact the tipping point state, is there any elected official in Pennsylvania who may have been on a ticket that might have made a difference, well, this was the great question when Kamala Harris was making her VP selection, who should she select: and of course, folks like myself thought that she should take Josh Shapiro, of course as the governor of the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Could she have been a winner if she had chosen him instead of Tim Walts: we don't know the answer to that question.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Voters continue to say that they want to know more about Kamala Harris's policy positions.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The Harris campaign has added an issues tab on the campaign website, but I wonder what you think about this perception from voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, first of all, I think we basically know what a Kamala Harris presidency would focus on because there is kind of a communal bottom-up agenda from the Democratic Party really at all levels.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We have four years of Biden and can compare that to four years of Trump and voters can render their judgment based on that.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And there's also been some analysis on the swing states that are the most ethnically diverse are the ones more likely to favor Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I would still be pretty surprised if New York city or New York state goes for Trump, but he is making big inroads.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump will be the next president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's ahead comfortably there, so a lot can happen and a lot can be wrong with polls.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Christian, talk to us about what the world might look like if Trump is successful.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, it's on fire during the Biden administration, but Trump says he'll fix Ukraine.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What will the world look like foreign policy wise if he gets up: right.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he has the benefit of being a challenger where you don't actually have to go into intricate detail.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump gave, I think, the benefit of the doubt to China.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So I think you'd see a second Trump term without as much chaos and without as much groping for what America first policy really means.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Trump does want to negotiate with Russia, which for some reason is controversial here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"First up, let's talk about Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's been hitting the ground hard, especially focusing on black men voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris has been outlining her opportunity agenda, which includes key issues like abortion rights.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's really emphasizing how critical this issue is, aiming to sway voters who might be on the fence.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris is pushing hard on this front, but she's facing some challenges too.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Added Chapter Harris is also focusing on economic policies, aiming to boost job creation and support small businesses.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She believes that by strengthening the economy, she can win over undecided voters who are concerned about their financial future.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Additionally, Harris is making a strong push to connect with younger voters, emphasizing the importance of education and student loan forgiveness.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"On the other hand, Trump is doubling down on his promise to bring back manufacturing jobs to Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's focusing on trade policies that he claims will benefit American workers and revitalize the industrial sector.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is also making a concerted effort to appeal to veterans, promising better health care and support for those who have served.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And we know Trump is about, look, he's a great here going through this, he's doing it because he l and I love the fact that h that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yes, So we're here live in But PA at the Trump rally, his an appearance here in But it very easy for you.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Rain or shine, they showed up for President Trump tonight in Western Pennsylvania and it was pouring rain.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
President Trump wants to give a boost to another primary candidate.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's endorsed Dr. Mehmet Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You know him as Dr. Oz from TV.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's running for Senate in Pennsylvania and hopes to ride that Trump wave to victory on May 17th, just as J.D. Vance did in Ohio this past Tuesday.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's from his campaign website you can see.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, and so much of that, at least for Trump and Trump supporters, depending on the state, is how much you'll buy into the 2020 was rigged and President Trump actually won and it was stolen from him, something that Democrats just love getting Republican primary candidates to say so they can run against it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She sort of stepped up.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She had a really sort of burst of momentum, you know, through her coalescing that support through the DNC, the Democratic National Convention, where she officially took officially became the nominee through the debate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, she's clearly trying to do something to shake the race up.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And when you take a look, Donald Trump against Joe Biden in a rematch looked like it was on track for a very solid victory, 4.5% victory in Pennsylvania would practically have assured Donald Trump would have won this election against President Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Pennsylvania alongside many other battleground states has seen quite significant shifts in favor of the Democratic contender now, Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And now that she has Governor Tim Walsom in the ticket, we have yet to see any Pennsylvania polls yet, but I do imagine that will offer a bump to Kamala Harris, even if marginal, any bump will help her, given that now in the most recent polls, she's either leading or tied in this state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so Pennsylvania now turning into a state where Kamala Harris is either up, or according to this Republican pollster, I think that is the most really impactful part of this all, is that Republican pollsters and polls sponsored by the GOP typically come back with more favorable results.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I also believe that to be true, my video this morning I said, I believe Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will win this state by one to two points, but right now, a four point margin isn't far out from where it's closer to be.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But looking at the general election matchup, Kamala Harris now takes the lead.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's up 0.6% of the five way.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Practically every recent poll here, besides Harvard Harris and Russ Musken, show Kamala Harris leading.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so I think Kamala Harris really narrowing down this state too, also has now been translated to some of the political betting market odds.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But so Kamala Harris is now rising, rising, rising, whereas she also rising is the state of Pennsylvania relative to where President Biden was.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And so Kamala Harris now narrowing down even pre-VP selection in Pennsylvania goes to show that Democrats are in a far better position.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Even the Emerson poll, we can see here, has Trump up by two, which was a very good poll for Trump just right after the announcement.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The poll taken right before the announcement had Trump up by five.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, against Biden, Trump led by 2.9%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The only poll after she became the nominee has her up by two.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And remember that Bloomberg Morning Consult number, because they did Trump versus Biden numbers.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And what did they find: the Trump led by five.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris make major improvements relative to President Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She has the opportunity to take this VP selection, which Democrats, Republicans alike seem to really like him.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"We found out that under the Donald Trump administration, Tim Walz was actually appointed to this round table of governors who advised the president.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He came from a purple district, a Trump district.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"A month and a half ago, Kamala Harris was not the presidential nominee.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But Kamala Harris as the opposition to Joe Biden, not opposition, but the alternative to Joe Biden does far better.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Why: because voters weren't sold on Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that helped Trump because his enthusiasm numbers were through the roof compared to Biden.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Some swing voters who aren't happy with the fact that Biden is the nominee may also just not be voting for Trump, but may just be saying I'm undecided.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
All these different answers that may have been Biden voters from 2020 that are now coming back home with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now coming to an abrupt halt because Joe Biden dropped out of the race, Donald Trump Republicans must be really angry because this is a very difficult position for them to navigate.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They spent an entire convention railing against President Biden only for the day after the convention ends for Joe Biden to drop out of the race.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Very interesting circumstances, very good news for the Democratic Party that they're doing quite well with Kamala Harris, Pennsylvania now expanding and included on that map of states that are now on the radar to be even more in the advanced column for the Democratic Party, especially with Governor Tim Walz on this ticket.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"After all these years, we know who Donald Trump is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I've said for a while now, watch his rallies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So you heard his words.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump, donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He has worked to prevent women from making their own health care decisions and threaten your fundamental freedoms and rights like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's not being transparent with the voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's not being transparent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So check this out, he refuses to release his medical records.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He is unwilling to do a 60 minutes interview.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He is unwilling to meet for a second debate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The Journal's survey asked economists how Trump's proposed broad-based tariffs would affect domestic manufacturing employment of the 44 economists who responded.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Before her rally tonight, Vice President Harris visited a local black-owned small business for a conversation with black men from the Erie, Pennsylvania area after visiting with black farmers ahead of her remarks in North Carolina yesterday.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yep, for an $800,000 donation, you get to sit at Trump's table.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Dive into that world a little bit, yeah, bro, so today, we're about to react to Obama slayers Trump for hurricane misinformation at campaign rally in Pennsylvania for Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I love this, they be getting juicy though.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"President Biden and Vice President Harris were down there meeting with local officials and comforting families, asking how they could help.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They think, well, at least he's owning the libs.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I've noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior of bullying and of putting people down is a sign of strength.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It never has been, said, cut him in.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Vote for Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States, vote for Tim Wols as the next vice president of the United States, vote for Bob Casey and this whole incredible Pennsylvania Democratic ticket, help your friends and family members and neighbors and coworkers do the same.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's continuing her recent media blitz with a Univision town hall.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Trump traveled to Michigan.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Bob, I know you're in Pittsburgh because that is where former President Barack Obama is campaigning for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And they know that former President Trump has done well here in 2016 and 2020, especially in the Pittsburgh area in the ex urban in rural counties around Pittsburgh.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And there is a concern privately among some Democrats that Vice President Harris, her support among some some union members could be a little bit soft.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So this visit is about reviving the Obama coalition from the past and trying to get some political electricity around Vice President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Vice President Harris and her team say she is fully engaged as well.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Do they have the money to repair their homes, do they have the money to put food on the table: whether their lives are affected by a storm or not in both of these campaigns, whether it's Trump at the Economic Club in Detroit today, President Obama, the former president here in Pittsburgh today that the main contenders out on the field across the country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged and he is out for unchecked power.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"For example, if you look at what Kamala announced as a policy decision about doling out shops, about the one million unforgiven, small loans of twenty thousand dollars to the undeserved communities, she's trying to look at black men because the votes of the black men, because polls suggest that black men are drifting away from the Democrats.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris continued her campaign blitz, focusing on black male voters, with an interview on the radio show, The Breakfast Club.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her 11th trip, I understand, to the state since launching her campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Who specifically, which demographic is she trying to win over there: good morning, Earl.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Elon Musk donating nearly $75 million, I understand Jake, from his political action committee to support the Trump campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris is riding a big wave of momentum to the Democratic DNC there.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's no longer the case, right, so what will President Trump be doing during the DNC: yeah, so early on, it looks like he's going to be focusing on Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He is in Wilkes-Barre today and then York, Pennsylvania on Monday at the start of the DNC in Chicago.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so point being, it's a demonstration of one of the things that Democrats say they really wanted out of a Harris candidacy, which is someone who could inject a new sense of optimism and a new sense of momentum into this party.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And Perry, Trump has been taking some heat, of course, for comments that he made this week about the Presidential Medal of Freedom.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let's go ahead and take a listen to this, the highest award you can get is a civilian.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now, Perry, the Trump campaign is defending those remarks.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But as Trump has said, he is who he is, and this is how he's going to be talking to voters, Gio.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Welcome to our show, The Trump Briefing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He mocked her appearance, laugh, and debating skills while criticizing her economic proposals.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Despite his tangents and impressions of foreign leaders, Trump assured his supporters of his intelligence and focus.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The rally highlighted the political tension as Democrats prepared for their national convention, with Harris as their nominee, hoping to capitalize on her appeal to younger, liberal voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The police are preparing to manage the protests with strategies aimed at preventing violence, while Trump has condemned such demonstrations and hinted at a military response if elected.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He suggested that the Democrats' strategy of portraying Trump as, weird, could be effective, emphasizing the need to use irony and satire to highlight Trump's perceived absurdities.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania will also host the first Harris-Trump debate on September 10.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"As the Democratic National Convention approaches, Harris's upcoming speech is anticipated to further boost her campaign, setting the stage for a crucial period leading up to the presidential debate and the start of early voting.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The illustration reflects the confidence within Kamala Harris's party as they navigate the political landscape.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"With the Democratic National Convention on the horizon, Harris's anticipated speech is expected to solidify her position and energize the base.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She is also leading among key demographic groups, including women, young voters, and independents.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Harris's possible VP picks are also making their best case to be her running mate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The big question right now for Harris is will Shapiro help her clinch the Keystone state come November: like Harris, he is also a former attorney general.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But some of his policy stances could bring ire from within the party.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It was that last comment there from that Trump voter that has rung out a few times from other Trump voters here, even though they've said they're going to vote for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They liked his response to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If you don't know who they are outside of their state, sure, he could potentially help Harris win Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Where he could strengthen the ticket for Kamala Harris nationally is by trying to court the Jewish vote.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So not only could that again help them here, but it could help bring that voter base back to the left for Harris if Shapiro is on the ticket.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"John Delano, politics editor with CBS News Pittsburgh, spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris about the top issues for the Keystone State voters, including her stance on the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by the Japanese company Nippon Steel.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"How have the voters you've talked to reacted to because this is a part of Vice President Harris's economic message, how have they reacted more broadly to that message: well, John, first of all, it's always good to be with you.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's for the billionaires.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's trying to make the contrast.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So you get a feeling that she stands for something.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, I really think the people that are supporting Donald Trump had been with Donald Trump throughout.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You go to other parts and the Harris signs are up.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They don't feel they need them.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is where it's going to be won, and Donald Trump needs to cross 270 electoral votes to become president of the United States.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We have the Donald Trump mugshot design.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We got the Make America Gain Again tank top design.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Pennsylvania would win the election for Donald Trump, assuming he gets North Carolina and Georgia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But assuming that Donald Trump wins those states, Pennsylvania is the ball game.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And now Donald Trump has a lead.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is going to gain significantly out of the gate.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, it's true that with these white college graduate voters, Harris may make some gains by how much we could, you know, question that.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But still, it's very likely that Harris, she probably loses, you know, a little bit of ground with black voters, according to most polling.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It's very likely that the polls are overestimating Trump's support.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, you know, you could adjust for the turnout, but just doing that would give Donald Trump the victory.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Trump base is fired up.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, I think he could very well be up by a little bit more and it doesn't take into account potential swings in places like Philadelphia City proper, where it's the largest county in the state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And you will probably see a decent swing to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That really is, and it's possible the polls underestimating him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Harris is directly tethered to those policies.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They're unfamiliar with Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now it's a tie sometimes, depending on the day, Trump has a narrow lead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What role does Pennsylvania play in Kamala Harris' presidential campaign: pennsylvania is a critical battleground state in Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, and its importance cannot be overstated.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Campaign focus and strata, Harris has been making numerous trips to Pennsylvania, emphasizing a broader strategy that goes beyond traditional Democratic strongholds.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris has expanded her campaign efforts into these regions, including Beaver County, Lancaster County and Fayette County, to connect with voters who may not be as familiar with her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This targeted advertising aims to enhance Harris' personal narrative and economic policies.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Debate and public engagement, Harris prepared for the first presidential debate in Pittsburgh and has since engaged in various interviews and rallies across the state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"However, the Harris campaign believes its organization is stronger, with a broader reach into rural and swing counties.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And he might have some leverage here after he just appeared with Donald Trump and Mara Log on Friday, who, of course, has been against Ukraine aid.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Also, even if he can get to the House, the Senate probably not going to love this either.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, Akhila, an interesting dynamic here for President Trump, he was in the New York courthouse yesterday.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's going back today.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The president himself has made clear he doesn't want to talk about Trump's legal issues.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They do not want to specifically talk about any of Trump's legal woes.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think that's partly because Trump has tried to paint this as a politically motivated attack against them.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And yet Trump has really not been able to catch up when it comes to that ground game.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And it does feel like a bit of a pivotal moment here as we're finally seeing Trump tied to a courtroom day after day.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Vice President Harris has focused her campaign today on Pennsylvania, which is not much of a surprise, but her strategy is worth looking at.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There's two in Pennsylvania that went twice for Obama, then went for Trump, and then Biden got him back.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, it's our lucky day because our lead correspondent who covers the Harris campaign for us, she happens to be from Luzerne County.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But by the way, first, I want to talk to you about why Harris is there.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Anyway, Harris is going there today.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So what's at stake there, Luzerne County, for Harris and Trump: yeah.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It's Trump sign.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Next door, you could see Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And you know, they might be voting for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You see all the Trump signs.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is making clear that she gets how to win Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The week before the DNC, she came to Pennsylvania and she didn't go to Philly or Pittsburgh.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And there she came to talk about cutting costs.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She came to talk about economic challenges and what a Harris administration would do to improve their lives.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
One thing that that brings to mind is the fact that Kamala Harris and Tim will also are opening up field offices across the state.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's got some intensity behind his campaign.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"People who were likely going to vote for Joe Biden are now not only voting for Kamala Harris, but they're also taking lawn signs, putting them on their lawn.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That guy goes out and parrots Trump's bullshit every day.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And it's clear Donald Trump is having a whole lot of buyer's remorse.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, i mean, this is somebody who, for example, is, uh, is running on the ticket with somebody who he called America's Hitler.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is somebody who's doing apologia for, for a guy who, who is denying the biraciality of, of Kamala Harris while he himself has three biracial kids.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They had different healthcare policy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, he's not being honest with us.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's not being honest with himself.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's a total poser.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What does it say, um, about, about this ticket's working class appeal that even, even though he was endorsed by the leadership of the organization that he was speaking at, the rank and file were clearly hostile to his campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And we're Donald Trump can't hold a candle to what we are doing every day because he is just full of empty promises that have quite literally raised costs for the middle class and made it harder for them to get ahead.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Just recently, Donald Trump has come out and said that he's actually going to be a champion for IVF and he's actually expressed hostility toward the six-week abortion ban that his own policies facilitated.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What does it say about the state of this race that this is the tack that he's taking now: well, look, it's clearly where the vast majority of Americans are.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Remember, it was he who packed the Supreme Court so that they would overturn Roe v. Wade and it was he who ran to the microphones to claim credit for it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"OK, so Canada, Kamala Harris will be back in Pennsylvania for the second time this week.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Former President Donald Trump is holding a town hall with Latino voters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So they are they brought out families that were separated during the Trump administration, their border separation policy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's what her focus is on right now.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Obviously, as you know, the race in Pennsylvania raised her thin.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This is according to Bloomberg, shares of US Steel sliding for a second day as President Biden voicing opposition to that planned sale to Japan's Nippon Steel, while Donald Trump recently promised to block the takeover instantaneously.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Quinnipiac actually describes that as a head to head outcome because that three point margin that Donald Trump has is within their margin for error.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Again, Trump's trying to show some solidarity with union workers.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If Trump wins Pennsylvania, well, at that point in time, he just needs to win North Carolina and Georgia and he's at 270.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Whereas Harris, she could win every other state yet losing the scenario.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So for Trump to be up here, yeah, it's a big freaking deal.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he wins Pennsylvania by two to three points, for starters, he's not just barely winning the electoral college.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's probably winning Nevada.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There's no way he wins Pennsylvania by two to three.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he's really winning Pennsylvania by two to three points, which, by the way, he's up in Arizona, Georgia, but we'll just say he doesn't win either of those states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, if he is winning Pennsylvania by two to three points, he's winning Wisconsin and Michigan.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The statistical tie with Fox News, Sussacwon, Rasmussen, Mollenburg, Marist, et cetera, it's like, really: i find it very unlikely that every pollster, including ones like Mollenburg and Fox News, the fact they have the race tied just like Rasmussen and Sussacwon, even inside her advantage, she had the race Trump plus two.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They are Republican leading voters that more than likely they're going to break for Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're not going to break for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Surely there's other metrics out there that show Harris having a victory.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"OK, yeah, compared to 2020, even 2022, yeah, the problem is even NBC admitted that like over half of Harris's support, they're going to vote before Election Day.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Maybe he did, but either way, I would argue that Catholics are a must win group for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, the stuff that Harris said about the Knights of Columbus, for example, it is real bad.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The fact is that she said that crap about the Knights of Columbus is unbelievable.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But but the point is she she has no appeal to Catholic voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But if it's even just a 10 point shift towards Trump, he's got Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All the better, so good for walls, and good for Harris again, because like I sometimes I get a little, you know, I think we highlight walls because he's a wonderful communicator and like does a lot of the things that we wanted for the Democrats to do.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But sometimes I think he gets a little outsized attention because, you know, he's like the white guy that like a lot of people whatever think is a communicator of the issues that I don't know.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He is better at that stuff.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But you picked him for a reason and then like, well, but that's the point.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, he's actually, you know, like we have seen.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We've seen what he will sign.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We've seen what he won't sign.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So on some level, you know, he's not he is an avatar of what we.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And he had a career of doing that.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Which means, you know, I don't think she had the same like political rudder that Biden has now, you know, we were happy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, there's I'm just a little bothered by a lot of you know, she made these decisions, right: and it seems odd that like there hasn't been much credit for that assigned to her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Chris Stierwald's commentary offers an insightful breakdown of why Pennsylvania is a crucial battleground state, elucidating the factors that could decisively influence Harris's prospects for victory.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The demographics of Philadelphia County reveal a robust base of support for democratic candidates, making it imperative for any democratic hopeful, including Harris, to galvanize this urban electorate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Stierwald emphasizes the importance of Harris energizing this demographic.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Stierwald highlights how these regions have oscillated between supporting democratic candidates like Obama and republican candidates like Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Stierwald emphasizes that Harris's ability to effectively communicate her positions on pressing issues, such as the economy, healthcare access, and social justice initiatives, will be fundamental to her campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For Harris to capitalize on this, she must not only mobilize these demographics, but also craft a narrative that resonates with independents and moderate republicans.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Successfully appealing to a broad coalition will be vital for her electoral strategy.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The electoral landscape of Pennsylvania is of paramount importance for any presidential candidate, particularly for Kamala Harris, as it has historically served as a bellwether state that can decisively influence the overall outcome of elections.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The insights provided about Pennsylvania elucidate several key takeaways that encapsulate its significance, potential impacts, and the myriad consequences that Harris may encounter in her bid for the presidency.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The stark contrast between the Democratic stronghold of Philadelphia, a vibrant urban center characterized by its diverse and progressive population, and the Republican-leaning rural areas illustrates the pressing need for Harris to engage effectively with both segments of the electorate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The success of Harris's campaign hinges on her ability to bridge this significant divide, ensuring that her messaging resonates with urban voters who prioritize social justice, equality, and health care, while simultaneously addressing the concerns of rural voters who are more focused on economic recovery, job creation, and the revitalization of their communities.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For Harris to achieve a victorious outcome, she must inspire and galvanize high voter turnout in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburban areas, where a significant concentration of educated voters, particularly women and minorities, resides.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If Harris can effectively mobilize these groups, coupled with sustained enthusiasm from her core base, she could create a formidable coalition that significantly enhances her electoral prospects.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Furthermore, the historical voting patterns of Pennsylvania complicate Harris's path to victory even further.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris must present a compelling economic vision that not only appeals to urban voters, but also resonates deeply with rural constituents who may be experiencing significant economic distress.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Crafting policies that promise job creation, economic revitalization, and robust support for the working class will be crucial components of her campaign strategy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Another vital aspect to consider is the sentiment analysis surrounding Harris's campaign, which will significantly influence her electoral strategy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
A lack of strong turnout in Philadelphia or diminished support in suburban areas could easily tip the scales in favor of her vote.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The potential impacts of Harris's campaign in Pennsylvania extend beyond the immediate electoral outcome.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In summation, Pennsylvania represents a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing Kamala Harris in her presidential ambitions.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Ladies and gentlemen, American German Bulldog Nation, welcome to the Eric Dieter Show, well Trump had a Pennsylvania rally yesterday and he held up the, not held up, but he had the girl that came out that prepared his big chart that he says saved his life and it was a rip roaring rally and he let come on, there is habit.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, trump went to the black journals yesterday.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he's just direct, he went into the lion's den.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They thought they were going to get him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He turned it around.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump says social security should not be taxed.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, iran, trump had crippled Iran.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"With his sanctions after Biden and, uh, uh, Obama helped him out.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're saying Donald Trump's weird.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Cause he, you know, Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania said he was weird that he hugged the flag.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump hugged the flag.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I love that he fires back.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's a weird person.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But she's even worse for the Jews.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He says, Kamala's face.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So be warned, turn it off right now, but I had to say this when Kamala goes out there and says, tell it to my face.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So here we are, josh Shapiro begins his day as governor of Pennsylvania, but by this evening, he may be Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate on the Democratic ticket.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"As Pennsylvania Attorney General from 2017 to 2023, Josh Shapiro challenged many of them President Donald Trump's immigration policies, including the so-called Muslim ban, separating families at the border, and the attempt to change public charge rules to discourage immigrants from accessing certain government benefits.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, after their Pennsylvania debut, Harris and her new running mate planned visits together throughout the week to key battleground states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump is doubling down on his appeal to the state's industrial workers and rural communities, emphasizing his commitments to job creation and energy independence.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
His campaign is particularly focused on regions where industries like coal and manufacturing are vital.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris leads this poll by one point.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Again, Harris leads this poll by one point.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris leads this poll by two points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Trump won this poll by one point.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, some union households have been swayed by Trump's economic and trade policies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And who do you think will win Pennsylvania in 2024, Trump or Harris: share your predictions in the comments below.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's also expected to make a stop by a black-owned small business in Erie as the campaign is announcing a new effort today to build support among black voters like promoting proposals that give black men more economic opportunities.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Pretty much I like the way he, maybe not all the things he says, you know what I mean: it's kind of rough, but he gets results.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"All right, so Kelly, we are seeing former presidents Clinton and Obama both hit the campaign trail for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What are you hearing about our current president, President Biden: yeah, News Nation is learning that they are expecting President Biden to jump on the campaign trail for Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But we really haven't seen much of him on the campaign trail since.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So we know Harris is also kicking off her own battleground blitz.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's focusing on these northern battleground states to try to put up a fight against former president Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So Donald Trump has finally made an endorsement in Pennsylvania for the Senate race and he has endorsed none other than Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And this is what it comes down to, and Trump has this approach to endorsing which is very controversial.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Let's look at this endorsement draft that Trump drafted up here talking about.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Like I just can't get over this like electability thing and then Trump is buying into it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And it's crazy because Trump endorsed Sean Parnell early on and rightfully so.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Trump has an ego to him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's never going to back down, never going to apologize, we like that about him, but he doesn't at the same time want to endorse candidates that he feels like even with his endorsement can lose.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's a problem, so he's going to go out there and endorse Dr. Oz.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Maybe he sees him as the lesser of two evils, but he'll endorse him anyways because of my eloped ability.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And it's unfortunate, i mean, there's a lot of great candidates that could easily get a Trump endorsement.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And even if they would still fall short, I'd rather have Trump fall short with somebody good and have the week end up winning the primary, than have Trump endorse the week and have them win the primary by a resounding margin.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In 2016, former President Donald Trump won Pennsylvania by less than 1%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If I were Trump, frankly, I would not try for Pennsylvania, but but does this no point to it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Dr, blessing says Vice President Kamala Harris has reignited voter enthusiasm, especially among women.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Why do you think Kamala is different: oh, I don't know.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She first off, she doesn't seem to be part of the establishment.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She does seem to be an outside figure.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is going to represent a no vote against things that have been perceived has been going on for some time.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And here's how he explains Erie County, a mix of urban, rural and labor, a great patchwork of Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"At the end of the day, I think you heard in Bob Casey a sense that he believes he's closer to the heart of Pennsylvania and tried to staple Dave McCormick to Donald Trump, who is also popular, but he lost the state the last time around.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris has less than a single percentage point lead there.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"McCormick is kind of lagging Trump's vote share, I think because there are just a lot of Pennsylvanians who haven't made up their mind about him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Nathaniel was showing us the polls just super tight between former President Trump and Vice President Harris.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This race is different, he's actually pulling ahead of a lot of Republicans and helping them.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, I can tell you originally Republican leaders were looking at places like Ohio, places that are super red, that Donald Trump is expected to carry by a wide margin thinking that Sherrod Brown was frankly toast.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And on these issues, Donald Trump and Republicans for large clearly have the advantage.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that is true, i mean, they've been repelled by Trump because of abortion, because of J.D. Vance's childless cat lady comments, because of Trump's temperament, but Donald Trump has almost given up on wooing women.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he has very much leaned into trying to target men, not just conservative men, but sort of socially liberal men, Latino men, black men.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But one last thing I'll mention on this, Lindsay, and that is if it comes to a boys versus girls election, Harris still does have the advantage.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It says independent presidential candidate Cornell West lost the legal challenge Friday in his bid to get on the ballot in the ballot ground battleground state of Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court judge Renee Cone Jubileerer in a 15 page opinion sided with the Secretary of State's office under Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro in rejecting West candidacy paperwork The Secretary of State's office said West campaign lacked or card affidavits for 14 of the West 19 presidential electors So what I think is kind of going on to I don't know if that's the case here But what it looks like is I guess a lot of the states required maybe in addition to signatures also these electors who are Promising to vote for you But what ended up happening in the state of Arizona: there was a lot of controversy because Cornell West attempt to get on the ballot was actually being aided by Republican lawyers who were trying to make sure he could get on and so What the interviews of a couple of the electors said was they're like, hey when it was just Biden I was down with Cornell, but ever since Kamala was chosen.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There's also big two because of RFK dropping out, he's he's technically not dropped out He's suspended his campaign in swing states is gonna stay on the ballot in blue and red states So that's gonna give her a boost so Cornell not being on these ballots is absolutely huge These margins are gonna be really small like in the state of Michigan, for example, you know, the margin was 0.23% so We can actually take a look here over at the you know polls right now in Pennsylvania So in the polls in Pennsylvania right now Harris is up by 1.8 Which is solid, but I do believe if she wishes to wish to win the state of Pennsylvania She's gonna have to perform better than this.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is a really really big deal for the race Because again even like the smallest of a margin if you have two percent 1.5 votes time and then you get point four and Trump gets point one.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This can also turn the election for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So This is an absolutely massive thing for her which is her ability to get these as well in the state And so she needs to continue she's surging right now as it pertains to Hispanic voters and so hopefully she'll be able to keep it up I do have actually a hot take that I'm kind of toying with as well and that's I think that Pennsylvania is actually more likely to go blue than Wisconsin and so the reason why I actually say that is because for the poll numbers Pennsylvania here You can see was won by about 1.2 If we go through and we check the polls back in 2020 for Pennsylvania Joe Biden's up 4.7, right: he's up 4.7.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And it's hard to know, the Daily Mail came out with some reporting today based on different modeling that they had that said that Trump was ahead by almost 10 points at the electoral college.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So it's unclear, but there have been a lot of indications in Pennsylvania that perhaps things are leaning Trump's way.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's had a lot of rallies, but they're all out there in PA all the time.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden were making a joint appearance at the city's iconic Labor Day Parade, a tradition that holds deep meaning for many.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The crowd roared with excitement and enthusiasm as Biden and Harris took the stage, their energy infectious.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris faces a unique challenge.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She needs to convince voters she represents both continuity and change.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her campaign strategy reflects this delicate balance.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She embraces the successes of the Biden administration, particularly on affordable health care and economic opportunity.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"However, Harris also understands the need to distinguish herself.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She brings her own unique voice and perspective to the race.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her campaign emphasizes her commitment to issues like affordable child care and addressing income inequality.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is a seasoned politician with a deep understanding of the complex issues facing the nation today.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She has articulated clear and concise positions on a wide range of topics, from health care and immigration, to foreign policy and climate change.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"On health care, Harris has been a vocal advocate for expanding access to affordable and quality coverage.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She supports strengthening the Affordable Care Act and lowering the exorbitant cost of prescription drugs.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"On immigration, Harris has called for comprehensive reform that provides a clear pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her experience as the daughter of immigrants has given her a unique and valuable perspective on the challenges and opportunities presented by immigration.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris faces an uphill battle, but she is a formidable candidate with a compelling message that resonates with many.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her campaign has the potential to unite the Democratic Party and inspire voters across the political spectrum, bringing together a coalition of diverse voices.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The next few months will be crucial for Harris as she works to build momentum and gain the trust of undecided voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She needs to continue to articulate her vision for the country and connect with voters on a personal level, addressing their concerns and aspirations.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The upcoming debates will provide her with a valuable opportunity to draw a contrast between her approach and that of her opponents, showcasing her leadership qualities.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If she can successfully navigate the challenges ahead, she has a real chance of making history as the nation's first female president, breaking barriers and setting new precedents.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris represents a path forward, a path towards a more just and equitable society, where every voice is heard and valued.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I don't see Kamala bringing this.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But once it's done, I would like to give this to President Trump as well, just to give him a show of gratitude.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So I would love to give this to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He could be his own man and he says what he's what is on his mind and he's been consistent through the decades.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So that's why he's got my vote.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Coming down to the wire, presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is spending her Sunday meeting with the top contenders to be her running mate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her decision is expected to come very, very soon as Democratic delegates wrap up their roll call vote tomorrow.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Whoever Harris does select as her number two could have an impact on this race.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now one person said to be in the running for Harris's VP Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But of course here a lot of support among Pennsylvania Democrats for Harris to choose Shapiro.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Remember, it was only two weeks ago that President Biden exited the race and that the party rallied behind Harris to replace him at the top of the ticket.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It's something he says Shapiro could do very well for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For someone like Kamala Harris who appeals to progressives and is doing very, very well right now at the Democratic base, Shapiro helps her with independent voters, it helps her with non-college educated voters that she might not appeal to right now.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Watkins says he believes Shapiro is the kind of candidate that could pull Pennsylvania in favor of Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, Donald Trump was not out on the campaign trail today.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Joining us now is Caroline Levitt, the Trump campaign national press secretary.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's why President Trump is spending significant time there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he's also spending time there because he loves Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He loves the people of Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So he has a long history with the Commonwealth.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And the people of Pennsylvania were better off under President Trump's leadership than they are today.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And President Trump is winning Pennsylvania right now in many of the battleground states because again, people in many of the battleground polls, rather, because people there realize their lives were better off under his leadership.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So he's going to continue to visit Pennsylvania to make that case to the American people.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Will this Trump campaign: that's right.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Seven million viewers watched Kamala Harris on Fox News.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You're not Donald Trump, but nothing comes to mind that you would do differently.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, after months of really getting slammed for not doing interviews, Harris did sit down with Brit Bears you just saw on Fox News.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris was angry.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She was defensive, she couldn't give a single answer to a single question because the truth is the sad truth is Kamala Harris doesn't have answers.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She was asked very a very simple question.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She should have that off the top of her head and she refused to answer it because she refuses to take responsibility for the unprecedented crisis that we have at our southern border.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And if she can't recognize there's a problem, how is she going to be trusted to fix the problem: she can't.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She will continue, allow it to continue.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It became more clear than ever, I believe after that Fox News interview that President Trump needs to be reelected.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because Kamala can't handle the pressure of an interview with Fox News, she certainly can't handle the pressure of being president of the United States.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The former president actually went on Univision and took some very tough questions, including for one Latino farmer who picked strawberries and said his job is usually done by undocumented workers.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We need law and order and we need legal immigration, which President Trump has always been a proponent of.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's outside of Pittsburgh.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's got people with hard hats sitting there behind him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is Trump, this part of Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And as for those workers right, the whole essence of Trump's Make America Great Again really economically rests on his notion that America should make things again, manufacture this part of America, obviously, with the steel mills, which left 40 years ago there.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm going to bring that back entirely, but he thinks that the offshoring of American manufacturing, which was accomplished, essentially by investors over the course of many decades, was a mistake.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's a point of difference that he can underline for these workers as well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He has and he will.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's a key part of his appeal here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And in fact, there's numbers that back that up in Cambria County, where Donald Trump is speaking right now since 2019, when New York Times found it, I thought this was interesting, that they have actually six percent fewer jobs from 2019 to 2023.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I can't even get by here, that is a clarion call that Trump is making to people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He can turn that around, now, can he: i don't know, but they certainly blame the current administration.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Terry, one more thing, if you don't mind, I want to drill down on this idea of Pennsylvania and some of these Republican heavy counties, because the Trump strategy is to run up the vote totals in places like where he is now in Johnstown, which can be a swingish city, but it's in a county that's heavily Republican and it's surrounded by counties that are heavily Republican.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is trying to penetrate that.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We're seeing Trump doing it and we're seeing the Harris-Wallis campaign doing this work.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He said about how he would vote, quote, he said first he would be voting no.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So he seems to try to kind of split the issue here and say that he doesn't agree with the six week ban, but he's also going to vote no on the ballot measure that would overturn the six week ban.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump wants no part of that because he sees the mainstream.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"While preparing for the debate, a source tells CBS News that Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke over the phone this weekend.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Clinton, who debated Trump three times during the 2016 election, offered her advice.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris has also been preparing by holding mock debates.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, sources say Trump's preparation has included reviewing policy positions with advisers.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He elected to have the final statement of the night.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You've talked to many of the members of the Cabinet currently, former President Trump, Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For Kamala Harris, I think it's reassuring people that she's really up for the job.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I think there's every reason to believe she is.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"After all, she's been vice president, a U.S. senator, a state attorney general, a district attorney.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But the question is reassuring people that she's on top and that she has specific policies that people want to hear about.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think that's her goal tonight.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I will let you know exactly why the reason is that Kamala Harris is going to ultimately win the state of Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, why is it that this is very good news for Kamala Harris in the final days leading up to what will be the most consequential, the most important state for either candidate to have a smooth sailing path to victory on election night: the reasons are that Pennsylvania is a extremely diverse, extremely blue collar state, and is also a very large population.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump struggles with nearly all of those groups of voters, and in 2016, he was able to win over voters with a populist message, right: he talked the talk of raising the minimum wage and keeping jobs and manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania and in America.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And people bought it up because he was an unknown commodity.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But now what Pennsylvania voters are looking at is Donald Trump's awful track record on manufacturing jobs and his awful job record overall.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I think as the Kamala Harris and Tim Walz campaign has been driving home on that point, it's something that's resonating in places especially like Pennsylvania with such a high percentage of blue collar workers.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, also what Pennsylvania has is a very large amount of suburban communities, right, and what has happened since the 2020 election when Donald Trump narrowly lost against Joe Biden, lost the state of Pennsylvania, okay: donald Trump has incited an insurrection against the United States of American government in sending a model of supporters to overturn a free and fair election by subverting the certification of the electoral college which Joe Biden rightfully won.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We've seen Roe v. Wade fall and Donald Trump take credit for that time and time again.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And we've also seen Donald Trump be indicted on various federal crimes, not limited to sexually assaulting, being found liable for sexually assaulting E. Jean Carroll in a New York City dressing room in 1994.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump was able to win them over in 2016 by lying to them but his track record hasn't given them anything to gravitate to, especially since 2020 and also since he got elected and I think that his various troubles that he's having legally, it's gonna come to bear in a very important state like Pennsylvania in this upcoming election but that's all I got for you guys in this one, please be sure to like the video, subscribe to the channel, share with someone who's into politics and I'll catch you guys in the next video, peace.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Alright man, so we got some absolutely huge news here for the Kamala Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So I did previously report on how Kamala Harris is actually already gearing up for a legal battle for the election results after.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump is basically already saying that he's going to deny the election results regardless of what ends up happening.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he ends up losing, I think he even said that he would win California if Jesus was the vote counter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So he's very clear that he's obviously going to try to steal the election again, just like he did last time.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So she's preparing prior to that as opposed to reacting, right: so the reports are currently saying that she's already amassed a legal team about 10 times the size.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But this is huge, huge news, again, this story going back says Kamala Harris hires a massive legal team to fight back against election denials.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The Harris for President campaign is staffing up with hundreds of lawyers as the campaign expects to have to battle Republicans on multiple fronts during and after the election this year.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So we can see that it's likely almost guaranteed that he's going to try to steal the election again.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala has clearly proven that she's sort of more of a proactive person.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's been reaching out to House surrogates almost immediately after she was chosen to be the nominee.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So we know that the establishment and Nancy Pelosi, their plan was actually not to pick Kamala Harris and what ended up happening.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
AOC came out and warned us and ends up she actually was right.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We also know these different kinds of things about what's going on with Kamala Harris being proactive as opposed to reactive.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so I think Kamala Harris needs to make sure she's continuing to fight these legal matters right now and then obviously being prepared for what happens later, what comes later.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So really, really good news for the Kamala Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If Donald Trump wins the 2024 election, will you trust the results: yes, I will.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, i believe so, but I know if Kamala gets in, we're going to have World War III.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So we definitely don't want her in, and this is one of your top sellers here: one of them.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yes, sir, and it says Trump that bitch: yes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yep, we're here to support our President Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The last time we saw him and supported him, my son and I were at Washington, D.C. January 6th.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I pulled him out of school for that day.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We went there, supported him, had a great time, got our lung full of tear gas and left.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So are you saying that Kamala Harris is actually wearing earbuds: yes.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"When she goes into a debate, take out her earrings.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And if Donald Trump doesn't win, will you be upset: oh, yeah.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's letting all these people from other countries come over here.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Did he pay his bills, did people like working with it: of course he did.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He always paid his bills: yes.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yes, he did, okay.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And they say he probably won't pay again.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I don't know, they sent him a bill for $35,000.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, he pays his bills.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There was the best 10 to 12- He got a bill for $35,129 that he refused to pay.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Great, you have a shirt here and it's Trump, and then you've put duct tape over another name.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And why did you put the tape over Mike Pence's name there: well, it's not just because he refused to decertify the election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's because Mike Pence has come out as the rhino that he's always been and said that those of us that vote for Trump are toxic.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Did you put the tape over Mike Pence's name because you believe he should have refused to certify the election results: well, I felt that way at the time.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Correct, if she loses the election and then decides that she says there's voter fraud and things like that, and she decides she is not going to certify the election results, how will you feel about that: i don't know.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, if Trump wins and she refuses to certify the election results, how will you feel: well, that's her right.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She can refuse to certify, that's her right.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We'll have to see, what is this shirt here: donald Trump for America.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The old tank, let's go America.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, yes, sir, is this how you picture Donald Trump: yeah.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump wearing shirtless with a very tight body.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Is that is is that what do you think he looks like with his shirt up: possibly.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If you had to bet on it, do you think that's what he looks like with his shirt up: just hopeful thinking I guess.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Why wouldn't you want to be here to cheer this fellow on, what makes Donald Trump so special: oh, my goodness.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"His honesty, his bravery, donald Trump, you think he's a very honest guy: oh, he's horrifically, wonderfully honest.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Horrifically honest, and wonderfully honest, so he said that he won the 2020 election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He said just just the other day, we actually lost it by a whisker.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, maybe he's had more pertinent information.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Any final message you would leave for Donald Trump if you were watching this: just watch.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You trust the election if Trump wins.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think he won.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It was called a blue mirage.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump was never accused of inciting insurrection.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"OK, he couldn't be bought, everybody loved Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They loved everything about him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Oprah, New York, oh, Donald Trump, they loved and loved and loved.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Are you excited to be at a Trump rally right now: i'm very excited.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
To see Trump would fill you with joy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Oh, yeah, do you do you feel like Trump gives you joy on a daily basis: yes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Trump campaign of course had a field day with with that with those remarks there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's the county surrounding Pittsburgh it's a Democratic stronghold but still a couple hundred thousand plus Republican votes here for Trump both in 2016 and 2020.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris was there on Monday speaking to a crowd of about 6,000 in Erie and then Governor Walls was hitting some of the rural counties surrounding Erie Pennsylvania as well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That exploded with Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
If Trump is somehow able to even raise the margins further in Metro Pittsburgh that will offset some of his expected losses in Philadelphia collar.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So when you look at the Harris campaign they've taken so many different stops in rural deep red areas of Pennsylvania that from an outsider perspective you're thinking why are they spending their time.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Where eating into those margins both in the city of Pittsburgh but really Allegheny County these areas that Harris needs a maximum voters in order to win Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I wouldn't shock me if in the last few weeks that we see Donald Trump make an appearance in Philadelphia proper.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It took a little while for Kamala Harris to announce her economic policy handbook.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But when she did you know she cribbed Trump's idea for no tax on tips.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then you know Trump has always run as an economic populist since he walked down that golden escalator nine years ago I guess almost a decade since he's been on the political scene.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You know he's always been a supporter of tariffs.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think that Trump's decision to pick Vance as his running mate signals that that's kind of where he wants the party to move.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's where I spend the majority of my time and you know looking if Trump does win there's certainly that old guard new guard Republican tensions that we've really been seeing since 2017.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Vice President Harris hailed her new running mate as a veteran, six term congressman and two term governor who is prepared to take on their rivals.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Tim and I have a message for Trump and others who want to turn back the clock on our fundamental freedoms.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We're not going back, the Harris campaign says Walz beat out eight others for the job.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris offered it to him Tuesday morning as campaign cameras rolled.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Sources close to the campaign say it was Walz's leadership experience, his rapport with Harris and his communication skills that earned him the spot.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Make no mistake, violent crime was up under Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's not even counting the crimes he committed.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You're already seeing Republicans, you know, resurface those concerns after Governor Walz was announced, as Vice President Harris was running mate last night.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This is a topic that can be tough, and you're already seeing Donald Trump obviously talk about this as a campaign issue.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he wants to win, Donald Trump must win the key swing state of Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Obviously, what's so shocking about that: well, I don't think some people understand how truly important Pennsylvania is, especially for the Trump campaign, because I really believe if Trump suffers a defeat in Pennsylvania, his pathway to the presidency is all but gone.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And yeah, it would hurt if Trump were to lose Pennsylvania, but it's not the end of the world.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's going to be the state that if Trump wins it, he's probably going to win the presidency.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
If Harris wins it.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, I want to be clear that I am not saying there is no pathway for Trump if he loses Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like, if he loses it, yeah, of course, there are many pathways for Trump here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But outside of that, you cannot lose a single state of your Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because if he does, mathematically speaking, Harris at above 270.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I really believe that, because while yes, Harris, if she loses Pennsylvania, it becomes very difficult for her to win.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So Harris, if she wins it, I really think she's got the presidency.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But if she loses it, well, it becomes very difficult.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But I think it's much more plausible that this happens than, oh, yeah, Trump is able to run the table everywhere else.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he loses Pennsylvania, he's done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, I do want to discuss the current state of the race in Pennsylvania because it is obvious it's a must win state for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, 80,000 votes separated Trump and Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Because she has none.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Demographically speaking, this is a state that should go for Trump by like five points at the bare minimum.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If we assume Trump is up in Pennsylvania again, this is a hypothetical.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's over here, it's no, he can afford to lose.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The former president of the United States, Donald Trump, rallied at Pennsylvania yesterday, went south after someone tried to pop him up.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You guys know the people who have Donald Trump, everything very hard.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It has packed a lot of conversation guys and these are some of the clips that have gathered on the reaction of what happened during Donald Trump's rally at Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The things that are going to happen are going to happen anyway either president, it doesn't matter but that does not mean that I want Trump to get in.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump you better you better keep your head low you better keep your head low that was probably the first war.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The assassination attempt on Donald Trump's life yeah I'm just struggling to kind of wrap my head around that one.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
While Trump was on stage at a rally in Pennsylvania a sniper from some distance attempted to assassinate him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Missed him though just grazed his ear.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Mind you when it comes to policies socioeconomic status his race well every fucking thing about him he is not a victim and nor is the majority of his fans but shit now they are I guess because you know the right wing spin factory is a fucking machine.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This despite the fact that shootings for literally every reason over the past however many years have been by right-wing people who follow all these right-wing demagogues that are about to be like the leftist what caused this and everything and use this as their opportunity expect to see people pulling comments online of people previously talking about how Trump should get you know.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And how he miss JP how he miss bar: he missed.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He missed on purpose.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And staying with the U.S. presidential election, former President Barack Obama has opened a can of worms after he lectured black men to vote for Kamala Harris while speaking in Pennsylvania last week.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania

"Barack Obama wanted to gather more support for Vice President Kamala Harris, but he's managed to do the opposite.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But Trump is trying to change the tide.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He knows that he's growing popular among the Hispanic community.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Democrats are reaching out to people of color, and so is Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He already enjoys the support of white male voters by an overwhelming number.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris just can't catch a break.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A resurfaced clip from 2019 is blowing up, it's reminding everyone about her nutty anti-fracking stance.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now with Pennsylvania in place, she's trying to backpedal.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"How convenient, right: the people aren't letting her get away with it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"We'll cover her flip-flop, why voters aren't buying it, and why this lie in particular is extremely important for voters in states like Pennsylvania and others.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
You see back then Harris was proudly declaring that climate change is the single greatest threat facing our world today.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, and she wasn't stopping there.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She was saying also that she was committed to passing the Green New Deal.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris's stance back then was loud and clear.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But who how times have changed, as soon as Kamala set her sights on the White House, things got, shall we say, flexible.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now Dana Bash's credit, what she just asked her there was, well, you said that your values have not changed.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So so then what we heard on Jimmy Fallon, she has not changed that position, but then listen to the flip flop.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"My values have not changed, again, she keeps saying my values have not changed.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's what she said, what I have seen is that we can we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"How is that possible, Kamala: and she won't explain it because she has no idea what she's saying.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's just trying to get the votes.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Harris currently holds a razor thin lead here.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now Trump is always undercounted, but still, so naturally Trump isn't wasting any time.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's very good work for the people that Kamala Harris traditionally doesn't give a shit about.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And get this, this latest gaffe might just cost her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala is lying to the people for their votes about their very livelihood.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's lying to them and hoping that she'll get through to them with the lie so that she can put them out of work.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Even that's a bold place lie, but she threw out some more words out because he didn't have an answer.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"When Trump was asked the question, he very succinctly said, drill baby drill.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You can't explain this to a communist progressive like Kamala Harris because it doesn't affect her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania

"President Trump is somebody that I appreciate for his fight, his tenacity, his wisdom, and his ability to get things done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's a dealmaker, and he never loses sight of the American people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But not President Trump, he was going to be honest with you and genuine with you, and here is the situation and here is the truth.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He doesn't think he's any better than you.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"They think they're smarter than you and that they can sell you a line and a story, and that's not President Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
President Trump is himself.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's fighting for you.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's fighting to protect you and your family, and he loves this country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He loves this country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"People ask me, we love Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We love Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's listening to you right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's listening to you, and he hears you, and he hears you.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris is in Pennsylvania tonight, which may very well be the most important tipping point state in this year's election.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris needs to keep her attention on places like Wilkes-Barre, where she is not going to win outright, but she could lose by less than her predecessor did.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And every little bit can help Harris get over the top and win the all-important state.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And you're seeing Vice President Harris do that with her stops in Wilkes-Barre and Johnstown today.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I do think that people do get frustrated with Donald Trump because of his own personal grievances.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, they're exhausted with all of his complaints about January 6.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He was beaten badly there, but he did a little bit better there.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But every other county is where his margin slipped.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think that's what we're seeing Vice President Harris do.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think Kamala Harris has demonstrated that she's that leader.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But Harris had to get herself adjusted on that issue because it speaks to a lot of working Americans who can identify with that industry.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Trump's ability to energize rural voters and maintain his working-class base will be key to his campaign's success.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, in 2016, Pennsylvania flipped red, with Trump securing a narrow victory of less than one percent, making it one of the key states that handed him the White House.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The current polling data, showing Trump with a slight two-point lead over Harris, underscores how competitive Pennsylvania will be in 2024.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Rural voters in Pennsylvania have been a key part of Trump's coalition.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"While Biden was able to make inroads with some of these voters in 2020, Trump's appeal remains strong in these areas, and he will need to maintain or even expand his rural support to win Pennsylvania in 2024.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Pennsylvania is a major producer of natural gas, and Trump's support for the fossil fuel industry has been popular in regions like the western part of the state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That they're just badly coordinated and they can't figure out what's going on like Kamala people getting bounced from meetings, Kamala's people not really, I mean they can't make direct contact, they're not picking up the phone and stuff like that.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And this is worrisome for her campaign for obvious reasons.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Well the markets have decided Kamala's got a 70% chance of winning.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's stunning and brave.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I believe that the Kamala Harris camp is getting nervous.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris has to go it alone with her campaign ads but it's not really a down ballot effort.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, the down ballaters aren't coordinating with the Kamala campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Meanwhile Trump has a different problem.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"His problem is that he has less money on him and the Republican apparatus has given him this cold shoulder at the neocon level, the party leadership.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's got an extensive ground game with private volunteers and local field offices and stuff like that.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're not really behind Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So yeah Kamala is angry at the Pennsylvania state and local officials.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kind of can't blame her actually when you think about it.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And as Kristen said, for the most part, he did talk about economic matters, all the signage of the event that will get replayed as people see the clips are about his proposals about no taxes on tips and on Social Security and the like.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So he's trying to pre-butt that a little bit and to lean into an issue where he has an advantage right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's a better deficit for Harris than it was with Joe Biden on the issue of the economy.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But clearly issue number one for voters is still an advantage category for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So how much is he hurting himself when he loses focus on that specific issue: well, he wouldn't be hurting himself, but it sounds like today he kept his focus.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, this is obviously one of two issues that he has to win on.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He has to continue to do that because people cannot allow Harris to run as a disconnected figure.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They can't believe that she just, you know, fell out of a coconut tree, as it were, and has nothing to do with Joe Biden, his policies, his results, because she is his number two.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The less Biden there is, the better off she's going to be.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's why Trump's got to keep bringing it up.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Don't quit whining about her, we knew it was going to be her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's not going to give an interview.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It's not going to win talking about whether she's dumb.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's crazy, you know why she hasn't done an interview: because she's not smart.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's not intelligent, all right.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But there was so much veering off, he was talking about her Time magazine cover.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He was personally insulting her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And the name calling and the nastiness does not help Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris has shown to not only bolster excitement amongst the Democratic coalition, she's also shown to expand that base and its reach, particularly with Gen Z, a lot of younger diverse voters were seeing the attacks on women's reproductive rights that have fallen flat for the right and they consistently continue to do so.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And all that we're seeing from Donald Trump time and time again, no matter where he's speaking, be it whether it's the press, whether it's on Twitter, it is always attacks on things of the past and bringing up taking America back.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But the Harris campaign cannot get overconfident.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She needs to be running multiple points ahead.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And of course, Trump is trying to take her back to her days in California when she was anti-Trump fracking.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But she's evolved, and she's changed that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She saw Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's talked to people from Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And for the last four years, she's been acceptable and for fracking.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So I think she has to articulate that tonight.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So what are the main issues you think she has to articulate tonight: well, the first thing I think she has to do is be herself.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And she's such an authentic, nice, warm person.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She gets teased by the magotypes for her laughter and her smile.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But it's something that distinguishes her from Trump, who has no warmth.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The second thing is, I think she has to show the strength.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She has about a 13 percent advantage with women, but she's down 5 percent with men.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And it's not as if the Harris administration can push any old left wing legislation to the Congress.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You know, 27 percent of the people say they don't have enough information about Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And now we know what's happening, trump can't really rise above.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, everybody knows who he is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So he has to drag her down.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This places Trump ahead by a narrow margin of one percentage point.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's base continues to rally around his messages on the economy, particularly his approach to job creation and business regulation.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"On the other hand, Harris's supporters emphasize the importance of progressive policies, particularly those aimed at healthcare reform and social equity.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This poll indicates that Trump maintains a slight lead, but the contest remains competitive.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's messaging often resonates with voters concerned about border security and economic opportunities.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Mobilizing younger voters and independents will also be essential to bridge the gap and potentially overcome Trump's lead.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The results from this poll suggest that Harris's campaign may be resonating well with voters, particularly among those prioritizing issues such as health care, labor rights, and economic equity.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For Harris, the challenge will be to maintain and expand her lead among key voter groups, including young voters and minorities, while also appealing to independent voters who may be swayed by economic messages.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her campaign could benefit from emphasizing the importance of accessible health care and economic opportunities for all Nevadans.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania Dem issues warning to Harris about potential Josh Shapiro VP pick.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Democrat Erin McClelland suggested Vice President Kamala Harris should not pick Gov. Josh Shapiro to be her running mate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
A Democrat seeking statewide office in Pennsylvania is not a fan of Gov. Josh Shapiro and has warned Vice President Kamala Harris that she should look elsewhere for a running mate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Finally, I think, Vice President Harris, whoever she picks, we're going to stand behind her, she's going to do a great job.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The treasury candidate remained unapologetic for her comments and doubled down on her thinny veil criticisms of Shapiro in an interview with the New York Post.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"McClelland also said she has not spoken with Street since the controversy over her post, but believes their relationship will be fine.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Color me, thunderstruck, she told the Post.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"McClelland was quick to add, though, that she would support the Democratic ticket regardless of who is nominated for vice president, but praised Cooper as the best choice.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Washington Post national political reporter Ozzy Pibara, ozzy, we kept mentioning that Vice President Harris is now leading in national polls, but this election will most likely come down to a few battleground states, including Pennsylvania, where she and President Biden are today.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, what the electoral votes are, what is going to decide this election: donald Trump has had a challenge winning popular votes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That was a political liability for Republicans and particularly for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He has been trying to find a way to claim ownership of this issue without the liability.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is a political liability for Republicans and specifically for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's also touting his tariff policy and vowing to take on the CCP.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But while Trump says his policies will bring companies back to the US without raising costs for consumers.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The hears his campaign is calling Trump's positions unpopular and damaging.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump on through social is calling on voters here to get out and vote saying quote if you have a ballot return it immediately and if not go vote at the polls right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Vice President Harris is running mate Governor Tim Walz announced new plans from the team for America's rural areas.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Chip, let's start with you, vice President Harris has agreed to an interview with Fox News tomorrow, Fox's Brett Baier.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Brett Baier has been tough on Trump and I assume he's going to have tough questions for her.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But the real question here is, is that, you know, why won't Trump do this as well, why won't Trump go with Brett Baier and others, and what does he have to hide: i mean, I know what we all know what they're going to ask questions.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're going to ask her about immigration.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're going to ask her about the border bill.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"They're going to ask, you know, again, you saw Youngkin talking the other day about Trump's promise to go after Schiff and other radical left the United States with the military.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There's a lot there that she can answer to.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So I think she's going to do well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think this is really smart on her behalf.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think she realizes that there are people that are going to come watch this.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So I think she sees this as an opportunity and a good one.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Bobby, what would you like to see Brett Baier ask Kamala Harris: well, yeah, this is a good this is a question.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She has been asked these questions before.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Brett tends to be tough on Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I don't really think she puts a lot at risk there because of the way the campaign's been trending.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"How much to align with Biden versus how much to differentiate herself from him, what approach do you think would be the best path forward for her right now: i'm a big Joe Biden fan.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, Bobby, during her recent appearance on ABC's The View, Vice President Harris was asked if she would have done anything differently than Biden during their term together.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Chip, VP Harris recently announcing a new initiative in Pennsylvania aimed at black men to offer forgivable business loans to black entrepreneurs and create more apprenticeships.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Only 12 percent said they would vote for Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that is why Trump's going on these podcasts.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And the reason is because he's not afraid to go out there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's not afraid to talk issues and just tell it like it is.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"People on the street interviews when they're talking about Kamala Harris is fake, just not real.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They don't know where she stands on anything.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Biden carried it by one percentage point in 2020, making Erie County kind of a bellwether.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm sure that's why Harris is there, and she has a message not just for Erie County, but statewide, correct: correct Major, this is actually going to be the vice president's 10th visit to Pennsylvania since becoming the presidential nominee.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So right before she comes here to the arena, she is actually sitting down having a conversation with black men about the economy and about the opportunities that she claims she can create for them.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That includes Latino men, which is why they just launched Ombre's for Harris out west, and black men, which is why you saw former President Obama speak directly to them when he was campaigning in Pittsburgh last week.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Competing with the crowd and the music around her, we did doing a gamely, as always.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Thank you very much, i want to go down to Caitlin Huey Burns joins us just outside of Philadelphia, covering former President Trump's town hall.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"These events, but major, I can say after traveling with the Trump campaign for the past several months now, this is when they are starting to target these areas.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But when you look at our polling on the issue of immigration, he does leave Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We have not heard the last of Trump saying he could use the United States military to pursue the quote enemy from within.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump just got great news out of the key swing state of Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We have to talk about the 2024 presidential election because Donald Trump has great news out of Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Like if Trump wins Pennsylvania more than likely he wins the presidency and vice versa.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
If Harris wins Pennsylvania more than likely she wins the presidency.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I don't think it's enough for Harris to win Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But the only reason it's not like a Trump plus one lead is because of the Suffolk poll for those that don't know Suffolk University is one of the worst pollsters out there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Their final 2020 poll was, you know, Trump plus two.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're off by three points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They found Trump up by two.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But even then when you average it all out, Trump has retaken the lead in Pennsylvania for the first time since August or actually the end of August.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right now Trump's up by, you know, point two percent and that's with an outlier.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If this wasn't for Suffolk, it would be probably Trump plus one.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's actually winning despite Suffolk pushing garbage pull-out that had Harris up by three, which compared to everyone else is an outlier.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Despite that, RCP still has Trump with a lead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I got elected governor, she went to the U.S. Senate and then the vice presidency and we've maintained a close relationship and I think she's an extraordinary public servant.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For now, Shapiro says he's focused on electing Harris and serving as Pennsylvania's governor.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I try and think about the job I have to do right before me, and that is to be the best governor I can be and politically to focus on helping Kamala Harris and Tim Valls be elected president and vice president.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Can you tell us a little bit more about that anticipation that it hasn't just been going on today: i mean, this has been going on since Trump said he was going back to Butler, Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Let's take a listen to part of Trump's speech at the RNC.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's according to the polling, now, the rally over the weekend was supposed to serve as a bit of a reset to Donald Trump's campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, Trump's having difficulty sticking to that message.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Obviously, Kamala Harris has managed to get under his skin and she's on his mind.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so take a look at how he decided to essentially go off message, go off that strategy and instead attack Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Two would believe this, 80 days from now we are going to defeat a communist known as Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's a communist.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This is communist, this is Marxist, this is fascist, but you know what: it's dangerous because she's saying that she's gonna give away things that she'll never be able to get approved.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Have you heard her laugh: that is the laugh of a crazy person.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Have you heard it: you know, they prohibited her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They prohibited her for laughing.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I've been waiting for her to laugh because as soon as she laughs, the election's over.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And now here he is speaking out against those economic policies that his voters had previously found appealing, right: hey, don't scroll away.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's a lot to respond to there, so first off, he says, they say I'm rambling, but I don't ramble.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And then he goes on to ramble, i mean, and epically so, and then he did an ode to rambling.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He never folds them.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He always goes on and on and on, if you warn your own MAGA audience, then you're not doing it right.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And so he's not playing the greatest hits.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He used to do that, he'd say build the wall, lock her up, etc.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But his fans loved it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he would talk to Anna's point about economic populism.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He didn't mean it, but at least he was savvy enough to pretend to give you things, right: he's totally lost the thread on that because he just rambled his way out of what he was actually campaigning on.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's defending his owners.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's a great way to lose, so he's just absolutely ruining his own campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he responds to every attack line.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's just not right, so like when they call- He's on the defense now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now the most important thing, Anna, is he's as usual, but now he can't contain himself.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's obsessed with himself.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So he's not talking about the people at all.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She said Kamala has one big advantage.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So first of all, why did you, no, but hey, the Rambler, why did you wind up giving five minutes of your speech to how hot Kamala Harris is: like, first of all, before you even got to how you're hotter, which is just insanity.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Then when Trump says I'm more attractive, the crowd cheered not because of a conventional definition of beauty, but rather because he's white, they're deeply racist.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's talking about, oh, she's so attractive.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And they're like, oh, right, and then he says, but I'm hot.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I just, I can't believe how much he has bungled his own campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like, he's totally lost, i really did think, okay, like they've been very strategic over at the Trump camp.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I remember being at the RNC and actually being impressed with how he was sticking to the script and how he was going along with the strategy and it was working.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He should have expected it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And they should have strategized and he should stick to the strategy, but he can't help himself.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's totally discombobulated, okay.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like anyone paying close attention to politics should have, including, and especially the Trump campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Anyway, let's get back to the story because, look, him saying I'm more attractive than Kamala Harris is obviously weird.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But it's especially weird when you consider what Trump had to say last week.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So let's go to that, yeah, yeah, i saw a picture of her on Time Magazine today.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She looks like the most beautiful actress ever to live.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And actually, she looked very much like a great first lady, Melania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But of course, she's a beautiful woman, so we'll leave it at that, right, so are you saying you're more attractive than your wife: no, I haven't thought of that with transitive property.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Why he's fixated on our looks, but most importantly, guys, his inability to pivot is actually kind of stunning.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But even so, he keeps using talking points about Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, so like he'll even go to like, oh, Biden was too old.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And at this point, you're 20 years older than Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So if you're a Republican, you want Trump to about age, but he's still talking about age because he can't get off his old talking points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That shows total incompetence, and you just don't, you're supposed to be attacking Kamala Harris on her policies like immigration cramps.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
You think she's heard this advice: i'm sure he's heard his advice.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The thing that I've always given Trump credit for is I felt that he understood marketing.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He understood how to sell it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And right now he is flailing and his messaging is so disastrous.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Maybe he doesn't understand, yeah, I saw Bernie speak earlier today, and he's still totally the same Bernie as he was before.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so you know that I haven't thought that Trump had an age problem because I'm like, look, if you think the things he's saying is crazy, he's always been crazy, right: and he's always been unintelligent, etc.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Running against Kamala Harris, not Joe Biden, and he doesn't seem to understand that.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Obviously, it's gonna be a very close election, but everyone was claiming that Trump was secretly down by 15 points in Pennsylvania that he was gonna lose the election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
With some the polls showing Trump's actually having a small lead.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like, insider polling, which did drop a couple days ago, but they found Trump plus two.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Are they perfect: no, but, right now, they have Trump up by a couple points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Emerson, yeah, Emerson found Trump with a small lead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Emerson and insider advantage, they're good pollsters, and right now, they found Trump plus one and Trump plus two.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"No, this is Marist slash NPR, they are a left-leaning pollster, and they found the race at best tied for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I'm not trying to say that's for sure gonna happen, but these pollsters have track records of understating Trump by a couple points at the bare minimum.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But when you go to the RCP average, you would think, oh, with Trump being tied with Marist, tied in the Washington Post, up with Emerson, up with insider advantage, you would think the RCP average would be Trump plus one or even like Trump plus 0.5.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, it's not, right now, it's Harris plus one.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
There were four pollsters that dropped Harris leads.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"How is it possible when everyone else, even Franklin and Marshall found Harris plus three: and for those that don't know, Franklin and Marshall is a trash pollster.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But even they found Harris up by only three.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So you could argue, well, maybe within the margin of error, which is four points, it could be a Trump lead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But what's the excuse for Quinnipiac or even The New York Times, i mean, how do you find Harris plus four, Harris plus five right now: would everyone else, even the Washington Post or even Franklin and Marshall, they're finding the race, you know, within the margin of error.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You can't make this up, quinnipiac had Trump losing seniors by like three.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I can understand, you know, oh, maybe it's a tight race in Pennsylvania and then Trump's tied in the popular vote.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Harris plus four in Pennsylvania doing three points better than Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There might have been a couple, like one or two, but yeah, there was two polls out of Pennsylvania or actually just one in the final month of the election that had Trump winning Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Right now they have Trump winning.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Quinnipiac, d plus eight, right now D plus five, new York Times, a five point shift towards Trump, suffolk, a four point shift towards Trump, cBS News, a seven point shift, trafalgar, four point shift, cNN, a 10 point shift, every one of these polls have shifted towards Trump and at the bare minimum by three points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Again, we got to see what happens, i'm not saying that Trump's going to win Pennsylvania by four points or whatever, but you cannot tell me that this is a fluke that nearly every poll.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
All they found was Harris right now at the same time period.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She is doing worse than Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"We got to see what happens, it could be a fluke, could be, you know, oh, actually the polls overstate Trump this time.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, like you could argue it could go to Harris fine, but a Harris plus five poll is not it's not feasible right now.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's not going to happen, she's not going to win Pennsylvania by four or five points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is at 51 percent unfavorable.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump is at 52 percent.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What I will say is we're seeing a lot of support right now for President Trump on college campuses, particularly among the young men.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I think that's kind of what pushed us to get so involved is that like the other side, Donald Trump's America is so scary to us.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's endorsed by Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Did you see last the last presidential debate: trump was horrid.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She also wrote Trump is good for beer, for beers and barbecue, not as a president and claim that Trump's moral character is questionable.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Why does Hannity support unprincipled Donald Trump: and it gets worse.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So Donald Trump constantly on Fox News doing the birtherism thing.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Maybe he's from Africa.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He never probably necessarily said he's Muslim, but that was the whole implication of the entire birtherism thing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so Fox News fuels this birtherism, which then fuels Trump and now is utterly appalled that they're losing control of it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then you have the Tea Party losing control to the Trump movement.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now all of a sudden Trump has endorsed Dr. Oz and you've got somebody who's taking the birtherism and the and the and Obama's a Muslim and all this crazy stuff, which YouTube monitors.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's so interesting that Trump endorsed Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's obvious, but Dr. Oz is sort of problematic from a like if you are a hardcore Trump voter, Dr. Oz is not somebody that you want to hold your nose and have to vote for.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's argument is that Dr. Oz is who can win the general election.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And so Trump is using this line that Dr. Oz is who can win the general election.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She recently said that the first time she voted in Pennsylvania the one she really remembers was voting in the primary for Donald Trump in 2016.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So is this a win for Trumpism and a loss for Trump if she wins.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah this is a this is a big one, trump has backed Perdue and then Mike Pence has actually elevated his involvement on the Kemp side which is really interesting.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, i mean the only thing that he didn't do is steal the election for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But President Trump conducting diplomacy with our enemies, I think was very was very important for for our country to maintain our status as the world's number one superpower.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's what President Trump did.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump offers a a different approach.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris must have Pennsylvania's 19 Electoral College votes.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If she loses Pennsylvania, she can't win.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Don't don't mistake him, i apologize if I wasn't clear.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So Trump has got to be feeling pretty good right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is Donald Trump who will say anything and everything depending on where the wind is blowing.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So are Democrats right to question Trump's sincerity on this issue: well, look, it is a campaign season, so every statement is going to be questioned for sincerity.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump actually has been quite supportive of IVF.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's going to get attacked for it from both the left and the right.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"On Fox News, he largely focused on immigration and the border.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, a lot of these Republicans don't mind his economic policies, maybe not as protectionist view on trade, but they like low taxes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Drive down a gravel road just past a cornfield and you will find how Vice President Harris plans to win the election.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Someone says you know they're concerned about reproductive health care, you want to talk about Kamala Harris' opinions on that.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In swing Northampton County, Pennsylvania, Democratic volunteers meet weekly to strategize, before hitting the streets and pushing every way they can for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Hello, my name is Vanessa and I'm a volunteer with the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There's a lot of enthusiasm since Kamala Harris got into the race for you know getting out and voting for her, but I think people are very you know concerned it's such a close race.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Among the things this woman told us is that Joe Biden is actually dead, replaced by a fake.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For Rodney Nace, it's about Trump's track record.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Carlos is a truck driver and a lifelong Democrat voting for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Like her, he opposes abortion bans.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I am voting for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Jackie blames Democrats and Harris for high prices from food to homes and for what she sees as a lower work ethic.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I generally just do not think that Mr. Trump could, uh, could lead the country at all.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"One thing we noticed, we did not find any Democrats for Trump, but we did meet Republicans against him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What don't you like about Trump, where do I start: like Dolores Cole, we met her at that Republican event.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They just worship their God who is Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's it, he can do no wrong even though he does.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So they don't think for themselves.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm thinking for myself and for my country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He seems to be saying that there is cheating going on with mail-in ballots here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And you can see that, you know, former President Trump's got the rallies and he's got the microphone and he's got the audiences and he can spread his message to thousands if not millions of people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I understand that he's a sore loser.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Hours after the polls closed, then President Trump demanded the counting stop.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, look, an NBC national news poll put Kamala Harris's favorability jumping 16 points since July.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yes, that's massive, what do you put that down to: well, you know, the book on Kamala Harris was that she was a do-nothing vice president, that the White House itself didn't trust her, and that she was harsh.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's very good out there, plus, let's admit it, she's gotten a bit of a nice honeymoon from the press.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Oh, she absolutely has, i think the mainstream left-wing media has a fair bit to do with that.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I think she is not only doing a great job of kind of getting the band back together, right, getting the coalition back together.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But she's also playing on his side of the field.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The point is she's playing on their side of the field.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think she's got some momentum.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I think she's playing on his side of the field.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And of course, Donald Trump is the one that ripped away that freedom for millions of women here in Pennsylvania and across the country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Republicans certainly say this, that she's kind of right.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, I'm not sure if she's if the Republicans rhetoric is right and she's really behind.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, Scott Perry, literally after the mob was cleared from the state Capitol on January 6th, he went to the well of the House of Representatives, rose to his feet, sought recognition from the chair of the House of Representatives at the time, and proceeded to say that the votes of the good people of Pennsylvania should be thrown out because Donald Trump told him to say that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And yet he went to the floor of the House of Representatives to say, wait, my election counts.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Sexton says she's finding suburban voters who are motivated by protecting abortion rights and keeping former President Donald Trump out of office.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump was in Pennsylvania a few weeks ago for a fundraiser outside Philadelphia and to hold one of his traditional rallies in Lehigh County, an area Biden won by seven points in 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"New reports, meanwhile, say that Harris' team is getting nervous over Trump's gains just 18 days out from the election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The New York Post reporting that Democrats in Pennsylvania, that all-important state, say that Harris is, quote, AWOL in being out message.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So both Alyssa Slotkin, who's running for Senate as a Democrat, and Kamala Harris have said both, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now she's backing off on them a little bit like she's doing with fracking because she wants to get elected.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so you have the unionized workers there saying, the union's saying, if we don't get that handout from the IRA, if that goes away under a Trump presidency, jobs are going to be lost.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But that's so short sighted and they're not looking at the long term and what will come because with Kamala Harris presidency will come these EV mandates and it will be a long term demise of the auto industry.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This is the average, and what you see nationally is Kamala Harris with a 1.6 percent lead.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, and listen, I was on I was on the air here saying some of the Trump tariffs were good.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And this was something that was not at least she wanted to ban fracking and then pivoted.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Oh, wait, because she has to win votes.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It was it was nine million barrels a day under Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But the vast majority of oil production has come from what are called ducks, drilled, but uncompleted wells, which were drilled before Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that's why we have this, biden Harris is a benefit of the ingenuity of the private sector, their own incompetence notwithstanding.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So we've seen a trend from the beginning of Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But Harris has not performed, people were waiting, including after the debate, thinking, well, at the debate, we'll get some specifics.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They also got nervous, too, when she failed to get some of the key endorsements from some of the organized unions that Joe Biden got before.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I'm pretty sure if Trump were sitting here now, he would say, you can take those endorsements.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Inside team Harris's unusual levels of finger pointing, which is very typical for these people, where there's no leadership at all.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He said she's an African-American woman who won office last year on a tough on crime message and would help Harris went over disillusioned black voters and working class white men.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now the Harris campaign provided a list of Politico of several examples of surrogate events aimed at engaging voters of color.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But of course, Latinos con Harris, the whole thing is just a disaster.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now he said Democrats complaints are a reflection of their anxiety over a tight race.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Everybody's very nervous, he said.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Why does Charlemagne talk crap about Harris with Andrew Schultz, but not to her face, who else here immediately came to the comments to see him: i don't want to hear her cackling for four more years, someone says.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But let's see where this goes, because Kamala gets asked about reparations.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And it's not good news for Kamala Harris and the Democrats.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But can she actually pull it off, can Harris secure Pennsylvania and push herself past the finish line in this nail-biting election: now, back to Pennsylvania's pivotal role.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A recent Emerson College poll from October 1, 2024, had both candidates at 48 percent, while a Bloomberg-Sawanar Morning Consult poll found Harris ahead by 5 points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump, meanwhile, is fighting to repeat his unexpected 2016 victory here when he became the first Republican in decades to win Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"While Trump still holds considerable sway over Pennsylvania's large white working-class population, 75 percent of the state identifies as non-Hispanic white.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris is proving to be a formidable opponent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The question still stands, will this early voting surge be enough for Harris to secure a win in Pennsylvania: we can't talk about Pennsylvania without discussing its significance in the electoral landscape.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Silver's model also predicts that Harris has an 88.8% chance of winning the entire election if she takes Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"On the flip side, Trump has a 92.4% chance of winning the election if he flips Pennsylvania back to red.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"For Trump, Pennsylvania holds personal significance.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, Trump's appeal to this demographic isn't the slam dunk it used to be.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She also held a bus tour through western Pennsylvania, even making a snack stop at a local Sheetz gas station.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her multiple trips to Pennsylvania, particularly to Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, are designed to keep Democratic voters energized.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The question is whether that enthusiasm will translate into enough votes to offset Harris' early voting lead.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If Harris wins Pennsylvania, her path to the White House becomes much clearer.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If the trend holds and Harris secures Pennsylvania along with Michigan and Wisconsin, she is all but guaranteed to win the presidency.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But it's not just Harris who needs Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump's path to victory also runs through the Keystone State.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump and his allies have reserved over $64 million worth of TV ads in Pennsylvania between September 10th and Election Day.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, can Kamala Harris win Pennsylvania: early voting dominance suggests she's on the right track, but the race is far from over.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Compared to our August, when 46 percent had her favorable, 48 percent unfavorable, that is now flipped.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Favorability, the catch-all for what voters think about the candidates from policy to personality to promise, tips Harris way since we last polled Pennsylvanians.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now we go to the average on real clear politics where Kamala Harris, thanks to this Quinnipiac poll, has now actually taken a lead in the Pennsylvania average, up to 0.6 percent now.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump was up 0.2 percent before this poll came out.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is down to 47.7, pennsylvania has been back and forth for the last few days, a few weeks now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trafalgar had Trump up two.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
USA Today and Suffolk had Harris up three.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Insider Advantage had Trump plus two.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then Quinnipiac so far has been the biggest margin for either candidate at Harris plus five.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And to be quite honest, I'm not really too sure what to make of this poll because I don't think there's, I don't think Kamala Harris, even if she has a good night on election night, I don't think she's going to win Pennsylvania by five percentage points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I could certainly see Harris, if she wins the state, getting 50 to 51 percent of the vote though.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I question Trump's support at 46 percent.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The final poll at 51, Biden got 50, so that was pretty accurate, but very much underestimated Trump support in Pennsylvania enough where Trump was able to pick up about five, six percentage points from where the poll was.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"On the pathway to 270, Harris is 226.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But Trump is polling better in Pennsylvania than he is in Michigan.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So that's all coming up later today, we're also going to talk about those Trump tapes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Over the weekend, the Trump campaign claimed it was recently hacked, and it's now blaming Iran for the data breach.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Trump campaign, let's start there, claims that it was hacked.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Ed, over the weekend, Trump claimed photos of crowds at Harris's rally were AI generated.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Do we have a sense of the strategy here, what is Trump hoping to achieve: it's unclear, Chanel.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Good to have that context there, at Harris's rally this weekend, she said her administration would get rid of attacks on tips for service workers.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Is Trump correct to say that she's copying her to some extent: sure.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But the Harris campaign can turn around and say, yeah, but you've said nothing about raising the minimum wage.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
New Hampshire's primary results do appear to have cemented Donald Trump's grip on the Republican Party.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They are the definition of die-hard Trump supporters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I believe that Donald Trump, for eight years, he's been attacked.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if he's elected president, I believe that he'll make policy change.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He'll secure our borders.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You heard some of his opponents during the last few months say the wall wasn't finished.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Does any of that reverberate with you, and you wonder, can he get it done if he wins a second term: he can get it done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, he's not a career politician.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He is a, you know, businessman.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And you might not always like the way he says things, but he gets things done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"They want to make, he wants to make the country great again.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He wants to make it great.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's not with the status quo.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he's actually for the people.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so I feel as though Donald Trump, he's not the silver bullet that's going to save the country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But voting for that man and having him elected back into office is the step that we need to take to fix, to make this country great.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And you think Donald Trump can change that, and do you blame Joe Biden for that: well, it's, I don't blame Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"A lifelong Republican, Jim Vinop, says Trump hasn't let him down.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When he came down the escalator, I thought, oh, this is crazy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, this guy, he'll never get anywhere.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, as things went on, I became a die-hard Donald Trump fan.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump does what he says.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The only reason he didn't get a lot more done is because they gave him grief every minute of every day.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What was it and what is it about him, has he made mistakes: oh, my goodness.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You've also heard, though, from former generals, from John Kelly, who was his chief of staff, say he would never, ever vote for Donald Trump again because of the way he treated veterans.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You heard from other, and you said that and he hugged the American flag.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But you've heard what he said through those people about the military, about wounded veterans, about Normandy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That doesn't bother you, yeah, things he has said bother me.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Am I giving him carte blanche, he can do anything he wants: no, no, absolutely not.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, I've said many times, geez, I wish he hadn't said that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And these were people that he put his trust in.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You said something that interested me, which is Donald Trump cares about me.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Not only do these voters dismiss Trump's many legal challenges.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"They stand by Trump's false claim that Joe Biden lost the 2020 election, even if it takes a minute.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You have certainly heard people who do not like Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Today is Saturday, August 10th, 2024, and this morning, the New York Times and Sienna College released an A plus poll across three battleground states, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, showing Kamala Harris with a four-point lead in every single battleground state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
There's enough electoral map math there that makes it so that these states could truly be the ones that hand Kamala Harris the presidency.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It means that you're already at a majority and that people just moving over narrowly between now and the election can put you over that majority denying any chance that Donald Trump would win by a plurality, vote splitting, whatever it might be.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"These are defining numbers that are very, very positive for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But absolutely explains why people, you know, choosing someone like Tim Walz was a good choice, why Kamala Harris being the replacement nominee for it was a good choice.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So before this poll was released, Harris was up by one point on average.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"0.9 percent lead for Kamala Harris, that will undoubtedly jump up.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And in Michigan, Kamala Harris ahead by two, again, New York Times and Sienna College poll not included on this average here, point being a two-point lead then will likely turn into three-point lead.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right now, the unfavorability numbers are just 5.6 percent higher than the favorability rating numbers, which is a massive, massive turnaround for Kamala Harris from where she was before.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For the entire duration of the presidency, with the exception of this honeymoon period, from January 2021 to July 2021, Kamala Harris has been disapproved of quite tremendously.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
More and more people started to dislike Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It started to get worse, negative double digits approval throughout nearly the entirety of her vice presidency, and it really didn't get better.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The majority of the nation had an unfavorable view of Kamala Harris, roughly a third of the nation, just a third, had a favorable view of Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so to see this massive, massive overturn from where it was before, again, day of the dropout, we saw Kamala Harris down nearly 20 points nationally.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Today, she is down just five.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And 43 percent of the nation has a favorable view of Kamala Harris that is the highest it has been since July 20th of 2021.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So massive, massive gains here, sorry, July 2021, not July 20th, massive gains for Kamala Harris and overall approval, and so being down again, 5.6 percent also means that the unfavorability rating has now dropped below 50 percent, meaning the majority of the nation no longer views Kamala Harris as unfavorable.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
What you're seeing here is that 8.2 percent more people have an unfair 8.2 percent delta between the unfavorable and favorable numbers for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's getting better for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You can see when it was a Biden versus Trump rematch, we saw that Biden was down nationally, two, three points on average.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Today, she's up by two.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She spoke directly to the people.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She had the ability to reshape the way that Americans viewed her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And it worked, and by the time we reached the election, she became someone with a positive approval rating.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And based on what we are seeing right now, it is very possible that she is turning it around as well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
There are so many different metric points that tell us right now Kamala Harris is in fact turning around this election and the New York Times poll today only affirms that point even more.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And so they also published an article talking about the worst three weeks of Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, Donald Trump had a very, very, very large amount of momentum going into Joe Biden dropping out.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There was so much around him, the assassination attempt, JD Vance announcement, the RNC had passed.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And so it looked like Donald Trump was unbeatable that this election would be one and done.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And since then, it has been the worst three weeks of Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that is resonating with voters, jD Vance and Donald Trump, on the other hand, really aren't.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, we've talked about how JD Vance was probably the worst pick that Donald Trump could have done for Vice President.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But but to that point, JD Vance is unpopular, so he doesn't provide a balance to Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But now not only is he not doing any harm, he's doing a lot of good for the Kamala Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so they also found that amongst voter demographics, Kamala Harris performed better than Biden did with key Democratic coalitions, doing better amongst black voters in these swing states and younger voters, and also gaining ground with older voters that can explain why Kamala Harris is ahead by four points when Biden only won Wisconsin by one, or Pennsylvania by one, or Michigan by three.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There are a lot of reasons to believe that Bob Casey is in a position where he could help Kamala Harris, that Tammy Baldwin is in a position where she could help Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's actually performing roughly even with where Kamala Harris is, but that's an open race, and it's not a popular incumbent and a lesser known name than you know, how Senator Tim Baldwin is taking Wisconsin and Senator Bob Casey in his state of Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that's actually good news for Donald Trump's campaign, because it means this election is by no means over.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And right now, every data point is suggesting that Kamala Harris is taking it out of the park.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's doing really well, hitting it out of the park.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The Trump hat, but here's the full video, uh, and the full context.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, pause, okay, so now, once you see that, I think it's clear, like secretly right now, Kamala Harris is screaming after her fifth glass of Chardonnay into a pillow right now, screaming at the top of her lungs.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's ironic because Obama definitely hates Biden and now Biden, I think definitely hates Kamala.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Hey Joe, how many times have you seen Jill Biden give a speech about Kamala: no, never.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump had a four point lead there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now it's basically tied Harris with a small margin there.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Those are voters that Donald Trump hasn't had great success with.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So it's just two states, they essentially have to win to do this.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So again, that's a state where you're gonna see the Harris campaign put a lot of effort into playing defense.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has picked a governor as her running mate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Shapiro for his part says he's grateful to have had the opportunity to speak with Harris about her vision for the campaign ahead, but is excited to continue working to deliver results for Pennsylvanians as governor.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She was seen talking, even hugging, a lot of voters there inside those stores.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's there because she wants to boost her platform of small businesses.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump, meanwhile, you can see him right here behind us, behind bulletproof glass.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
