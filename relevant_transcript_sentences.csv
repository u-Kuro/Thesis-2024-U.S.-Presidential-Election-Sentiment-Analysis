Maybe they think orange man bad.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'federman', 'oz oz', 'john federman', 'mccormick', 'oz trump', 'oz election', 'oz campaign']"

And that might be the pro of Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'federman', 'oz oz', 'john federman', 'mccormick', 'oz trump', 'oz election', 'oz campaign']"

And it was that Dr. Oz that beat him out.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'federman', 'oz oz', 'john federman', 'mccormick', 'oz trump', 'oz election', 'oz campaign']"
"Interestingly enough, one of the reasons that Trump says he endorsed Oz, even though, as you point out, he's probably to use a MAGA word squishy on a couple of their issues, transgender issues being among them, is he thinks that Oz will do better in a general election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'federman', 'oz oz', 'john federman', 'mccormick', 'oz trump', 'oz election', 'oz campaign']"

He ended up winning only by about 1.2 So you have to be aware of that error And so I think she really needs to get this number up if she wants to win I think she will I think the DNC boost would probably kick in and there'll be some of those kinds of boost still out there But you know what we can see if we go down these polls A lot of these polls don't actually contain him But like this signal poll has him at 2% which is really significant like 2% is absolutely massive.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['boost', 'president error', 'death sentence', 'aggregate august', 'things approval', 'something cnn', 'boost polls', 'trump death', 'tie issues', 'boost kinds']"

We're killing her in the polls.,Donald Trump,Michigan,"['boost', 'president error', 'death sentence', 'aggregate august', 'things approval', 'something cnn', 'boost polls', 'trump death', 'tie issues', 'boost kinds']"
She's got the lowest ever polling for things like that.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['boost', 'president error', 'death sentence', 'aggregate august', 'things approval', 'something cnn', 'boost polls', 'trump death', 'tie issues', 'boost kinds']"

And I'm wondering what her campaign thinks about it as well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"
But but the point is she she has no appeal to Catholic voters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"

It's not enough for me to decide whether or not I'm gonna vote for her.,Donald Trump,Michigan,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"
She needs to convince them that she's not just another politician making empty promises.,Donald Trump,Michigan,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"
Yeah and yet she's changed her position I know on issues like abortion a number of times which also speaks to what you talk about in terms of authenticity and trying to connect with voters who don't know really what she represents.,Donald Trump,Arizona,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"
She's she's been making a pretty direct appeals to that subset of voters.,Donald Trump,Michigan,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"
Why is her campaign focusing on this voting group?,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"
She's not energizing voters.,Donald Trump,Arizona,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"

And so her campaign is trying to make her available much more in the battleground states.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"
"At the same time, she does have to run a centrist course.",Donald Trump,Michigan,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"
She is really going to have to pull it out first in early voting and then hope that the election day turnout is in her favor.,Donald Trump,Arizona,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"

But Donald Trump edges her out in those two issues.,Donald Trump,Michigan,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"

"President Trump for something that took place months ago is basically her way of saying that President Trump has more power outside the White House than she has in the White House, which makes us question why would anyone want to support her in the first place?",Donald Trump,Arizona,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"
And I think that's a good kind of target demo for her to kind of squeeze out a couple more votes as we're looking at a really close race.,Donald Trump,Arizona,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"

The challenge for her will be to fill in the blanks that voters have about her.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"
Her campaign now says that she supports.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['candidate', 'people vision', 'policy', 'trump date', 'candidate change', 'way campaign', 'campaign', 'campaign manager', 'voters campaign', 'league']"

yet look Michiganders in the eye and say I'm doing right by you as the top lawyer top cop in in Michigan she indicts and she indicts just the fake electors she doesn't make it a broader a broader conspiracy though she could have and brought in everybody else including Donald Trump and John Eastman of Rudy Giuliani and everybody else she didn't do that she focused uniquely on just her citizens her residents of Michigan and brought a count or so against each one of them and that's the way she can maintain her own case at the same time Jack Smith goes after Donald Trump and the others and the other states this could be a model for the other states we're seeing for instance in Arizona the Attorney General doing about the same thing she's just further behind she's not ready to indict she's developing her evidence but I expect now based on you know Dana Nessel breaking that glass ceiling of prosecutors state prosecutors others will do the same thing because they'll say it can be it can be plus it can be two it doesn't have to be well we have to wait to see what the feds do about our own criminals in our own midst we can do it too I think this is going to be a real blueprint and a

house of Michigan even the leadership in the state house the speaker of the house for Michigan right and also the majority leader for Michigan went in November 20th of that year to the White House to meet with Donald Trump and they came away and issued a press statement that said yeah yeah we met with the president but we didn't really see anything that indicates that this wasn't a fair election or that anything was unfair about Michigan or that its votes should go somewhere else well apparently 16 people that met in the basement of the GOP headquarters and you can't make this stuff up thought otherwise they thought there was a way to steal the election from Joe Biden and undercut the will of the people in their own state and hand deliver the the the presidency to the person that they wanted not the people that michigan michigan people wanted but even the leadership in the state house thought that was crazy uh but wasn't crazy enough for these people who are these people well let's just run it down Kathy Bearden age 70 Hank Chote 72 Amy Fachinello 55 Clifford Frost 75 Stanley Grot 71 John Haggard 82 Mary Ann Henry 65 Tim King 56 I'm reading out there their ages so you know these aren't children these people know better you know these are you know 50 60 70 and 80 year olds in in the state of Michigan Michelle Lundgren 73 Miss Shawn Maddock 55 James Renner 76 Myra Rodriguez 64 Rose Rook 81 Mary Ann Sheridan 69 Ken Thompson 68 Kent Vanderwood 69 and of the 16 I just mentioned two in particular Kathy Bearden is on the Republican National Committee and his close friends with its chairperson Rona McDaniel Mitt Romney's niece and Michelle Maddock former co-chair of the Michigan GOP you have been indicted by your attorney general and here here is the indictment everybody gets the same swag bag from the attorney general Nessel everybody gets that I just listed one count of conspiracy to commit forgery which is a 14 year possible felony two counts of forgery a 14 year felony one count of conspiracy to commit uttering and publishing usually means a false statement a 14 year felony one count of uttering and publishing a false statement another 14 year felony one count of conspiracy to commit election law forgery a five-year felony and two counts of election law forgery a five-year felony and the the attorney general's office we we've heard her statement at the top of this hot take of attorney general Nessel but they went on to say in a written press statement that the false electors actions undermine the public's faith in the integrity of our elections and we believe also plainly violated the laws by which we administer our elections in Michigan my department meaning the attorney general of Michigan's department has prosecuted numerous cases cases of election law violations throughout my tenure and it would be malfeasance for the greatest magnitude of the greatest magnitude if my department failed to act here in the face of overwhelming evidence of an organized effort to circumvent the lawfully cast ballots of millions of Michigan voters in a presidential election couldn't have said it any better than attorney general Nessel I don't think this is going to be the end I think this is the blueprint all attorney generals in the battleground states can use to both establish their own territory get their own piece of turf and real estate to go after their citizens involved in the fake electors and kind of stay away from this sprawling more conspiracy oriented set of charges and indictments brought by either Jack Smith which would include Donald Trump and or Fawny Willis the Fulton County DA who is also looking at places like Michigan and the as part of her conspiracy but this is a perfect thread the needle right this is putting a camel through the eye of the needle in the form of let's just go after our state's bad people alleged bad people and we'll do that and we'll stay away from Jack Smith's prosecution and we can live harmoniously side by side as parallel prosecutors and that's that's what attorney generals who are the top prosecutors for each state can do if you do it the way that attorney general Nessel did I'll follow on breaking news and otherwise an analysis developments just like this one at the intersection of US law and politics here only on the Midas Touch Network I do
