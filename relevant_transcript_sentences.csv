Now what will happen is throughout the whole night on election night every single one of these counties will be all of them through all state they will be reporting in their election counts from all of the polling stations and all of these counties over here will be the first to report in and so as you're watching whatever station they'll be showing that Pennsylvania is red red red red red and everybody will start freaking out and that's because so many of these counties are reporting in and they're all reporting in huge numbers for Donald Trump but here's what you have to understand about Pennsylvania is that the total vote count in Pennsylvania in 2020 was about 6.9 million total votes cast and 43.2 percent of them came from this county and these counties right here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['pennsylvania', 'trump pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania trump', 'election pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania state', 'pennsylvania election', 'pennsylvania point', 'pennsylvania battleground', 'biden pennsylvania']"
Now these counties here will report in earlier than Philadelphia because there are fewer people here than there are in Philadelphia and the thing to note is of all of these votes here in Allegheny in 2020 almost 65% of them went for Biden in this whole section here including Philadelphia it was about 66% of all the votes from this area went for Biden but in Philadelphia which is included in this number of the 66% but if you take this out and just look at Philadelphia 80% of the votes coming out of Philadelphia went to Biden and so when you look at 43% of all of the votes cast in Pennsylvania are coming from these two areas and that roughly 65% of all of those votes went to Biden it means that the state goes to the Democrat it's just the way that the numbers work out especially if there is a significant increase in the number of people voting in this area especially in Philadelphia and also over here in Allegheny which we expect to have happened in this election so come November when you're watching the election returns you are going to relax take a deep breath get out your popcorn and whatever adult beverages you might be consuming that night and you will just sit and watch the returns coming in from Pennsylvania and you will not care what is happening for the whole state of Pennsylvania until the Philadelphia metropolitan area starts reporting in and Allegheny County because between those two areas that is 40 it's going to be 43% of the vote and in fact I would say with the increase in voter participation for this particular election it could be anywhere from 45 46 48 percent of the entire vote coming out of those two areas and because the majority of the voters are voting for the Democrat this is why I predict Kamala Harris is taking Pennsylvania in this election it's just about the math,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['pennsylvania', 'trump pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania trump', 'election pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania state', 'pennsylvania election', 'pennsylvania point', 'pennsylvania battleground', 'biden pennsylvania']"

But let's take Pennsylvania out of Kamala Harris's column and put him in a Donald Trump's column.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania kamala', 'pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania harris', 'state pennsylvania', 'josh shapiro', 'pennsylvania governor', 'josh', 'campaign pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania candidates']"

"So the ad emphasizes he's bashing by it and not directly Harris, but he's running to Trump and that is a concerning sign for Kamala Harris because He literally praised basically praise Trump a little bit in a sense in that ad and that was just striking to me and maybe it shows his internals that Kamala has some Pennsylvania problem that we're even seeing reflected in the polling average a bit to the point where It's I mean alarm bells for Kamala Harris like look at the election shuffle.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania kamala', 'pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania harris', 'state pennsylvania', 'josh shapiro', 'pennsylvania governor', 'josh', 'campaign pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania candidates']"

And so you will find that this Democratic sponsored poll probably is misleading in the sense that Kamala Harris is probably not up four points in Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania kamala', 'pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania harris', 'state pennsylvania', 'josh shapiro', 'pennsylvania governor', 'josh', 'campaign pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania candidates']"
"Well, one of the big issues the article points to is the campaign's leadership in Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania,"['harris pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania kamala', 'pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania harris', 'state pennsylvania', 'josh shapiro', 'pennsylvania governor', 'josh', 'campaign pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania candidates']"
Now we have a new poll from the New York Times with Sienna College this is an A plus rated pollster apparently the best the best even though their polls are all over the place that this election season but they show Kamala Harris with a four point lead when you don't round out the results over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania when you round these are the numbers that they give us it is 50% for Kamala Harris 47% for Donald Trump a three point lead when rounded when you unround Trump falls down to 46% which gives her a very impressive four point lead in Pennsylvania and you will look at why this four point lead is so important not to mention Arizona of course while we have this poll up Donald Trump really expanding his lead in Arizona to now a 6% margin very impressive for him but we you know we really have had this common consensus now for quite a while now for months now that Donald Trump will carry the state of Arizona as well as other Sun Belt states but Pennsylvania is the important one here Arizona only has 11 electoral votes Pennsylvania has 19 in such a close race like this that eight more from Pennsylvania sorry yeah eight more on that really does matter a lot so that four point lead is important because we always talk about you know how much are the polls overestimated Joe Biden in the 2020 election right because when you look at 2020 he was expected to win by only four point seven percent and I say only because take that with with a state like Wisconsin in 2020 where Joe Biden was expected to win in the polls on election day by eight point four percent he only won it by point six so he was overestimated basically eight percent almost in the state of Wisconsin while you head over to Pennsylvania again he was expected to win by four point seven he won it by one point two so he was only over estimated here by some three and a half percent so to see Kamala Harris with the four point lead on rounded in Pennsylvania that's big because I do want to preface this with saying that I don't think that Kamala Harris will be overestimated in the polls at all I currently think that she will be underestimated in the polling so even if she is overestimated as much as Joe Biden was in the 2020 election in Pennsylvania she still wins again Biden was overestimated by three and a half percent in Pennsylvania when you do the math Harris has a four point lead currently she would still win the state by a very narrow margin so Pennsylvania is hugely important right you know so that was just to show you know how important this single poll is considering that it isn't a plus pollster but now we have to talk about Pennsylvania because the fact that the fact the matter is she is running away with Pennsylvania it's a very narrow lead um in in of court like the average I'm in the aggregate of polls um which is expected and again I don't I do think that Harris will outpace what polls are expecting I really do because poll stars are pollsters are worried about underestimating the Trump factor once again and everything like that so they are really boosting Trump's are they're giving an emphasis on Trump areas because they're you know the polling industry is you know going down right now in the dumps um so again they're really trying to get it accurate this time not underestimate Trump ultimately I think that Harris is being underestimated now just like 2022 the Democrats were but when it comes to the average you can see Harris has never let up once in the state of Pennsylvania that's insane that is absolutely insane Harris has kept a lead in Pennsylvania this entire race now let's compare that to a state like North Carolina for a moment we see we see um in the beginning of the race Trump had a pretty steady lead then Harris took the lead for a moment there for literally like two days then he was even then Trump took the back the lead then it was even again Trump took the lead Harris took the lead by point to Trump took the lead Harris took the lead Trump took the lead again Harris took the lead Trump took the lead and he still has the lead less than 1% this is the case and this is the most extreme case but this is a case that's going that's happening with many many many battleground states Michigan not Michigan sorry Wisconsin Nevada especially Arizona Georgia for sure but what you notice is that it's not happening in Pennsylvania and that's important the fact that there is a common consensus in the polling numbers is important fact that common layers is a clear leader is a clear favorite to win in Pennsylvania that's important let's just take a look at at the 538 forecast here let's I don't know what they are currently projected to be honest um they say that the presidential race is extremely narrow but I assume they say of course that Harris is favored to win in Pennsylvania you can see there she has a 52 to 48 percent chance of winning the state but looking at Pennsylvania specifically again it is so incredibly important that Kamala Harris does have a lock on Pennsylvania that's what I've been saying for a while when you look at the electoral map Pennsylvania proves to be extremely important this is my forecast that's the map these are all the numbers this is how I think that the election will go if it were held today or tomorrow or whatever so Pennsylvania is critical obviously to Kamala Harris on now if Trump does win Pennsylvania Kamala Harris actually still wins the election however she then has literally zero wiggle room the only place that she could lose is Nebraska second district resulting in her still winning the election even if she loses just Nevada on top of that you know just two slight changes in my forecast then she loses the election 267 to 271 however however North Carolina is basically toss-up I have a Harris plus 0.1 percent because I don't know it's too hard to tell there are too many factors Mark Robinson being on the ballot the state shifting left rapidly right now there are so many factors to consider North Carolina it's virtually toss-up I think that Harris wins by honestly a few thousand votes so look I would not be surprised in the slightest if Trump wins North Carolina because the odds really are 50-50 in my forecast right now considering that margin of Harris plus 0.1 so if North Carolina does go red which you say I'm on a chance that it goes red as it goes blue then she can't lose Pennsylvania then she has to hold Pennsylvania so the fact that she as I outlined she is you know she has this sort of lock on Pennsylvania right now as she has had throughout this race that's important because it is critical to her path to victory then if she holds Pennsylvania she could even lose Nevada Nevada could even go to Donald Trump and it could still result in a 270 win for Harrison walls 270 is the minimum you need to win the presidency that is just two electoral votes up against Trump and Vance so North Carolina and Nevada could easily go Republican but as long as she has Pennsylvania she wins the election and she holds the other blue wall states now what if Trump wins Pennsylvania it's you know obviously it's important to Harris's victory but if Trump is going to win the election of course I really think that you know he might need Pennsylvania however that he doesn't need it he could he could simply just run the Sun Belt North Carolina Georgia Arizona Nevada and then flip Wisconsin I think that Wisconsin will be closer than Pennsylvania so that of course can absolutely happen but if Pennsylvania does go red it really opens the door for Donald Trump if he wins the Sun Belt plus Pennsylvania he's at 287 17 more than he needs then he could even lose North Carolina and he still wins the election or he could actually lose he could even lose Nevada and Arizona and he still wins the election 270 to 268 so you know Pennsylvania everything weighs on Pennsylvania almost Donald Trump and Kamala Harris still paths to victory especially Trump Trump still has a path to victory without Pennsylvania however Pennsylvania is one of the most likely states to go to either candidate because of how split it is right now so it's very good for Kamala Harris when she gets polls like this which shows her from an A plus pollster with a pretty steady lead in the most critical battleground state Pennsylvania and again I think that she will win it Joe Biden won it by 1.2% in 2020 and what we have seen is a massive left-word trend in the suburbs the suburbs that dominate Pennsylvania elections and we are seeing massive left-ward trends across suburbs or in suburbs across the nation so if Pennsylvania can continue to trend to the left then the Democrats are in for a really good result in Pennsylvania so look at this Chester County Pennsylvania vote for Mitt Romney in 2012 by 0.2% he lost the state Obama won the state by 5% fast forward four years later Chester County went from 0.2 for Romney to 10 for Hillary Clinton now Donald Trump won the state so while the state as a whole trended seven points or six points I should say towards the Republicans Chester County became ten points more Democratic that you never see furthermore he went from ten points in 2016 to a stunning 17 points for Biden in 2020 suburbs eight Donald Trump and I believe that now more than ever with someone like Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket for the Democrats she will be able to really continue this trend possibly you know trend it more these at least Chester County trend it more towards the Democrats than we have seen in past elections in 2016 and 2020 so that's the state of the race right now in Pennsylvania hugely important state Kamala Harris definitely favored to win so thank you all
