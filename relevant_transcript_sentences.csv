Sentence,Presidential_Candidate,State
Are you a previous Trump supporter: the first year he won in 2016 I was not.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Okay, then what happened: and then I just felt like he did a good job.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I like the fact that he was not a politician.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Oh absolutely, small business owner Andrew Cingrati backs Trump too.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Before Harris stepped in I thought it was going to be like almost a slam dunk.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"No, I'm not so sure, retiree John Brady is backing Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Would you say Harris excites you in any way: i like her optimism.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She reflects more of what I see.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Both friends are backing Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't like him as a person.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But I think he's the best thing for the country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
How will you feel if Trump doesn't win: petrified.,Donald Trump,Michigan
You see Obama won Eaton County twice so did Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But Trump's 2020 margin was less than 1 percent and when I say less than 1 percent I mean 499 votes.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Retired nurse Paul Mudri is a Reagan Democrat who backs Vice President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's raising all this money all these volunteers it's in the bag.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Sloan Davis is part of the Harris coalition but half-heartedly.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I know Trump went down some very seemingly ridiculous rabbit holes about cats and everything else.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But that doesn't mean they don't still care about immigration and will not still continue to back Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Kamala Harris leads in key battleground states Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, according to New Washington Post polls.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Despite a tight race, Harris holds a narrow edge over Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Soon after the United States' Congressional midterm elections in November 2022, Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He quickly solidified his position as the front-runner, consistently garnering strong support among Republican voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In early August, Harris was officially nominated as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, following her victory in a virtual vote by party delegates.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
A fresh batch of polls conducted by the Washington Post has brought unexpected news for the Kamala Harris campaign in the 2024 presidential race.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris holds narrow leads in four critical battleground statesâ€”Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"These findings reveal a more competitive landscape than previously predicted, with Harris emerging as a serious contender despite earlier narratives suggesting the race was shifting in favor of Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"These polls are a significant development for Harris, whose campaign has faced skepticism regarding its ability to maintain voter support in these key states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump remains a strong force within his party, and the 538 forecast as of this morning shows him ahead with a 53-47 edge.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"However, these new high-quality polls reflect a shift in the narrative, showing Harris maintaining a competitive position.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"While it's too early to call any clear victories, these numbers show Harris with a narrow but crucial advantage in these swing states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"One of the key takeaways from the polls is Harris's success among young voters, particularly young women, who appear to be driving her lead in these battlegrounds.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The gender gap in this election has widened significantly, and Harris's support among young women, a demographic that has historically leaned democratic, is proving decisive.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"While Trump is performing well among young men, Harris's edge among young women has been enough to tilt the scales in her favor in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Let's continue, in addition to her appeal to young voters, Harris is resonating with voters on issues such as healthcare and abortion rights, areas where she is outperforming Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Despite not having overwhelmingly positive favorability ratings, her stance on these key issues is helping her win over voters who may have reservations about her candidacy, but are still aligning with her on policy grounds.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The economy remains a battleground where Trump and Harris are running close, but her advantage in other areas appears to be keeping her competitive in critical regions.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"While much of the media has painted a narrative favoring Donald Trump as the front-runner, recent high-quality polls tell a more nuanced story.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Georgia, which turned blue in the 2020 election, remains highly competitive, and Harris's advantage here could be a critical factor in her overall strategy.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris's slight lead here demonstrates her ability to connect with key voting blocs, particularly on issues like health care, abortion rights, and economic recoveryâ€”areas where she outperforms Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Meanwhile, Trump remains ahead in Arizona and North Carolina, where he holds a three-point lead in both states.",Donald Trump,Michigan
These states are just as crucial for Trump's electoral path as the Rust Belt states are for Harris.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Trump maintains these leads, they could offset Harris's strength in the Midwest.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris's strength in certain regions, combined with Trump's strongholds, suggests that the final outcome will hinge on the voter turnout and last-minute shifts in the remaining undecided voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
One of the key factors driving Harris's performance is her overwhelming support among young women.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"According to the Washington Post polls, the gender gap in this election is historically large, and Harris is benefiting from this divide.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"While Trump performs well among young men, Harris's support among young women is so strong that it more than offsets Trump's advantage.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Additionally, Harris is performing well on issues like health care and abortion.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Even in areas where Trump has traditionally been seen as stronger, such as the economy, Harris is running nearly even, suggesting a more nuanced voter sentiment than simply breaking along party lines.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris holds a slim but consistent lead in the Rust Belt states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which were crucial to Joe Biden's 2020 victory.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If she can maintain these leads, they could form a key part of her electoral firewall.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Conversely, Trump is ahead in Arizona by three points.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"These results suggest that while Harris is performing well in the Rust Belt and making gains in the Sun Belt, the race remains highly competitive, with neither candidate holding a decisive advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris had maintained a lead here throughout much of the campaign, but the latest data shows that the state has tightened.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Following Harris's entry into the race, there was a surge in voter registration, especially among black women, a demographic that has been a stronghold for the Democratic Party.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The Washington Post poll shows a close race overall, with Harris holding a narrow one-point advantage across the seven battleground states combined.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Meanwhile, her lead in Georgia and the Rust Belt states, though small, positions her well to potentially secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"With less than 14 days left until the election, these numbers suggest that the race remains fluid and that Harris is very much in the running.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"As we head into the final days of the campaign, the Harris team will likely focus heavily on voter mobilization in these battleground states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"With Trump still leading in states like Arizona and North Carolina, Harris cannot afford to lose ground in her strongest states, particularly in the Rust Belt in Georgia.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"For Trump, the challenge will be to maintain his leads in the Sun Belt while trying to chip away at Harris's advantage in the Rust Belt.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If he can flip any of these states, particularly Pennsylvania or Michigan, it could change the entire trajectory of the election.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Overall, the latest Washington Post polls show a highly competitive race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, with Harris holding small but significant leads in several key battleground states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"While Trump is performing well in Arizona and North Carolina, Harris is ahead in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, states that could be crucial to securing the presidency.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump said the tariff hikes on the income tax cuts as better to support manufacturing.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Rather than any political considerations, running in 2016, Trump narrowly won Michigan as a whole.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Wisconsin, Kamala Harris is in front.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And in Pennsylvania, again, by an absolute head breath in the Keystone State, Kamala Harris is ahead.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You can see on the basis of this result, Kamala Harris narrowly wins, but literally she's on the nose.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's on 270, and there's a particular peculiarity about this scenario, which is you can see here, this is the state of Nebraska.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Now to the most recent poll from Michigan State University showing Kamala Harris with roughly a 4.6% 4.7% lead across the battleground state.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now the nuclear politics average has Donald Trump up, the 538 average has Kamala Harris up, the 538 forecast has Kamala Harris up.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But generally speaking, the consensus is that Kamala Harris maintains a minor advantage in the state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"All around here, we're starting to see some more favorable numbers in the state that do in fact say, hey, wait a minute, Kamala Harris is actually in a position, sorry about that, my lord, just wanted to yell at me for a moment, but is in a position where she is doing actually better, actually better than many people, you know, would have you think based on the things you're seeing on Twitter, on Instagram, on TikTok, this race obviously is still competitive, and it absolutely is in no person's column, 100% guaranteed.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But a tied result is better than what again, the Republican Party and the mainstream press has been pushing is that Donald Trump is winning every battleground state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"She's no longer at that number, 226, which is where she was before, 241 from 226.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
You can even see Democrats across the country are just as inspired and find Kamala Harris to be as popular amongst the base as Obama was in 2008.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That's good for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's been polling better in Georgia recently as of late.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What does that mean for some other states: well, now she can afford to lose North Carolina.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now she can afford to lose Georgia, and she still wins the election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But in some of them too, reminding her that she's not in the majority just yet on average.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"When you take a look at what's expected of her in 538, even though she has a 55% chance of winning the electoral votes in Michigan, she's only barely at that majority mark, 50.3 to 49.7.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris leading in this battleground state is absolutely news.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Now I'm not gonna say they're giving up Michigan by any means.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But I think that also speaks to the range at which we could see Harris win by one, two, three points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Donald Trump, if he wants to win Pennsylvania, will likely do so by maybe one or two points at most.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Doesn't mean she would be guaranteed to win it, the answer is absolutely not.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And the last poll that was conducted was the Detroit Free Press that showed Donald Trump with a seven point lead across the state of massive, massive improvement for the former president in the state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
No guarantee that she wins Michigan at this point.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If there was ever a time for Kamala Harris to turn around a race, turn around some of these battlegrounds, that time would be now.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"President Trump can say whatever he wants, but his record is really clear for workers here in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And President Trump can say whatever he wants, but we've seen his record that has been disastrous for the auto industry.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So how does he fare any better in the fight of winning the union endorsement: well, I think the contrast is clear.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"With me, CNN's senior data reporter, professor of numbers, Harry Ettin, when we talk about Donald Trump from the beginning of Donald Trump as a political figure, non-college white voters, white voters who did not go to college, have been one of his key demographics.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And this is what's so interesting because we've seen so many groups this year moving in Donald Trump's direction.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So this is Trump's march with non-college white voters.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"You go back four years ago, he won him by 31.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's only up by 27, now that may not seem like a lot, but given that we're seeing these double digit gains, say, among black voters or among Hispanic voters in some of the polls, the fact that we're seeing this core group of supporters actually moving away from him, not just off of the 2016 baseline, but the 2020 baseline as well, I think that's a rather interesting development.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Shrinkage, as Donald Trump might say, based on what he said the last few days.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"All other groups, voters of color at 28 percent, so this is something that we've seen throughout the board, right: which is that Donald Trump is making huge gains with groups that make up a smaller percentage of the electorate while he's losing a little bit.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But these groups that he's losing a little bit of make up a much larger portion of the electorate.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump won him by 25.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump winning him by 22.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Again, Trump is ahead, but his margins are smaller.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And when you have a shrinking margin for Donald Trump among his core group that makes up the majority of voters, it can make up for big shifts among smaller groups of the electorate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And this is why Kamala Harris is still in the ballgame right now.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's because even though she's losing big league, she's losing big league among groups that make up a small portion of the electorate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And she's making it up among groups that make up a big portion of the electorate, even if the movements are small.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And if I can, yes, please, again, you know, as you're looking here, again, this is where Donald Trump has seen gains.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Was Donald Trump's 39 minute spontaneous dance party the closest we are getting to an October surprise: as both campaigns enter the home stretch, there will be no big final debate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump's made that clear, both campaigns now, of course, just focusing on turnout in swing states that will decide the election.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When the Harris campaign started off, that was just back in July.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But with the polls showing a dead heat, Harris and her running mate now attacking their opponent in more direct and stark terms.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Look, they pulled him out of interviews and his team admitted he's exhausted.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
He's nearly 80 years old.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's out there rambling, moving around, we'll give him a break.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But look, he's not up to this anymore, folks.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's not up to it.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Quote, Trump suddenly seems not just lazy, weak by dodging another debate, for instance, and old, but also truly out of it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Some days he makes it seem like the 25 in Project 2025 is a secret plan to execute the 25th Amendment if he actually gets elected, paving the way for Lord Help Us president J.D. Vance, joining us now is Mark McKinnon, the writer of that piece, former adviser to John McCain and George W. Bush.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's clearly trying to troll Vice President Harris over what she has made kind of a central piece of the biography she's trying to sell to voters.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But it's also a place that he obviously has loved in public for quite some time.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, he's still Trump, but he's you know, he's hanging out with McDonald's with real people, talking about stuff that real people like that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When when when it's all about turnout, what's key is enthusiasm, right, you know, whose voters are more excited about going out to vote: and Harris has like a 10 point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She also has about a 10 point advantage on women voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I think that she's going to win.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So just sort of counter to my own narrative, there's a reality out there that there are huge numbers of young men turning out for Trump and these Charlie Kirk campus rallies.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I think that's where Harris is going.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Again I take your point that you think Harris is on track to win here.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I'm not trying to take away from that at all, what do you think is going on with Harris people who are saying behind the scenes in a way.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And that's exactly what the Harris campaign is doing.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I think that Donald Trump would be a total disaster for our nation, and I cannot vote for him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So what's at stake for women if Donald Trump is our president: i think it's bad news for women.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I believe that a very normal Republican would generally not support Trump or anybody like him.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And if we go back to 2020, Trump won this county 69% and total votes 99,585.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that's probably going to help Harris, okay, I want to show you the electoral map.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And if you look at 538, their polling average, Harris has a slight advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So let's just say she's able to win Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If she wins Pennsylvania, then Georgia's not going to matter because she'll go over the 270.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She'll have 276, so that's something else that we're looking at.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now if Trump is able to pull out Pennsylvania, now Georgia matters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now he has to win Georgia in order to win, and Harris would have to win Georgia in order to win the presidency.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris is raising ungodly amounts of money here in Hasbun since she got in the race.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There's a wave, a Democratic wave going across the country as she's going around with all these events here.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Is it possible to keep this momentum going, what does she need to do to keep the momentum between now and November: i think that she keeps doing what she's doing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think that she's got a ton of momentum.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"People are excited, her message of hope and positiveness and what's right about the country is connecting with people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And Trump's coming in twice this week.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Former President Donald Trump has played in both an irrespective of your political perspective, be it Democrat, Republican or independent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It's pretty hard to argue his record isn't one and one.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump resoundingly defeated President Biden in June and one of the most anticipated political moments in recent memory.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"On Tuesday, Trump squared off against Vice President Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And again, no matter your politics, it's hard to have watched that and not to clear Harris the winner, at least poll after poll continues to show.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Vance and Trump will let Michigan manufacturing's plants close, just like Trump did.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They're gonna send us backwards.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"We can't go back, going back means cutting $500 million from the Lansing Grand River plant.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"We can't go back, i don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Don't let Trump and Vance throw it away.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Four years ago when Republican Mike Rogers said this about Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I think yesterday broke the spell that so many people had about Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Clearly his actions led to that, you know, what we, there's no great way to describe what happened yesterday, sedition.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"How many are fired up for another four years at Donald Trump: and as Trump maintains his tight grip over the GOP, the two have developed a deep alliance, as Rogers' fate appears tied to the former president in one of the nation's most important battlegrounds.",Donald Trump,Michigan
You even said that he was clearly responsible for the acts of January 6th.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Do you stand by any of those: well I didn't say he was clearly responsible, but here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But do you stand by any of the criticism that you had after 2020: even Donald Trump said I was tough, but fair.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She voted 100 percent with the Biden-Harris agenda.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But the truth is, I can have those conversations with Kamala Harris when we disagree.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Mike Rogers can't disagree with Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"As Trump was in Detroit earlier this month, he leveled this insult.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Were you OK with what he said, you know what: this is interesting.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now what he was talking about is there are schools that are failing, and the Democrats every year keep saying, I'm going to help you.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Everyone who used to be thoughtful and independent just either has to get with Trump and salute and do anything he says, or they can't be in politics.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The week we traveled to Dearborn, the city was hosting ArabCon.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Obviously, to state that Donald Trump only won by 10,000 votes in 2016, and we just saw 101,000 people vote uncommitted.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"She ended up losing to Donald Trump by 10,000 votes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now, a recent national poll puts Kamala Harris' support with the Muslim community at 30%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, the Arab and Muslim community knows very well what a Trump presidency looks like.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Many people in this community were impacted by the Trump presidency.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He is a threat to our country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's a threat to our democracy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"In my heart, I don't want Trump to win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I think he's not just a disaster for Arab-Americans, but he's also a disaster for all Americans.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Ali's family history is deeply tied to Michigan's labor unions, which are known for having a significant influence on the outcome of elections.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The union endorsed Kamala Harris for president, but also called for a permanent ceasefire in Palestine and Israel.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And at the same time, I think Donald Trump would be disastrous for our country.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's my main issue, do I want to stop Donald Trump from becoming president again, or do I want to, you know, vote my conscience and demonstrate also the power of the Arab American and Muslim vote: that feeling of uncertainty is present for Lexus and the uncommitted campaign as well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Harris does not move as it relates to policy, I cannot come out and endorse Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But as more and more Arab and Muslim voters stop being loyal to the Democratic Party, it could make Kamala Harris's path to the White House extremely difficult.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
You saw Donald Trump once tonight.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump is in legal trouble right now.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's in peril.,Donald Trump,Michigan
You told me that you're strong Trump supporter though.,Donald Trump,Michigan
You told me though you're a strong Trump supporter.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yes, sir, okay, and Del, final question for you, independent for Trump also, independent, yeah, for Trump, you supported Trump though.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But either way, you're a Trump supporter.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump appears to have some momentum in the polls, but the race is still very much within the margin of error.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But now six of those eight forecasts show Trump slightly favored to win.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I want to zero in on some of the efforts the Trump campaign is making, including a number of Trump allies, namely Elon Musk.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So Scott, moving to the Harris campaign, we've heard a lot of concerns in recent weeks about her weaknesses in the polls with young black and Latino men.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So how big of a problem does Harris have with young men: she has one.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Conversely, we see that she has got a pretty big lead and gap above Donald Trump among women.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Another demographic that Harris seems to have some issues with is Arab American voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump polls show that a sizable amount of Arab Americans are unhappy with the administration's handling of the war in Gaza and the war in the Middle East.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, look, that is not the number you want to see if you're the Harris camp out of Arab Americans, especially considering Donald Trump has gotten a few high profile endorsements among local Arab American community leaders.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She is doing better amongst women.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And so that's a little bit of the math in her favor.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"How much of this is about winning over Trump supporters: you could vote for Trump, but also vote for a Democrat at the Senate level.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Or is this about Harris being potentially toxic on some level to some of these swing voters: i think it's a little bit of both.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I mean, look, relatively speaking, she is a newer candidate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's only recently, a couple of weeks, she started to do interviews.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And you know, Donald Trump, he's been essentially running for president for 10 years.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She's not talking about the economy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's not talking about the border.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
But Donald Trump edges her out in those two issues.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"January 6th stuff, that's where she pulls better.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So she's at least going to close on the two issues that voters trust her and think she's best able to handle.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And if she could be an election spoiler, we know that back in 2016, she's been blamed in part for Hillary Clinton's loss.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's making a stop in Houston this week, calling Texas Ground Zero for Trump's abortion bans.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's also going to be campaigning with Beyonce herself, a Houston native.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But look, why is Harris heading to Texas right now, in addition to the other battleground states: i mean, Texas is a pretty red leaning state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Yeah, it's it's interesting to me, you know, Colin Allred in our forecast is an underdog there.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Armie, the left is in meltdown over new polling data showing that Donald Trump is gaining popularity among black and Hispanic voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So it looks like Trump will have the best performance with black voters since 1960.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Right now, Trump might get 50%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's right now pulling at close to 50% of the Hispanic vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Despite the fact that media, the media business continuously trying to call him his anti-Hispanic, right: that's all they do.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He hates immigrants.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He hates Hispanics.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that's why he might win close to 50% of the Hispanic vote, okay: this is not going well for them.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But right now, it is possible that Trump is gonna win 25% of the black vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Look, all of these things are coming together and creating absolute desperation and fear in the camp for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"How do we know that: because she's going on, she's going to the Death Star.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's going on to Fox News for an interview.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She is so desperate that she is, look, she can't handle friendly interviews, Rita.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"How is she gonna handle Bret Baier: and Bret Baier, by the way, is not an attack dog.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And she's not gonna handle that, she can't handle the view, Rita.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What is she gonna do: look, the polling is all trending away from her.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Right now in the Rust Belt, right: the three most important swing states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, right now, she's behind in all, he may sweep all three of them.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"In Wisconsin, which was kind of solidly in her camp.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Not by much, pretty solidly, in the last 10 polls that were done, she's only up in four of those polls.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"In Pennsylvania, in the last 10 polls, she's only up in two.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And in Michigan, which is probably the solid, most solid blue of those three, in the last 10 polls, she's only up by one.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's down statistically in all of those swing states.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And he could very well just be like a bad guy, but I'd be lying if, you know, like numbers don't lie.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If you look back, he's done a lot, especially, you know, in terms of employment and stuff.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's done a lot for, you know, like us, you know, under his administration.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think Trump's gonna win this election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I don't see this turning around anytime soon, unless there's some kind of massive mistake that he makes, which is always possible.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think Trump's gonna win.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So yes, I think that she is at risk for losing peace between swing states, especially in states like Michigan, where we have the largest concentration of Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, people who know firsthand the effects and the impact of American-funded bombing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Donald Trump, defying all expectations and predictions, managed to flip them red, securing a crucial victory.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"For Kamala Harris, these states represent both a formidable challenge and a significant opportunity to connect with voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"To secure the presidency, she'll need to win back voters who felt left behind by the Democratic Party's previous strategies and policies.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But beyond that, she'll also need to energize a base that is still reeling from the shock of 2016, reigniting their passion and commitment.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump's presidency, marked by controversy and division, has left the country deeply polarized.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"His supporters see him as a disruptor, a fighter for the forgotten man.",Donald Trump,Michigan
His detractors view him as a threat to democratic norms and institutions.,Donald Trump,Michigan
She must unite a fractured Democratic Party while also appealing to independents and disaffected Republicans.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump's strategy in the Midwest is no secret.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump's rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin are a familiar sight.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris faces an uphill battle in Michigan and Wisconsin.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She needs to convince voters that she understands their concerns and has a plan to address them.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She needs to articulate a clear vision for the future that resonates with their hopes and aspirations.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
One of her biggest challenges is overcoming the perception that she is a creature of the coastal elite.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She needs to connect with Midwestern voters on a personal level, showing them that she understands their values and shares their priorities.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She needs to convince them that she's not just another politician making empty promises.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She needs to show them that she's a leader who will fight for them, someone who will listen to their concerns and work to improve their lives.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Section 5, Republicans for Harris: in a surprising twist, Kamala Harris is receiving support from an unexpected quarter Republicans.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Many Republicans are appalled by his behavior, his policies, and his rhetoric.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If enough Republicans in key states like Michigan and Wisconsin decide to vote for Harris, it could be enough to tip the scales in her favor.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris will need to win back voters in the Milwaukee suburbs who flipped to Trump last time.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She'll also need to mobilize the Democratic base, particularly African-American voters in Milwaukee.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If she can peel away even a small percentage of Republican voters, it could be enough to swing the state in her favor.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But Trump's victory there in 2016, by a margin of less than 0.5%, shattered that perception.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris will need to win back blue-collar voters in Macomb County, a traditional bellwether for the state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She'll also need to generate enthusiasm among young voters and minority voters in Detroit.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"These crossover voters, turned off by Trump's rhetoric and policies, could be swayed by Harris's message of unity and her focus on issues like health care and climate change.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Section 11, the Long Game The 2024 election is more than just a referendum on Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It's a battle for the future of the Republican Party.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Will it remain the party of Trump, or will it chart a new course: the Republican support for Harris is a sign that some within the party are ready for a change.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Trump wins, it will embolden his wing of the party.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump lost the electoral college by an aggregate of somewhere between 45 and 60,000 votes last time.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He won in 2016 despite losing the popular vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Of course, in 2016, former President Trump, when he first won the White House, he cracked open that blue wall.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He was able to flip some of those states red.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The map gets so much harder, if not nearly impossible, for Harris if she loses Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So she needs to hold on to that blue wall in particular.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's why, of course, she is spending so much time there.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
A big day for her appearing for the first time alongside former First Lady Michelle Obama.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And Mary Alice, Trump taped an appearance, of course, on Joe Rogan's podcast, which we know is wildly popular, in particular with younger men.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Look, I'm not sure that this is Trump necessarily going hugely outside of his base.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump has been doing so well with men in this race, up nearly 10 points over Harris in some polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, of course, she's up with women by 10 points, but that gender gap is so apparent here.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It was a very interesting, very long interview with Joe Rogan, meandering at times, nearly three hours, talked about everything from life on Mars to mixed martial arts fighters, but also Trump repeating and getting pushed by Rogan on some of his election conspiracies and false claims about election security, Gio.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And now, obviously, Harris has been focusing on Trump as a, quote, threat to democracy.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And that's a big part of her closing argument.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"A lot of folks here in D.C. wondering if it's a little bit too much like 2016, a little too much like Hillary Clinton, too focused on Trump, not focused enough on what she wants to do, sort of a positive vision for the future.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump showing only a small margin of difference in recent opinion surveys.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is enjoying a slight lead in a recent CBS poll released on Sunday, which was conducted on more than 3,000 registered voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"In a poll conducted on voters from seven swing states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Nevada, Harris was ahead by one to two percentage points compared to the former president.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN to participate in another debate with her counterpart, as she is set to release new economic proposals this week.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"However, Trump has turned this down, meanwhile, in a recent appearance on TV, Trump stated that he will not run in the 2028 presidential elections if he loses.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If he wins this election in November, based on the constitution, he will be unable to run for a third term.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This implies that regardless of the election results, the 2024 election will be Trump's last.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump by less than half a percentage points based on 110 polls and decision desk HQ in the Hill's national average.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"47.6% to 47.2%, given the electoral college does structurally favour Republicans, this national lead would almost certainly not be enough for Harris to win 270 electoral votes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"As always, the key question remains, how are Trump and Harris performing against one another in the key battleground states: on your screen right now is the 2024 electoral college map, with seven states left blank, here in grey.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"As you can see up here in the electoral vote counter, former President Donald Trump holds an initial advantage with 235 electoral votes among the states that he is favoured to win, leading Vice President Harris with 213 electoral votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This trio has decided the last two presidential races and is likely to play kingmaker once again, as even if Trump does sweep the Sunbelt battlegrounds of Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, where he has generally polled better so far this cycle, if Kamala Harris can hold these three states in the Democratic column, she would hit exactly 270 electoral votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Nevertheless, she chose Waltz, and as per the latest polling average, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are exactly tied, based on 19 polls in Pennsylvania, 47.2% to 47.2%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Taking a look down here at the last three polls added to this average, the New York Times and Siena College had Harris up three points most recently, while the Trafalgar Group had Trump ahead by 2%, and then Fabrizio Lee showed them tied.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now here in 2024, the polls show Harris leading Trump by less than a full percentage point, 0.9%, based on 10 polls, with 47.9% to 47.0%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The New York Times, Siena, had Trump up three, insider advantage, has Harris up two, and then public opinion strategies has them tied.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's really just this outlier, Harris plus 11 poll from Emerson College, pushing Harris, head of Trump right now in the overall average.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The latest polling average via DDHQ has Harris up 1.8%, based on 13 polls, 49.2% to 47.4%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Keep in mind as well that Trump outperformed the polls by a greater margin here in Wisconsin than any other state in both of those elections.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"We've already seen Harris consolidate a lot of the minority support that Biden had lost in the polls, especially among voters who view both Trump and Biden unfavorably, which is key here in the rapidly diversifying and left-trending Sun Belt region.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But that said, she will probably struggle to match Biden's unusually strong backing from older, working-class white voters, which is key in the Rust Belt states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump even led Biden in several surveys here before he dropped out, but now with Harris in the race she does lead Trump by 2.6% on average based on 5 polls, 44.9% to 42.3%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now the hope is for Democrats that Harris can stop some of that bleeding, and thereby keep Georgia competitive.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
The latest two surveys showed Harris leading by a point in the two candidates tied here in Georgia.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump had previously led in the last 10 polls added to this average.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Again, Trump had been consistently polling ahead of Biden here in 2024, and that does continue against Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The latest average via DDHQ in the Hill has him up 2.4% based on 7 polls thus far.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump is averaging 47.2% across these 7 surveys, compared to Harris's 44.8%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In this video, Donald Trump is favored in the electoral college race, though neither candidate is currently projected to hit the necessary 270 electoral votes based on the latest polling averages in key battleground states.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"As you see here, Harris is the slight favorite to win the 2024 presidential race at minus 125, compared to Trump's plus 105.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Our new poll shows Harris has slipped a point, notably falling below 50% to 49% while Trump remains at 47.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And now turning to the campaign trail where Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are blitzing battleground states in hopes of eating out election wins as these polls remain incredibly tight.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump and his Madison Square Garden rally where the ugly comments are still reverberating.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris last night where she pledged to unify a divided country.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Donald Trump won all three in 2016 when he was elected president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I'm very, very optimistic, number one, Trump usually outperforms the polls by about four or five points.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He did that in Michigan, both in 16 and 20.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Any other just worried that under a Harris administration, it's going to continue.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So every I think I think Harris peaked last not this past weekend, but the weekend before I think she peaked eight or nine days ago.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And it's there's only one way for her to go.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And that's down, and I think Donald Trump is going to benefit from that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's got to pick up another state so it becomes complex you would like to get as Two states as possible that you have to win in order to get to that 270 for Harris It's again pretty simple.,Donald Trump,Michigan
That's how Trump did it in 2016.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Everybody raised their cell phones in the air and hit record at one of her stops this evening.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris stopped by cred cafe on the east side, which hosted a watch party for a radio town hall that aired from Detroit with harris and host charlotte main the god.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"After the show, harris met with voters like retired Detroit school teacher Justine Trevick.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris also made a stop at Norwest Art Gallery, a locally owned business on the northwest side.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump's campaign released a statement that said in part quote Kamala Harris is making a last minute attempt to win over black men after years of failure from day one.,Donald Trump,Michigan
President Trump has listened to black men and delivered real results.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, no, she she's by far who who my family would love to see in the White House.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Both Harris and Trump will be in metro Detroit on Friday.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I know that Vice President Harris is going to have a choice of a lot of qualified individuals.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There very well could be other names that are just not being talked about, but I know that Vice President Harris is going to have a choice of a lot of qualified individuals.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And when Kamala Harris was endorsed by the President and everybody across the party, all across the country, stepped up to say now let's come together and be unified with her, I think it bodes very well for the future.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I don't remember anything about Donald Trump prior to his political candidacy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I've seen his cameos and sex in the city and Home Alone 2, but I didn't really have that knowledge of him until long after he became president, just because all of that is kind of a little before my time.",Donald Trump,Michigan
My feelings were mostly anxiety about the potential of Donald Trump being elected.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It was a put a lot on Trump, but it wasn't even like his fault.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump started Project Warp Speed, but then once he left office and Biden was there and pushing out the vaccine, all of a sudden the vaccine was being railed against by people that were former Trump allies.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris is the best option we have right now.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's restored a bit of that faith that democracy will win.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I know Kamala is more like women's rights.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Former President Donald Trump was the headliner in Dallas last night at the Conservative Political Action Conference or CPAC, capping a four-day parade of speakers who claim to believe the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump despite mountains of evidence disproving it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
There has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our Republic than Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump won.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump allies also winning key U. S Senate primaries in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina and Arizona, if you had been in the U. S Senate, would you have objected to the 2020 certification: you know, I think what Holly and I believe what Cruz did was right.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Michigan Congressman Peter Meyer voted to impeach Trump after the capital attack this week.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Amisha, the latest Quinnipiac poll shows Trump with a seven point lead in Georgia.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Politico reports part of the reason could be gains Trump has made with black men.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It's not that black men are significantly shifting to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"NBC reports, Harris appears to be okay with the collective jitters, recognizing that if Democrats fear they might lose, they're more apt to show up at the polls and help her win.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Do you agree with that, i mean, 17 days out, how do you see Harris's chances as of today, right now: i mean, it's a complete coin flip at this point, but I do think that fear of losing is a very good motivator.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There was a period of time where it looked like Kamala Harris was on cruise control and that she had this in the bag, and apathy can be dangerous for a campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Look, I wouldn't want to be in the position that she has seen over the last few days, or last few weeks, where polling has shifted towards Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There's no question that the polling has been at least in the margins that matter these days, it's been moving towards Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She needs to find some way to recapture the momentum.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Maybe the way to do that is to make sure that people understand the stakes, that there's a very real chance that Donald Trump is president again very soon.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But why did she wait so long, is she being underutilized, or might she be the ultimate surrogate for Harris so they're saving her firepower for the home stretch: i think it's more of the latter than the former.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris has not been the Democratic nominee officially for a very long time.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So, she was being strategic with the calendar she was given.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Yeah, and Brandon Harris is also rallying with to Amisha's point, former President Obama next week.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And we saw his fiery remarks in Arizona yesterday.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
He's got another event tonight.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
How critical do you see both Obamas as being on the trail for Harris: because she's just trying to energize that coalition.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Look, Kamala Harris had to spend a lot of weeks presenting herself as a credible alternative to Donald Trump, introducing herself, making the case that she is not this out of touch progressive that a lot of people feared she might be.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I think she's done that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And of course, Barack Obama is pretty good at lobbying insults at Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This past week, Donald Trump gave a speech in Potterville, Michigan, and during the speech, he said that as he was driving up to this small venue in Potterville, there were thousands and thousands of people outside as far as the eye could see that were there as he was driving up.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It turns out, like everything he says, this is totally false.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And guess what: there were not thousands and thousands of people as far as the eye can see as he was driving up.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"There actually weren't that many people outside, let me show you the moment Donald Trump was driving up as captured by WLNS.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So surprise, surprise, he's lying.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, so what Donald Trump does at all of these, all of these events, he always lies about the crowd sizes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And one of the other things he does is he like waves to nobody while he's getting on his airplane or while he's showing up at events.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And there's quite literally nobody there, he'll leave one of the buildings that he has his name on and he'll wave.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, like he accuses vice president Kamala Harris of using AI crowds and things like that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Meanwhile, Donald Trump gives himself fake AI endorsements of Swifties and Taylor Swift.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, and look all Donald Trump does his lie and lie about crowd sizes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump is not losing sleep over that question.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Here's a 78 year old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he wrote down his golden escalator nine years ago.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It has been a constant stream of gripes and grievances that that's actually been getting worse now that he's afraid of losing the common.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Again, one of the things that Donald Trump said at the latest speech he gave, I think he gave one in Pennsylvania on Friday where he talked about, he goes, no one talks about how big my crowd sizes are.",Donald Trump,Michigan
This is what he said on Friday.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Play this clip, and they say he had a hundred thousand people.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And remember that speech he gave in New Jersey was actually in Wildwood, New Jersey.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So when Trump was proclaiming there was 107,000 people in Wildwood, New Jersey, it made no sense because the venue could only hold 20,000.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And then Donald Trump spoke in the Bronx.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He claimed there were 25,000 people.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And actually at that event, Donald Trump had a rapper named Sleepy Hollow talking.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump was bragging about the guy's grill.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And this is how Trump was showing that he was having black support.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Here's Donald Trump praising the grill of Sleepy Hollow.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But over and over again, this is what Trump does, you know, he'll go into a black church, fill it with white MAGA supporters and claim he's speaking at a black church.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, he's always just bragging about these crowd sizes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And ultimately, when he goes in front of a place that's like not friendly, he'll always get booed.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Remember when he spoke in front of the Libertarian Convention and they like booed him off the stage here.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And it's very important, remember when Donald Trump went to Philadelphia and tried to sell his gold sneakers and they booed him as well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that's what's really getting under Donald Trump's skin right now is that, you know, she's filling up stadiums that are bigger than his.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So he's going into these small venues and these really small kind of towns like Potterville.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And then he's saying, oh, you don't even see the people.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And then he, at the speeches themselves, you know, you want to see what it reminds you, just what he talked about in Potterville in front of the small crowd.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Here's what he talked about, billions of dollars, you know, somebody said, what do you think he lost: i said, probably two, three billion.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And, you know, if you want to see who these Trump supporters are, I mean, they're out there holding sperm cups of JD vans.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They're trying to say that JD vans, this is like the Trump and JD van supporters saying how fertile he is by holding family kit cups and as part of their opposition to IVF.",Donald Trump,Michigan
You've got these Trump supporters who are out there wearing diapers and saying diapers over Dems.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"They're wearing shirts that say, I'm with the convicted felon.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So is this the way it's going to go, is Trump driving up his numbers where he was getting votes in prior elections and not necessarily getting the votes in the states that he needs: maybe that's one look.",Donald Trump,Michigan
What would happen now on this number from 219 compared to her 225: that would take him to 229.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Maybe the Arab American vote maybe the union vote does have an effect on Trump's number in Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He won there in 2016 after all and maybe in Pennsylvania perhaps they could go for blue collar Scranton Joe but they can't go for Kamala from California.,Donald Trump,Michigan
That's as some Republicans pushed back on her visit.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And now he's admitting it flat out.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump was president, a Muslim, as bad as he is in many ways.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Why are you voting for Donald Trump: it really just boils down to policy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
That's something I need more of that's something I need to learn more about that independence Trump was the only one in 2016 that I could see who even had the freedom To do the right thing the rest of my own body donor classes.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He care about detroit care about blacks.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I know some feeling But kamala harris, she like locked like he said locked up a lot of people from them and uh california that was black Damn, I thought she was black, but she not she like indian or something like that and it's like That was kind of that was kind of shocking and then I heard that she was using fake accents or something like that I knew it was like you see me but donald trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
He got his ways.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Like I said, but he's a good person at my eyes at least We drove around detroit for two days just kind of crisscross through Kind of poor beat up and middle class neighborhoods Trying to get a bunch of different people to talk to us And the people that said they were voting for kamala.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She she Depending on the what day you're asking she might say if you if it's a monday She might say i'm a black if it's a tuesday.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She might say i'm an indian american tomorrow and she might say i'm a jew So I don't think people believe in her.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
What did she do: nothing and she wants to start helping the day one.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
You know what her day one was three and a half years ago Not now it just went on and on and on so it's actually disgusting to see People calling him racist or homophobic.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That was a bad move She thinks they think she gonna help but honestly she not gonna help what it is Bring it like a memories.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
It's the Harris administration So at least I'm not saying that Trump is gonna I'm gonna be honest with people I'm not saying Trump is gonna change that but at least we have a shot.,Donald Trump,Michigan
This is the reason why I support and I endorse President Trump because we're going to stop the wars.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So for those that are uncommitted, or for those that decide not to vote, or for those that are deciding to vote for Jill Stein, not voting or voting for a third-party candidate is a vote for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump created an environment that was not good for us.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I'm committed for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"When I talk to people in private settings, I get the sense that Kamala Harris will win.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The majority of this community, over Donald Trump, somebody say hello and give a good one.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So one of the most democratic pollsters you can get is showing a Trump plus four in the state of Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So if all of that is real, which I don't think any of it's really realistic, but if the races are that close that means more of a Trump lead than anything because Trump is always under polled.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So if Trump is that close in any of those states that really helps him out a bunch.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And to show you right here, so Trump leads point five in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He leads point two.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But he does lead barely, but Trump does lead in Pennsylvania as well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He has Michigan if you see Michigan and then you look at Wisconsin here.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Remember Trump is severely always under polled in Wisconsin.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So if he's almost winning Wisconsin he's going to really do well in the state of Wisconsin.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Then there's North Carolina a Trump a decent Trump lead.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he got Georgia there a decent Trump lead as well.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So overall Trump is winning the electoral college in this scenario.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump wins North Carolina.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He wins Arizona.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Now he needs one of these states.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He wins the election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Let's say he wins Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He doesn't win the election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
If Trump was one of these states and also Arizona Georgia and North Carolina he wins the election no matter what.,Donald Trump,Michigan
If he just wins one of these three states and if he's leading in two of those states which remember Michigan is the more left leaning state out of them.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So if he's leading in a state like Michigan over Wisconsin then Trump's just going to sweep every single one of these states and have a 3 0 6 2 3 3 which technically this is my prediction from my prediction video.,Donald Trump,Michigan
You can see him maybe make gains in Virginia Minnesota New York California.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"You never know, trump could have a landslide victory if everything gets put into place.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is what's showing right now, so it'd be to 96 to 242, trump overwhelmingly wins the election in this scenario.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I believe he also gets close to winning the popular vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I'm not sure if he'd won the popular vote but it's possible.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I know if he swept all of the rust belt and then won these states I could see him winning the popular vote in that scenario.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So but then based on like margins of like error and like Trump underperforming I mean overperforming polls you have kind of like this scenario.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And then when I show you Hillary Clinton when he faced Hillary Clinton Trump was in the lead in Nevada and Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly won Nevada.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Like he's expecting to like win Pennsylvania Michigan Wisconsin in this scenario like based on all the errors and also the the under polling by him.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And let's just say he won Nevada like 312 to 226.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And him him picking up several states as well as like sneaking in Nevada.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I mean Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump is just pushing ahead and closing the gap in so many states.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Look at this, harris led almost since she almost since Biden withdrew and Trump finally has lead in the state of Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
He it's almost the election time and he already almost has he already has a lead.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
He has a lead in the state of Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
He's going to close the gap sooner or later in Wisconsin.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
But he's really been closing the gap since Harris withdrew.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So it's just it just shows that Trump is making gains.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And Nevada is the only odd one out here, i don't really see him making gains yet.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And he is up in the actual average in a state like Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I would have never thought by Election Day that Trump would have been leading in the average in Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But I bet it is still crazy to think that Trump is in the lead in a state like Michigan Michigan a state that just votes almost straight liberal.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But just to tell you guys I just want to show you like the gains Trump's been making Michigan actually leading for Trump in the actual average.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's just crazy to see, but I just wanted to show you everything guys just to show you how much Trump's really been making gains in all of these states.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump can really make this map happen or even this map or even this map.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump has a rally in Detroit just about a block away from here.,Donald Trump,Michigan
What's at the top of his list of what he has to do in this race: i think that this race has turned in the last couple of days from a persuasion operation to a mobilization operation.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I imagine Vice President Harris gets a little bit of glee about poking Trump on his age, his stamina.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know you talked about mobilization just a moment ago, but in terms of like politics of issues, is there anything, and let's talk about both candidates starting with Trump, that they have to really nail in terms of the Michigan voters: this has been an absolute consistency in this campaign.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris on the other hand is focusing on abortion.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That's why Harris is focusing on it and Trump doesn't want to talk about it.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And of course, Trump comes here and it crumbles across the Midwest, actually.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And what about Kamala Harris, what's the key thing she needs to convince Michiganders to do: to turn out and vote.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But I won't, so it's really a strategy for Trump to try to lock in those votes that he was so successful with eight years ago.",Donald Trump,Michigan
This is the place to be you know the Trump Vance ticket has to explain why are they taking five why would they take 500 million dollars away from American workers and yet you've got Vice President Harris who is talking about supporting American workers and supporting our manufacturing industry and being a president for everyone.,Donald Trump,Michigan
showing VP Harris has a one percent lead in Georgia and President Trump also has a one percent lead in North Carolina and Wisconsin.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
But in Arizona he has a three percent lead.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he shepherded that economy right into a crisis.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And you've got to remember Kamala Harris has been a candidate for president of the United States for about 92 days.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I'm certain that they are out there, but the conversations we are having is that if you want Alyssa Slocan to be the kind of senator who brings home the work for Michigan, we've got to have a White House as well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Take that bill to fix the border problem that could have happened had Donald Trump not called his cronies in Congress and said, don't pass that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
A large portion of the state's Arab American population isn't happy with Harris over the administration's continued support for Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You're not looking at the polls, but is there anything that you would want the Harris campaign to really hammer home in the final stretch here: i think that you asked the question about the economy.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think the conversations need to continue about how a Harris administration would handle the economy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think that folks still need to get to know who Kamala Harris is in some instances and what she will do.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I think the work she's done to do the television interviews, the town hall that she just had, tremendously helpful in telling that story of who she is and what she will do.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's really interesting that you're saying, you have to remind people of who Kamala Harris is.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump holds 48 percent while Harris has 46 percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Poll 2, Redfield & Wilton Strategies From October 20 to 22, Redfield & Wilton Strategies recorded Trump with a one-point lead over Harris, with Trump at 48 percent and Harris at 47 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Although close, Trump's lead in this poll suggests Harris is still competitive and within striking distance.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Poll 4, Marist College Another Marist College poll from the same period, October 17 to 22, slightly favors Harris by one point, with her at 49 percent and Trump at 48 percent, this slight lead for Harris underscores how close Georgia's voter sentiment is, with both candidates holding narrow leads in different samples.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Poll 5, Morning Consult Conducted between October 16 and 20, Morning Consult shows Trump with a two-point lead, where he has 50 percent to Harris's 48 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"With this poll, we see Trump gaining ground, showing Georgia's dynamic support shifts between both candidates.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Poll 6, Morning Consult Also from October 16 to 20, Morning Consult shows Trump at 49 percent and Harris at 48 percent, giving Trump a one-point lead.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris's narrow lead here is a reminder of the unpredictable nature of this race in Georgia.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Poll 1, Insider Advantage This poll, conducted on October 26 and 27, has Trump ahead by one point at 49 percent, while Harris holds 48 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump's slim lead indicates Michigan is just as tightly contested as Georgia, with both candidates fiercely competing for voter support.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Poll 2, Patriot Polling Between October 24 and 26, Patriot Polling shows Trump leading by one point again, with him at 50 percent and Harris at 49 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump's steady edge in Michigan reflects a competitive environment, as Harris maintains close numbers.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Poll 3, Glend-Eraff Group Conducted between October 22 and 24, Glend-Eraff Group shows Harris with a three-point lead, sitting at 47 percent while Trump is at 44 percent.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"This poll reveals a shift, as Harris gains a slight advantage, showing how fluid Michigan's voter base can be.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Poll 5, Quinnipiac University Conducted from October 17 to 21, this Quinnipiac University poll shows Harris ahead by four points, with 50 percent to Trump's 46 percent.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris's lead here demonstrates her capacity to draw support, despite Trump's consistent presence.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Poll 6, Quinnipiac University Another Quinnipiac University poll from October 17 to 21 shows Harris leading by three points, at 49 percent to Trump's 46 percent.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And obviously, I really don't think that Trump is going to protect people who are part of the LGBT community, especially those who are trans.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Did he actually say that: i don't know.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He didn't exactly say that, corporations have been gouging.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Do you think Trump doesn't want women to vote: i'm not saying Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's the leader who's getting them in.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he's only had a few months in as a senator.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So what does he know, are you two: yeah.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, there's some things that need to be changed, but Kamala's going to do that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's going to make the changes.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And anybody but a felon, anybody what: but a felon, but a felon: okay, anybody but Trump, what do you hate about Trump the most: his rhetoric.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's nasty, he's, he's degrading.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's a very hateful man.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he's going to ruin our country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He already has divided our country with his first term.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And I'm also really excited to be out here supporting Kamala Harris for president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I think that Kamala is definitely going to be a lot better for America than Trump will.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So that's really important to me, and obviously I really don't think that Trump is going to protect people who are part of the LGBT community, especially those who are trans.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He didn't exactly say that, he has supported legislation for, for example, in Florida when they, with the Don't Say Gay Bill, as well as being against drag queens and perpetuating the lie that drag queens are pedophiles.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"What do you think Kamala Harris should do first if she gets elected, what do you think she'll do first: i think that the first thing she should do is get a ceasefire done in Israel and Gaza.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think that's definitely one of the top things that she should do when she gets elected.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So you clearly don't like Donald Trump, what do you not like about him the most: i worry about the future of unions and the future of the American people and the fact that he's a charlatan and a liar, and it surprises me that it's this close.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"What did he lie about, what has he lied about: it's the simpler question to answer, and that's maybe his name and his age, and that's about it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
What do you think Kamala should do first if she gets elected: she'll know what to do.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She didn't even really have a good answer.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"All right, trying to find some Trump people out here protesting, but I don't think that's going to happen.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala is going to save us.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Okay, you go Kamala and Waltz.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Yeah, well, why are you, why are you so fired up about Kamala Harris and the Democrats this year: well, I've been a fairly long-term Democrat and this year in particular, I'd say this is probably again, one of the most important elections of our lifetime.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I agree, and she's got to win.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's got to win for our country.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I'm worried about it even when she wins.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He ran on a lot of resentment, like you said, false information.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I just feel Kamala just has that spark that we need as a country to bring everybody together.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So it's more she's good, not as much.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He's bad because a lot of people, right: a lot of people are like, I just don't like him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But the reason why they don't like him is because of the premise that he comes.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He ran up under resentment, no offense, but he really did.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, a lot of whites, he felt like he appealed to the ones who felt like, oh, man, you know, we haven't had our day.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So he got with them.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I just think with him, you think she's got it all all together.",Donald Trump,Michigan
What is it about Trump that you do not like: he's unhinged.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he doesn't care about people at all.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Nothing at all: no, so you think he did a terrible job as president: oh, absolutely.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"What was wrong with what he did, how did the country... What was wrong in 2016 to 2020: well, I mean, let's just talk about COVID, for instance.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He turned that into more of a disaster than it would have been under better leadership.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"OK, he... One thing that sticks out in my mind is I was recently in Puerto Rico.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that is something that probably does need to be to change, and I think a lot of that, especially when it comes to, you know, the Harris administration, they look, they're going to look for ways to make things easier to access for everyday people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I... Trump is not going to do that.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So that lady basically said, what did Trump do wrong: and she said, well, Covid, you messed up Covid.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So that opinion is new, all he knows is Project 2025.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I'm not saying he's not smart.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's smart, but he also doesn't think women should have the rights.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that goes along with, you know, the... the two billionaires that are supporting him, the fool who sent him... Peter... Peter Tule.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Peter Tule, who actually... Yeah, the tool, he actually paid for J.D. Vance to go to college.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, this guy is really dangerous because he said women should not be voting.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But people who don't have kids wouldn't have votes because he said they don't have an interest in what's going on in the country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And Kamala has a plan for getting... getting that backed up so that they can't gouge you in times of trouble.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I'm going to go back to the neighborhoods and find some Trump people.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris is getting about 7% of Republicans.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I know she's making a big play for some of those Trump-resistant Republicans of late we've seen.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So there's no real clear leader with independents, but numerically, Harris has this slight higher number there.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But among likely voters, Harris is plus six, 50% to 44% with women.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And Donald Trump is plus six, equally 51% to 45% with men.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So what does that mean, then, why isn't Donald Trump running away with it if that's the environment: well, here's one issue.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Look at Kamala Harris's domination, issue of abortion and reproductive rights, she is running a 21-point margin ahead of Trump on trust to handle that issue.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump's still doing his best on immigration.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's got a 16-point lead over Harris on the economy, a 13-point lead, and on foreign policy, a 10-point lead.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But that abortion and reproductive rights number, that's one of the reasons Donald Trump is not yet running away with this race.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I think this explains a lot about why Democrats are so nervous, right: like, Harris was supposed to rebuild this coalition from Obama to, you know, kind of wash away the fears about Joe Biden.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And, you know, she's not really sort of running away with it in a way that, you know, there's concerns about black men voting, there's concerns about Arab Americans in Michigan, and it just means that, at the very end, you're gonna have Democrats, and Republicans, but Democrats do, very nervous at the end.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris is gonna be talking about abortion.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
He's talking about democracy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump is talking about immigration.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He talks a lot about the economy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The Trump curious, the Trump leaning voters, those are the things they talk about the most.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, let's sort of staying on Harris and how she is trying to focus on some of the issues that pop in this poll, and clearly in the data that they have inside the campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And I have been talking to Harris advisors about this, trying to press them if they think the abortion issue is as salient as it proved to be in the 2022 midterms, right on the heels of Roe versus Wade being overturned with the Dobbs decision.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And the Harris campaign believes that is part of what is keeping the issue so salient.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Okay, so that's abortion, and it's just sticking on the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The question Trump's pledge to go after enemies if elected, reason to vote against him, 50%, doesn't make a difference, 26, reason to vote for him, 24.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"These are negatives on Trump and it answers the question, well, you know, why isn't given everything we just said about the environment that Harris is running in, why isn't Trump running away with it: abortion's one answer.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But Donald Trump's behavior is clearly another part of this equation, as are his criminal convictions.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But the total, and he's more popular than ever, all those things are true, but they are still weights around him because I think without them, Donald Trump may be running away with it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So Saturday, Kamala Harris is going to be campaigning in a rally in Kalamazoo, trying to utilize a college town, Western Michigan University, with some special help from former First Lady Michelle Obama.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Donald Trump is holding a rally Friday night in Traverse City.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And rural areas is a big part of his strategy to counter Kamala Harris in the suburbs of Detroit and Grand Rapids.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And then on Saturday, Trump is going to one of the suburbs of Detroit and Novi for a rally up in Oakland County where Harris, her chances of winning this really hinge on really turning out a lot of voters are going to be running up the score in Oakland County and Kent County around Grand Rapids.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Lauren, who are those key voters then that Kamala Harris needs to win, and conversely for Donald Trump, is it mostly blue collar white men or which groups are you seeing these candidates really try to appeal to in terms of that turnout game: yeah, especially when it comes to areas like Oakland and Kent County, you're looking at suburban voters in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And so Harris is really trying to appeal to those voters, you know, certainly now in West Michigan, but she's spent a lot of time here in metro Detroit.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, that was kind of his marquee voter back in the 2016 cycle and Michigan after after losing it in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's certainly really trying to get that back.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So so that would be an area and also very interesting, and a lot of recent polling, we've seen a pretty significant gender gap with with women largely breaking for Harris and men largely breaking for Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And I think both candidates have a lot of work to do to convince, well, one, Trump with women and Harris with men to try and even the score a little bit and among gender gaps as well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, most of our recent polling, Harris is running 15 and 20 points above Trump overall and women.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And in many cases, in many places of the state, Trump, Trump wins that that that segment of female voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
There are a couple of state house races that are really hinging on on how how well Trump does at least hinging for Republicans.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And Lauren in terms of black men you mentioned there was some concern in the Harris campaign that they might not turn out and vote.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris has gone on several radio shows that are pretty popular in metro Detroit like the Breakfast Club.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's she's been making a pretty direct appeals to that subset of voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And the other thing that Trump is trying to do is he's trying to, he's trying to take advantage of the downright crisis the democrats have with their Arab American constituency.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They're not a family in Palestine, or, or Lebanon, and they live in, you know, mostly clustered in Dearborn Hamtramck Dearborn Heights but some other they're they're spread everywhere around the metro Detroit region and this is a real big looming fear, particularly as Trump just got the endorsements of the Hamtramck and Dearborn here, Heights Mary went to Hamtramck last week.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
They set up a sprung up a campaign office for him just to have this event it seems and so they are trying to see if they can at least play some little bit of offense here.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And nothing that Harris has said has gotten this uncommitted movement to move off of their, their opposition to to her, at the same time they're not endorsing Trump, or they say they're going to go out and try to work against Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If you look at 2016 Donald Trump won the state by 10,704 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And there was a nexus of of 220 230,000 people who who didn't vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And this is what Trump is kind of trying to play on a little bit to speaking to these black men saying, you know, this comeback that's that that's you know is seen in this was known as the 7.2, which is essentially greater downtown 7.2 square miles out of 137 square miles of a city that these that be there, some some Detroiters feel fully left behind by the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of sort of the sort of Republicans who were longtime Trump critics, so I'm not necessarily surprised by a lot of the names that have come out there.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I mean this is Trump messaging up and down the I-75 corridor between Detroit and Oakland County and Macomb County and then you go up into Flint and Saginaw Bay City that in our county is like one to watch on election night it has been a bellwether in Michigan presidential elections in the last in this century essentially and if Trump wins it like he did in 2016 seems like he might have a chance of going out of victory.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And that's why you have the Harris campaign putting multiple states into play and spending across multiple battlegrounds in case one state does fall.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Look, if you look at, look, too much of this conversation, by the way, is asymmetrical, right: it's all about Harris and what she's got to do.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But quite frankly, I'm more if I'm on the other side and I'm calling this, look, it's just as much about what Donald Trump's got to do.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But I would argue that he's got to break above 47, 48% in Michigan and Wisconsin in order to win those states without a lot of third party voting.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And not from polling, but in the polling also shows he's always at ceiling of 47, 48%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I would argue that from a strategic standpoint, I think the challenge really is for how does Donald Trump raise his ceiling in those states when we've had back to back elections where we know where voters have ended up and it's 47, 48% for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so if Trump picks off any one of these states, particularly Pennsylvania, then that's the ball game here, folks.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And we actually heard Donald Trump criticizing Harris today for not holding any rallies.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Here's what he said just a short time ago.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Fit them in where you can, so what do you think about that, Cornell, and what do you think about the decisions that have to be made, how hard are they sometimes: i tell this story to my team all the time.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And he also said that he can't respond to her.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now on X, of course, formerly Twitter, which he owns, Musk frequently shares misleading and false claims about the election going as far as picking fights with Michigan's top election official Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That was a key emphasis that he had the last time he was here in Detroit, which was just a matter of days ago, in which he told Michiganders that there are better days on the horizon, is what he had to say.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And as much better than it was in 2020 when Trump is the incumbent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump was the incumbent in 2016.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He only had 640,000 voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump only got 640, biden got 623.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Right, so you can say, well, look, Trump's numbers in 2020 were low.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Right here, so here's Trump, you only got 64.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump only had 640, that's significant, now you can make an argument and I don't think it's valid that in 2024 Biden got 623,000.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But it's because he's the incumbent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's the incumbent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I just think the incumbent because remember, Trump got in 2016, there's almost a million primary voters in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So pretty significant drop off and Trump got shellacked.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But even when Trump won in 2016, he won by like 10,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So it's extremely close, perhaps Kamala Harris is just a step behind.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She is going to be in Detroit today.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I'll be joining her at the rally in southwest Detroit.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump was the one who brought the Muslim ban.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump is no friend of the Arab-American community.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Recently, Trump expressed his dislike of Detroit, saying if Harris wins, quote, the whole country will end up being like Detroit, also calling that city horrible.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And for him to come and insult our great city, for Trump to come and insult the great people of Detroit is not acceptable.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump only talked about an infrastructure week, but Biden and Harris made it happen.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, I know you have a busy day ahead of you as you go to that rally with Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
The number of folks who've been active and will continue to be active in our campaign is one of the largest I've seen since I've been at the party.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris has been to the state four times since she became Democratic nominee in July.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump has been to the state nine times this election cycle, including five times in the last month alone.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In a town hall in Flint last week, he focused on cheap electric vehicle imports from China, a concern to many Michigan auto workers.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The United Automobile Workers Labor Union is a key political force in the state and has endorsed Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
But she faces headwinds from Arab Americans angry over the war in Gaza.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"In Detroit last week, Harris did not address Gaza.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She highlighted Republican efforts to restrict abortion, which has been a winning issue for Democrats.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"All right, trump and Vice President Harris are locked in a dead heat with just two weeks before election day.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
We're going to be talking about the 2020 U.S. today Suffolk University polling that Harris is up 45% to 44%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But Fox News polling shows Trump has regained the lead with 50% to 48%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's also gained ground in the swing state.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So much so that pollster Nate Silver now rates the chances of a Trump win as slightly more likely than a Harris win, 52% to 47%, but clearly this is anyone's game.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The trends are going Trump's way, as I mentioned, Nate Silver now has him up just very slightly.",Donald Trump,Michigan
There were also some reports coming out of people who were getting text messages from phone bankers for Kamala Harris who expressed that they weren't going to support her or volunteer for her because of her position on the Israel-Gaza conflict.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
It's telling me about Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I just wanna make sure he knows what a real poll says.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So potato, potato, it didn't help him in any event.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But what do you make overall of the change in the national and swing state picture: i wrote on Twitter and I said right here on the show, that's it, Kamala Harris is the favorite.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala had about a one and a half point lead going into debate.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And she crushed in the debate.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But not only did she crush, Trump said so many things that were bound to go viral.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And once a huge number of Americans have heard him saying crazy things.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"right: of course, that's he's gonna take a beating in the polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Which is lower than the percentage who said he won the debate overall.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Even some of the hardcore MAGA people who lied to themselves and said that he won, don't think he looked like the sort of person that would listen to them or understand what they're going through.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Of course not, he shouldn't listen to a person like me.",Donald Trump,Michigan
You've got Donald Trump who instituted a ban on people from predominantly Muslim countries or what came to be known as the Muslim ban.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"As of right now, we know Trump is leading in the polls and he is beating all the other GOP candidates by a lot.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So it's possible that over time, once the reality sets in that it could be Biden versus Trump again, maybe that 2020 attitude could come back in and people could start to think, well, I'd rather have a Democrat versus a Republican in office.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We always hear about Harris having to defend her blue wall and of course Michigan is a major part of that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That's Grand Rapids where the VP is going to be starting her day and that is a county that former President Trump won in 2016 and then President Biden won in 2020.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Counties that Donald Trump does not have a chance to win in but that are the most populated counties in the state.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He lost that state by over 35 points in 2020 but just getting about 30% of the vote that is still 250,000 votes which can make a big impact in that state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So the strategy we're seeing from former President Trump today has to do with getting more Republicans out in those districts that are going to be blue districts while VP Harris is actually branching out and fighting for more of a battleground county today.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
We saw in there that about only 46% say that Harris would put immigrants above citizens actually.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I shouldn't say only, 46% of Arizonans say she would put immigrants before citizens.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
These are people who are coming here illegally she's talking about whereas for former President Trump it is 67% who say he would put those citizens first.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
With Carrie Lake you have someone who has sort of framed her political persona around former President Trump's persona.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
We've heard people on the ground there say that she's kind of like Donald Trump with all the bad but none of the good.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She doesn't have the record to run on.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She doesn't have examples of things she's accomplished but she's sort of viewed as we saw in some of those numbers as more of an extremist.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So I think while she may have policies that are the same as or analogous to former President Trump and he's doing well voters have President Trump's administration look back on in his accomplishments from that they don't really have that for Carrie Lake.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think that's been hurting her.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Vice President Kamala Harris kicks off her presidential campaign today while praising President Joe Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I am supporting and endorsing her because President Biden supported her yesterday and he quite frankly was the person that got 14 million votes in a Democratic nominating election throughout the 50 states.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And she was part of that ticket.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Some Republicans already honing in on Harris as a likely choice, though the state party's chair believes their message won't change.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If anything, and some of the issues, especially regarding the automobile industry, she's further left than where Joe Biden was.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think she will be a strong candidate.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think she'll be a great president of the United States.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's got to go out and work.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And she has to go campaign to the delegates to win the nomination.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But as support within the party continues to grow, many are looking to whom Harris will choose to be her potential running mate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I'm not going anywhere, so what should Harris be looking forward to win Michigan: quite frankly, I want to see someone who cares about the Heartland, who understands the battleground state, who's going to work hard to bring people together, who's going to care about our economy fighting for working men and women.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So I think there are probably a number of candidates that she is going to be looking for.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But after the last 24 hours, the list of those who could have the clout to challenge Vice President Harris has gotten very narrow.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If we step back from national polling, which has bounced between Kamala Harris plus one and Kamala Harris plus two with some anecdotal outlier polls of Kamala Harris plus four, which we will see if those become the norm over the next seven or 10 days.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Donald Trump is winning in an average of recent polls right now.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's a reversal from 2020, in 2020, Trump lost Arizona in current polling.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump is winning, now, admittedly, only one of these polls is from after the debate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Maybe this isn't all roses and ginger snaps for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And in fact, of the two post-debate polls, one is tied and one has Trump winning.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So Trump is actually gaining ground in the state of Wisconsin.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"North Carolina, trump is winning right now, although it is tighter than we would expect.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, we have two post-debate polls from Pennsylvania, Harris leading one, Trump leading one.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So lest anyone take comfort, in the numbers that we are seeing from the optimistic for Harris scenario, I've just outlined to you the way the Electoral College is looking as though it would fall if the election were held today, understanding that when Trump's winning by point two and the polling on average has a margin of error of three, we all understand that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So now having outlined the rosy scenario for Kamala Harris and having outlined the rosy scenario for Donald Trump, I want to focus in on North Carolina.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Well, the Harris campaign quickly turning the former president's remarks into campaign ads.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Everyone is well aware of the former president's comments and the response is coming from the Harris campaign.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I am endorsing him and telling my community to vote for him as well.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So why on earth vote for Donald Trump and encourage others to do it: because I believe there has to be accountability.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris is going to continue the same exact policies under Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So it's not me saying she's 100% guaranteed to do the same.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She is saying that her campaign advisers have come out and said it.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I will vote Harris, but I will not have the energy or the audacity knocking doors on my Muslim community and tell them to vote for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
They all want the Biden-Harris administration to get much tougher with Israel and try harder to stop the civilian deaths.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
He puts me in a very awkward position.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Online ads try to emphasize Kamala Harris' understanding of the civilian cost of this conflict.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
This key battleground state is seeing a close race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"This poll shows both Harris and Trump tied at 46%, making Michigan one of the most competitive states in this election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Poll three, also by the New York Times Sienna College, has Harris leading Trump by one point with 48% for Harris and 47% for Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris's slight edge here points to her strength in suburban areas.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Poll two from the New York Times Sienna College shows Trump ahead by three points, with 46% to Harris's 43%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump's support in Michigan's rural areas plays a major role in this result.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris is holding strong in urban and suburban areas, while Trump's base remains solid in rural parts of the state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You launched in 2015, and you have grown your business to what it is today under the Trump administration and also the Biden administration, and oh, let's throw a pandemic in that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Under the Trump administration, we were going through COVID, and it was a really tough time for us, so we pivoted into construction, and we've been doing great since then.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Which gives you the most optimism for the next four years for your business: i really support Kamala Harris and the $50,000 that she's proposing to give to startups.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Both Trump and Harris are neck and neck in these critical states.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Kamala Harris is at 46%, while Donald Trump is at 47%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump leads by just 1%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Here Harris takes the lead with 49% compared to Trump's 45%.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris leads by 4 points.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"While Trump has a slim lead in one poll, Harris is ahead in another, and we even see ties in two separate polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This poll shows Trump with a slight edge at 50%, while Harris is at 47%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump leads by 3 points.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Poll 3, another Atlacentele poll from October 12 to October 17, once again, Trump is at 50%, and Harris at 47%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In this poll, Harris leads with 51%, while Trump is at 43%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris has an 8-point advantage here.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Poll 5, another Bulfine's Group poll from the same period, october 11 to October 17, Harris extends her lead to 53%, while Trump is at 45%, giving her another 8-point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now the Washington Post numbers come as a bit of good news for the Kamala Harris campaign as they saw today this morning, the 538 forecasts switch in favor of former President Trump at 53 to 47.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But the new set of high quality polls for the Washington Post show Kamala Harris in a pretty competitive position in some of these battleground states despite a lot of the mainstream media narrative that this race is moving away from the Vice President, these numbers would actually suggest otherwise.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And the margin of error here is close enough that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris could reasonably be winning some of these states where Donald Trump has the upper hand, Kamala Harris has the upper hand.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But like I said, top line numbers here while it may be competitive, Kamala Harris does in fact come ahead.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Amongst registered voters, the numbers are a bit less beneficial for Kamala Harris, but amongst likely voters, her lead expands.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And a big reason that she holds a lead in some of these battleground states comes down to her support amongst young women in particular, shifting further and further away.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And that matters, right: it's coming to a point where Donald Trump is winning a significant chunk of young men, according to the Washington Post, a significant number of young women, according to the Washington Post.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And yet, one is being, seemingly, one is being more heavy than the other because Kamala Harris holds a larger advantage amongst young women than Trump does amongst young men.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And so at large here Kamala Harris holds roughly a one point advantage amongst key state likely voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Donald Trump holds roughly a three point advantage over Kamala Harris, 49 to 46.",Donald Trump,Michigan
That's pretty substantial for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, I don't believe that she's winning the state by four points, but I do think there's a reason to believe that maybe she could be winning in the state of Georgia.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Right now I have Donald Trump winning it in my own forecast, but it's not out of the reality that Kamala Harris could win the state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's only a lean state in my forecast at most for Donald Trump, and that's well within a reasonable margin of error.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The next state is Pennsylvania, Kamala Harris holds a two-point lead in that state that puts her over the 270 needed to win the election, and in Wisconsin, Kamala Harris holds a three-point lead, according to the Washington Post.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"As of right now, Kamala Harris holds a narrow advantage, but ultimately still a close race.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That matters for Kamala Harris' campaign, and maybe that could be boosting the state and driving it to the left.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's going to be a close race and I still have Donald Trump having the upper hand in, but still the Washington Post.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The only state you can't take away from the state she currently has is Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And that puts Donald Trump in a position where actually he doesn't actually win the election with Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It puts him at 265.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He'd need the state of Nevada at that point, but it makes it a lot better.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's numbers that are quite promising for Vice President Harris really come at a time where the campaign is looking for some good news when it comes down to polling data, looking for some good news when it comes down to data analysis and understanding our efforts working in the Rust Belt, our efforts working in North Carolina and Arizona and Georgia.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But it's definitely pleasant news for the Kamala Harris campaign where they previously were thinking, no data points between now and the election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's good for Kamala Harris, but it's still very much competitive because she's losing North Carolina.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's losing Arizona, both of these states by three points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's tied in Nevada state that even Hillary Clinton won in 2016 by 2.4%.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
New approval polling in critical swing states has Kamala Harris with higher favorability than Donald Trump.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"By definition, if that is what we look at to say, hey, who can win these states: kamala Harris now leading those favorability polls has to be a bad sign for Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So let's discuss what is going on, alternate Internet erupts after Fox News poll shows Harris beating Trump's approval in swing states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Kamala Harris now leads Trump 49, 47 in the critical state of Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris leads 49, 46 in the not normally critical state of Minnesota.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"In so far as it's not usually close, harris leads by 851 to 43 and critically in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Spending the entire RNC did Trump and his fellow Republicans attacking Joe Biden, making the case as to why Joe Biden shouldn't can't must not be president.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris is approval rating surges as Trump's falls.,Donald Trump,Michigan
There's also an ABC News Ipsos poll showing Harris's favorability overall at 43.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That's up eight up eight and Trump's favorability down to 36.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is not at an individual state level, but on average, Harris leading Trump in favorability, 43 to 36.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
These are really bad numbers for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It is effectively tied Trump leading by an average of zero point seven, zero point seven.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The problem with that is in that average, you have a Trump seven point lead and six point lead that are before Biden dropped out.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And one of the really important aspects to this, not only the polling, not only the money that's coming in behind Kamala Harris, but it is what appears to be a growingly difficult situation for J.D. Vance, where rumors are now flying.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
This has been consistent where Vice President Harris has had a lead on values and that's starting to expand a little bit.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
When asked who would do a better job handling the nation's economy 51 percent of the voters said former President Trump while 44 percent chose Vice President Harris and 48 percent said they believe Mr. Trump would do a better job handling foreign affairs compared to 46 percent choosing the Vice President on that issue.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
When asked which candidate represents change 46 percent said Vice President Harris while 44 percent identified former President Trump.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Donald Trump, over 270 electoral votes, he would clinch the presidency for a second time, but no map is a foregone conclusion.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Here's a scenario that's probably her likeliest path to victory.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She picks up one electoral vote in Nebraska, and then Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, the Rust Belt, the blue wall holds right there.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But of course the polls could be off in the other direction, or Trump is able to hold, this is Trump's likeliest path to victory.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If he holds the two battlegrounds out West, in Nevada and Arizona, and the two Southern battlegrounds, Georgia and North Carolina, he is then just one state away from clinching the presidency.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They're looking at the gender gap.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What do the numbers actually say: well, I mean, during the Trump administration, there was, you know, from the beginning of Trump's first, you know, when he was inaugurated in 2017 to his the peak of his employment in Michigan, we're not my Michigan alone.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But a lot of those gains were also seen during the Trump administration.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And you can see both sides trying to say the same thing, blaming COVID for Joe Biden's losses or Trump's losses and the gains both ways.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And Donald Trump often talks about crime on the campaign trail as well.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"One, Trump is saying that crime is up 43 percent in the United States.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So in Trump's case, he's using something called a survey that is done by the Department of Justice.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But I want to remind people, people know who Donald Trump is.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He was the Donald Trump we all know.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I think Kamala Harris wins.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You took Beaver County, which is Trump country.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It is definitely Trump country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he didn't make the situation in Beaver County better.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"In fact, he brought more chaos.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And some of the averages they see Trump actually making a gate.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"When you think about Donald Trump and his appeal to all of your voters in your states, to half of the voters in states, what do you think the appeal of Donald Trump to be, what do you think they'd like to do: i think there's a lot of folks who are frustrated that they don't see government solving problems in their communities.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump talks a good game about that.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, he has a history of failing to deliver over and over and over again.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But to that point, again, back to those polls, the economy, immigration, by far those people who are polled trust Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So what you're saying about, look, he didn't do the job back then, they don't think that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Again, people are still supporting Donald Trump despite what you're saying.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And it had nothing to do with Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So Donald Trump's message is getting through.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Kamala Harris's message, since she is tied in with the Biden administration, even if things are improving, they're still blaming her for that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
The very kinds of policies that Kamala Harris is running on.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
There are a lot of people in the community that are supporting Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But at the end of the day, do you want a leader who's going to throw gas on the fire to keep you angry so that you tune out, or do you want one who's going to try to get in there and solve problems, who cares about you and your family, who wants to bring peace to the region and get the hostages returned and rebuild the area and support families here in the United States: that's what Kamala Harris offers.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Governor, you've already heard what Donald Trump said this week.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Kamala Harris wins, what's your big worry: he's already laying the groundwork to undermine the outcome of this election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
His running mate has said he believes Donald Trump won the last election.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I do not have confidence that Donald Trump won't whine about it, won't put out dangerous rhetoric and mis- and disinformation.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Kamala, she doesn't do anything.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I feel like definitely there's more of, like, young men who are supporting Trump than young women who are supporting Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump has been reaching out to young male voters, shirking traditional media interviews for conversations with podcasters, influencers and gamers, all popular with the so-called bro vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Touring the fraternities here in Ann Arbor, the Trump strategy appears to be making a splash with students.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's been doing loads of different podcasts and stuff.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Like, him being with, like, Nelk in the podcast stuff, he...it definitely reaches us.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's smart, good marketing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's more personable, too, you get to see what he's really like, you know: honestly, it just feels like he's being honest.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's not being set up, it's not in front of a news media where, you know, sometimes, you know, you see those fake narratives and stuff.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's a tough one to answer, i think he's more dominant, he's more, uh... Go away!",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Other leaders fear him, you know: he gets the word across.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump is trying to breach that divide, reaching out to black men, traditional Democrats that poll suggest could switch over to his side.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump, for his part, still managed to underperform what we would expect for a major party leading candidate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump disqualified from the Illinois ballot: he had been disqualified by a judge.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, well, the court appearance has certainly helped him with his political base, which has helped him to secure a renomination with the Republican Party.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So while it has been beneficial to him thus far, once he's locked up the nomination, these repeated court cases are going to prove to be a little bit more of a drag.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump is right on the line there at 50-47.,Donald Trump,Michigan
They understand that they've got to better define themselves.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
They know where their target audiences are.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
They're working it.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And then what's the best mechanism in your mind for them to do that: i know there's a lot of paid advertising.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And you've got to, i don't think people know Kamala Harris yet.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I do, i don't think she's how great she is.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
We all know who Donald Trump is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But he is who he is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's passionate.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And he says what he thinks, and people know him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think she's trying to do that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's doing more media interviews.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's doing different places.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
We've seen a lot of discussion identified this a couple of months ago is young black men who... And it's not her problem.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So Trump is right on the line there at 50-47.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"For every one Harris wall sign, within a three minute period, I will see at least, and this is minimum, at least five Trump signs after I see one Harris sign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I will see Trump signs back to back to back to back.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And from when I got into the subdivision, to when I left, which took me about two and a half minutes, I seen 10 Trump signs in Metro Detroit.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I can see how she gets Wayne County, but I don't see how she's gonna get Oakland.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't see how she's gonna get Macomb.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't see how she's gonna get even these other areas.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, there's some liberal like cities and stuff, but I don't see how she's gonna win Michigan, yo.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I'm not on the electoral board, but from what I see driving around the last couple of months, nothing, but Trump signs everywhere.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If she wins it or not, I don't think she's gonna win Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So even including myself, I didn't give Donald Trump the 2016 vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But from what I'm seeing now, she's losing momentum.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She's losing momentum in the polls.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So she hasn't found a way to separate her way from Biden.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"She has not, she's constantly still running on continuation of what's going on.",Donald Trump,Michigan
People in your orbit who are either voting for Donald Trump or considering it: for sure.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And Trump is kind of all we know.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Odds are you know quite a bit about January 6th and the litany of criminal and civil cases brought against Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is an amazing clip, has all of the felonies and indictments against Trump has, has that worked to persuade voters actually has made him more popular.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Does anybody have any idea about what's happening in the federal courts relating to Donald Trump's the January 6th event and what's going on there with Trump: wait, let's just let me, I'm sorry to keep going back to you, but so like, you haven't talked to me about your level of interest in the criminal charges and so forth.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, nobody should be able to dictate that at all, and what do you think of Trump's position on abortion, i think he's anti, isn't he: yeah.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He wants to control that, yeah, well, I don't think he has any business even talking about it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So I'd like that to change, do you feel like Donald Trump's going to be better on that issue: based on what we've seen on his first four years, I do believe that he will be better on that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Is there anything that Vice President Harris could do at this point to change your mind: not particularly, no.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Unless she changes her stance completely on fixing the border.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It is exactly these answers, which is why Donald Trump is now winning effectively on all of the swing states.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump is winning in many national polls now.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Could Donald Trump win the popular vote: well, he is a populist candidate and populism is popular.",Donald Trump,Michigan
In 2016 Donald Trump won the state by just 0.22 percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Currently in the 2024 head-to-head national polling average between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, Harris holds a 0.9 percent national lead over Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
However even though Harris ahead this is not the best news for her as that would be less than half of what Hillary Clinton got in 2016 when she won the popular vote by 2.1 percent but lost the electoral college.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris based on the national polls is projecting to do even worse than Hillary Clinton did in 2016 if all things remain true.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Nate Silver's Bolton has Kamala Harris leading 0.6 percent.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
270 to win has Donald Trump leading 0.4 percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Decisintesk HQ, The Hill has Trump leading 0.6 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And 538 has Harris leading 0.1 percent, certainly a very very close race back and forth.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
That three out of the five forecasters do have Trump ahead so Trump is narrowly favored in this category but it is incredibly incredibly close.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And we're looking at a margins of just a few tenths of percentage points are deciding if Trump or Harris is leading in Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"As for national, Trump currently has 64.3 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump got over 264,000 votes from Wayne County.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump got 325,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump got over 56,000 in this county.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And if Harris is able to match the margins that Biden had in 2020.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris's job in Michigan is to try and match what Joe Biden did.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"In 2020, Trump had over 260,000 votes in this county.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And Trump needs to likely get back to the 2016 numbers of around 11 and a half, 12 percent range in the margin of victory in this county to be able to win Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump had 98,000, and this will be another not as solid Democratic area as, say, Wayne or Oakland, but it will be a good area to look at in terms of how Kamala Harris is running among Democratic voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But the question is, by how much: if that 9.3 percent or 9.5 percent is like a six or seven percent number margin of victory, that could be a sign Trump is doing much better than expected in an area like this and could be better overall statewide.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Harris is doing above 9.3, that could be a sign that maybe her voter turnout was up and she is overperforming what we many expected in the state of Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump got 165,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump won it by 3.1.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Once again, if Trump is winning this county, then or overperforming the 6.1 percent for Biden, that could be a very good sign that Trump is running well ahead.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Of his 2020 numbers in Michigan, if Harris is keeping pace at 6.1 or doing better, that is obviously a very good sign for her.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"34.3 for Romney, 30.5 for Trump in 2016, and then 21.5 for Trump in 2020, trump needs to get these numbers back up to the 2016 30.5 percent chance, or 20, 30.5 percent to have a chance at winning Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Where does Harris end up performing on election night: that is what we're watching for.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And Donald Trump got 47.8 percent of the statewide vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is a very close county in 2020, only 0.6 percent separating Trump and Biden in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is a smaller one where Trump got about 14,000 votes in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Looking at the 2016 map where Donald Trump won the state, he had 47.5% of the statewide vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump won this county in 2016, lost it in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump won this county in 2016.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Macomb County 53.6 to 42.1 a win for Trump, oakland County 51.6 to 43.5 a win for Clinton.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So even though he lost the state, he did perform better in Michigan than he did in 2016.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In 2016, Trump when he won the state got 47.5%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"However, we're not used to seeing in Michigan Trump being up 1.2% in the state compared to the polling in 2016 and 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
That factor goes for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The head-to-head national polling data, yes, Kamala Harris is leading by 0.9%, but that would be the closest popular vote margin in any of the last few elections and by a lot.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So that certainly benefits Donald Trump and would lead to a likely electoral college win for Trump and a popular vote defeat.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Now Trump is leading here by 1.2%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump has been gaining a lot in the polls in every single swing state around the country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"That is certainly a benefit for Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So that does benefit Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump won it by 0.22 in 2016.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump would still be favored based on all the factors to win the state of Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I just think Trump is first of all going to likely overperform what he got in 2016 and 2020 in the state of Michigan, 47.8.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's almost certainly going to outperform that, the question is, how much does he outperform it by and what does it end up being: so the Republican and the Democratic numbers are kind of hard to guess in Michigan, seeing as there's really not a track record for a Republican getting over 50% of the vote in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That has not happened yet, if Trump doesn't on election night, he'll be the first Republican in Michigan to do that, I think since the 1980s.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I think Kamala Harris, she's not going to do, she's not going to be bad enough, like Hillary Clinton was in the state of Michigan in 2016, where it's 47.3%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I don't think she's going to go quite that low.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If she did, I wouldn't be terribly shocked, but I don't think she's going to perform that poorly in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I think 48.3 is kind of a respectable number where she's not performing where she needs to, but she's also not getting blown out in a swing state that has a past of being a Democratic state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"In the margin of victory of 1.1%, it aligns right now where Harris is leading the national vote by 0.9, and the average popular vote difference in Michigan was 1.96.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I still have a lot of states to go, including most of the states in the Northeast and New England that are going to be Democratic states for Kamala Harris, so that big number of like 150 electoral votes separating Harris and Trump is going to go down very, very quickly.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Do you think that's Kamala Harris then: yes, I do.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I like her perspective on taking care of everyone in the United States and everything.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
What is it about Trump that just says no: he's an idiot.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He is an idiot.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"With just over a week until election day, new polling is showing Vice President Kamala Harris with a slight edge over Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"A new ABC News poll among likely voters has Harris up by four points, 51% to 47%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
The poll also shows Harris ahead of Trump among key demographics.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Let's go through them, harris leads Trump by 30 points among Latino voters, a group that Biden won by a similar 33 points in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"According to ABC News exit polling, Harris also has a 19 point lead among suburban women, a six point gain from Biden in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Among black voters, Harris is outperforming Biden's 2020 margin with black men by 14 points and by seven points with black women.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"With college graduates, Harris has a 10 point gain from Biden in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"When it comes to white men with college degrees, Trump won the group by three points in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But now Harris is winning by four points in this poll.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And for white women with college degrees, Harris is winning by 14 points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's more than Biden in 2020, on top issues, Harris leads by six points when it comes to looking out for the middle class and by 10 points when it comes to health care.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris leads Trump by 11 points in being seen as having the mental sharpness it takes to effectively serve as president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Meanwhile, more voters think Trump is more likely to say that things are not true.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The poll also found registered voters are more than twice as likely to call Donald Trump a fascist than to say the same about Kamala Harris.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Joe, what do you make of these numbers: there's a lot of other information to bring in and also what appears to be the closing argument by the Trump side and that contrast with the Harris campaign.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, Donald Trump can win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Everybody in his campaign thinks he can win.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Every Republican in America, except those that are quietly voting for Kamala Harris, are running around saying he's going to win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They have, i haven't seen a side this confident since Mitt Romney's side in 2012 knew he was going to beat Barack Obama.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And they just kept saying that they were they were so sure they're going to win that it was Mitt Romney and Karl Rove who were shocked on election night and knew something had to be wrong with numbers because they weren't winning.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So the bubble inside Trump world is overwhelming, saying that Donald Trump is going to win this race.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I've told Donald Trump and the distant past and other people in his administration, politics is about addition.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But you have trend lines going the way the Harris campaign would obviously want it to be.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I think the number I keep going back to and it's a number that I have been looking at for three years now, if Donald Trump is going to run.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And the number is forty seven, donald Trump is at forty seven percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump is at forty eight percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's not happening now, so I guess if Harris does win and she has a four point lead like fifty one to forty seven, everybody's going to go, you know, why: of course, you idiots.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
There was he was never going to get over forty seven percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Maybe we'll be saying that, but I still think that's the question for Donald Trump to win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is not even 40 years ago, he's going to have to get forty eight forty nine percent most likely in the national poll.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But but still, that's where I'm still suck, he's got a hard ceiling.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"How does he win with forty seven percent of the vote nationally, even as you project that toward electoral college votes: joey doesn't.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And Donald Trump is giving you that repeatedly.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But it's crazy, i don't know if it's a pose, but Donald Trump, the people around Donald Trump, the Trump campaign, everybody else, they have been crowing that they've got this in the bag for three months now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And, you know, there's this 10 mile square square mile logic free zone called Washington, D.C. And in Washington, D.C., people are like, oh, look at the momentum Trump has.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, it's a wonderful decision that she's making to support the community and show that she's a good president.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Girl power, she could never have imagined the possibility of Madam President looking like this.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You see momentum for Harris in every single one of the major battleground states, including the big three, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Harris now slightly favored in the 538 polling average in all three.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And as she turns to her choice for running mate, we're seeing that most Americans don't really have an opinion of any of them, but to the extent they do, we're seeing some relatively positive numbers for people, including Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He has 49% of the vote, while Harris holds 47%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"New Hampshire, Harris is ahead in New Hampshire by 9 points, holding 51% of the vote to Trump's 42%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She has 47.9% of the vote, while Trump holds 47.6%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She has 59% of the vote compared to Trump's 34.3%, giving her a 24.7-point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Nebraska's 2nd District, Harris has an 8.4-point lead in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, holding 50.7% of the vote compared to Trump's 42.3%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"New York, in New York, Harris holds a 13.5-point lead, with 54.5% of the vote to Trump's 41%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Rhode Island, Harris leads in Rhode Island by 16.5 points, with 57% of the vote compared to Trump's 40.5%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He gave non-union workers signs that said union workers for Trump, then he told them that they're picketing for the wrong reasons.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And at the same time, Trump was saying that in Michigan, six miles from where he was standing, there was a gigantic auto plant being built at that exact moment.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Does Donald Trump's rhetoric on the auto industry meet the reality: it does not.,Donald Trump,Michigan
There are many times where he talks in broad terms that the auto industry in the US is going to just go into complete collapse and it just is not the reality.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He is kind of actively out trashing the transition to electric vehicles and then turns around and praises Tesla and calls those EVs beautiful.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so this was a really interesting moment where he's in essentially a bedroom community of Lansing, Michigan that has two major general motors plants.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"One is out in Delta Township, which was six miles away from where he's standing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so here you had Trump, he was trashing the Infra- the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, but that IRA, that law is providing a $500 million grant to General Motors to convert that Lansing Grand River plant to an EV plant in the future.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And as we know from the record, the person who cast the tie breaking vote for the infrastructure, or excuse me, the Inflation Reduction Act was Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What do you make of that: and what I'm specifically referring to is, the rhetoric there of the Chinese supplier, that actually is, you know, and you correct me if I'm wrong, you're an expert creating jobs in the area that he says he wants shut down, but then wants to bring in manufacturing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Could you elaborate on that: yeah, so this is a case where I think Trump gets kind of like tied up in his own trade rhetoric and doesn't follow the sort of pathway to what he's talking about.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so he's out talking on the campaign trail, I'm gonna put 100, 200% tariff on these Chinese EV car makers that are building plants and building cars in Mexico, and then gonna try to export them into the US.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump should know that, and he definitely knows that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's the self-proclaimed king of debt.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And we actually checked to make sure that this Alro steel that he was at, they're not a supplier, at least known to be a supplier for these two major projects, which would have been kind of a sort of red flag.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So I'm dating back to Trump's term in office.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And that's another thing that I kind of keep noticing when Trump talks about the auto industry.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Chad, finally, when I was watching Donald Trump speak at that factory, I couldn't help but notice the people who were behind him, who were from time to time, they looked a little confused by some of the things.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But when he's saying these things, and again, it can't possibly match the reality of what their experience is in that factory though.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So when he goes in there, and you're reporting, I mean, are they okay just being used as a prop to basically trash their own future, because the things that he's saying is actually antithetical to their business planning, right: i mean, in their bottom line.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But when you ask him like broadly, who's better at the economy, Trump or Harris, they say Trump, but then you start asking him like personality traits and who do you trust, who's smarter, who has your values at stake, and they say Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that's just the reality, and so how he threads this needle of trashing, the EVs and claiming the entire auto industry is gonna collapse, and then tries to go tell people in Oakland County, everything's gonna be fine with your future.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Maybe this is the fear that he's looking for to try to capitalize on.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Four years before that, Trump took it from the Democrats by just 10,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It would have never happened, iran was broke under Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I'm still undecided, do you like Donald Trump: yeah.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Fine, do you know: because I think he's like fighter.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's like fighter, fighter man.",Donald Trump,Michigan
What's Donald Trump's answer to the Gaza war: he is a convenient line for both sides.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And he loves telling Michigan's voters all about his daughter Tiffany's new Arab husband, Michael Bulos, the son of a Lebanese billionaire.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump in 2016: 2016, trump in 2020, and then 2024, again: again, are you sure: yes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We like him.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump says he's going to deport 15 million illegal migrants.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The last time he was president, he banned Muslims from coming into the US from six different Muslim countries.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So he said a lot and done less.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Again, he's coming from a business perspective.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I wouldn't really believe he would do that as much like, you know, he's just saying it to back outskipping.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If he does that, he'll be, like, you know, impacting the economy.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And this is not really one of his goals, so to summarise, you're going to vote for Trump because he's not going to do precisely what he says he's going to do.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris is doing her best to reset.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She skipped Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress and talks much more about the Palestinians suffering in Gaza, but no changes yet to US policy on the war.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And that's her problem, but it too much to the palace and inside and she risks alienating America's 7.5 million Jewish voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's not connecting because they see what all of us see.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala just doesn't kind of jive with the blue collar voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She doesn't connect with the middle class.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
They see through her lame campaign of joy and all of her biographical bloviating.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And now the Trump campaign is practically making Michigan its second home.,Donald Trump,Michigan
The Trump Republican Party is the party of the American worker and it's also the party of common sense.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And it always will be, now, let's take a look at how Trump has done in Michigan historically.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In 2016, he won the state by just 0.3 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And we responded by recognizing that the way the Obama administration was leading the country is exactly the way the Harris administration has been leading the country right into a ditch.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And he's focused on fixing America starting right here in the center of the electoral universe right here in Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Currently, Trump and Harris are tied in the 40s.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Wow, that is wild, congressman, if he's able to pull over some of the Arab American voters, how big of an impact will that have in the final tally here: i'll tell you what, to your last question, the most critical area in this entire state, in my opinion right now, is Macomb County.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That is disqualifying for anyone, so President Trump is building his coalition.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's starting in Macomb County, spreading through Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They've updated their polls and they've got Donald Trump up by two now.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That was their last poll back in mid-September.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump is sitting plus eight when you combine all the battleground states and all their polling.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And I would imagine Harris acts if they've got this.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I said that once the other Harris poll gets knocked off because that Harris X poll that was in the aggregate and now it's not anymore.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And so now Kamala is only sitting plus point six.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris is back up to plus two, it had Trump plus two a few days ago.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Now Kamala's lead is down to point six.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Biden was plus eight, hillary was plus six.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump is the ultimate closer.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And this is going to be an epic swing if Trump actually takes the lead in terms of the popular vote seriously.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's this TIPP if they had a Trump plus two, I think it'd be like Harris plus point two or point one at this point in terms of the spread that CBS news poll is going to get knocked off next and it's a Harris plus three.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You're going to be accurate, harris is not winning Michigan by one point, let alone four points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Now Trump's down to plus point six and you've got liberals left and right.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Her internal campaign reported it.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And now she's not even doing rallies.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Hillary was plus six, she lost.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now Trump's plus point one, he's obviously pulling a lot better.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Holy crap, trump went up from 60 was 66 down to 61 back up to 63.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's it's Trump's leading all these swing states if Trump's up eight, but they combine them, it's like, why see, why are we combining these: this doesn't make any sense.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's very good, and I do think that I mean, every swing state to me looks good for Trump and really all these polls, you know, you get Quinnipiac.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, Harris is not going to win Michigan by four and then Wisconsin be a tie.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"More likely than not, all the top experts have come together and said Trump probably two and a half point victory in Michigan, probably about a two point victory in Wisconsin and like a three point two victory in Pennsylvania with the Elon Musk factor and everything and all the free speech and all the threats and all the assault against Trump and the assassination attempt and all it all comes together in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And Trump probably wins by around three point two.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"How big of a lead does he have: well, it's a tiny lead right now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"However, it's the biggest news in our polling this month because for the very first time, Trump has moved ahead of Joe Biden in all seven of the swing states we are polling.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump won with 47.8, so Michigan is always tight.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And right now, with 11 months to go, Trump is ahead in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
One place where we recently saw Trump and Biden trying to woo Michigan voters was when the auto workers went on strike.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I talked to Brian Pennevicker, who is part of the group Auto Workers for Trump, and he kind of sums up why he thinks Biden is starting to lose some ground with the auto workers.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And that's when Trump was president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And they are thinking about a pre-COVID world when Donald Trump was running the country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Wendy, what do you think about that: i think Trump has always had trouble gaining the support of suburban women, but this time he has taken what seems to be a very smart self-marketing strategy in hitting on one issue that suburban women see as important besides the economy, and that is the importance of abortion.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so Trump, who has always campaigned as a devotee of the evangelical Christian right, has taken a very moderate or more to the point vague stance on where he stands on abortion rights.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Then you have the rural areas where Trump has a tremendous amount of support.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump won the election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Compare that to just a few weeks ago when Harris held a two-point lead.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Where is Trump picking up that support: yeah, so like you said, we see Trump at 49%, Harris at 48%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So we're seeing an independent split here among these independent voters, Trump slightly winning these voters 47 to 45.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So you can kind of see how some of these independent voters may prefer a Trump approach to some of these issues, the economy and immigration, those being winning issues for Donald Trump across the swing states.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I'm scared, president Trump has asked me to reorganize the federal health agencies, the agencies that have a portfolio that affects human health, which is CDC, NIH, FDA, as well as some of the agencies within the United States Department of Agriculture.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's been talking that way to me for 21 years.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Vice President Harris is up by 12 points in that district.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But I think the enthusiasm and the interest in people coming here to see President Trump shows the capture that he has with people, especially in small towns throughout our country, but really here in Michigan, which ranks as certainly probably the top or top one or two most competitive swing state in the country.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And certainly I would argue just about no one else in the world right now has a higher profile than Donald Trump today.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And I'm thankful that President Trump isn't hiding the way that Kamala Harris is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's willing to go out and engage with members of the media.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's willing to engage with members of the public.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he's not hiding away from who he is or what his vision for America is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Whereas Donald Trump is fully in command, not only of the issues and division that he has for America, but his willingness to go out and share that with people and share that with the media as well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris has not broken with Biden over Israel's conduct of the war.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Some regard her as complicit in Israel's bombardment of Gaza and Lebanon, which has targeted Hamas and Hezbollah while inflicting terrible damage on civilians.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"This issue did not go away, i don't know if some in the Harris camp thought that it would.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's still there, will this prevent her from being the next president: i sure hope not, Connell.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I think she's going to win Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I do feel that Kamala Harris will be different.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And you can't vote third party because Kamala Harris has shown her compassion and her empathy here.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's the vice president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's not the president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She doesn't make policy now.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And, you know, take the 15 seconds to fill in her name on the Oval on November 5th.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And then on November 6th, you can go right back to pressuring her because you can, you know, pressure her.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"With Donald Trump, forget it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's the only president, Connell, he's the only president in modern times, Republican or Democratic, who disposed of the idea of Palestinian self-determination altogether.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He would be fine with annexation, right: he eliminated the Palestinian mission in Washington.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He eliminated the U.S. mission in East Jerusalem to Palestinians and on and on.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Staying home is a vote for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The only vote that's not for, in my view, you know, possible fascism in America is a vote for Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Steph, is that the way that you're reading it at the moment, that the dial has turned slightly to Donald Trump: he has certainly made some ground in some of the key battleground states that he would have to win in November to win the electoral college, specifically in Michigan and Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Michigan
This has had only recently been slightly outperforming Trump in some of these polls.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And also the shift from President Biden at the top of the ticket to Vice President Harris at the top of the ticket also means that there are slightly different states at play because of the different appeal that Harris may have compared to Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Now Kamala Harris has been criticized about not doing as many interviews as she possibly could the last week.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's done quite a number.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
You've yet to see a real press conference setting where Harris is willing to take a lot of questions from the media.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's gone on The View.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's gone on Women Focus podcast, but she did do her 60-minute interview as well.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There has been some mixed reviews, one question that I know I've been hearing a lot of concerns over is when she was asked, how would she be different from a Biden administration: she was asked that on The View.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She didn't really have a good answer.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She said she couldn't really think of anything in particular.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Then she was asked again with Stephen Colbert, how would she be different from Biden: again, she kind of just pushed off the question.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There is a significant number of voters in the country, in the U.S. right now, who want to hear how she would be different from President Biden.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's really what's at stake right now, she is still trying to define herself as a candidate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She has been trying to leave behind some of the more progressive policies she has endorsed in her past and make an appeal to independent voters, particularly the video we just watched.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's very clearly trying to win over moderate voters, trying to move away from her progressive past, but it's still unclear exactly how she views her potential presidency as different from Biden's presidency.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
A continual problem for Donald Trump has been his inability to attack properly the vice president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He still doesn't seem to have got that right at this point.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Amidst all of that, he doesn't want another debate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He does not, i mean, this is probably because of the way the first debate went between Harris and Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It was very clear that Harris won that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
It was probably one of her strongest moments since she became the presidential nominee.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Of course, Trump doesn't want to risk another bad performance in a debate as we get closer and closer to that November 5th Election Day.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We'll see whether he ends up caving and deciding he wants to kind of go at it again and maybe reclaim some of his debating skills there and try again and convince American people that he's the person they should be voting for.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But it has been very tricky for the former president to find clear ways of attacking Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He has tended to devolve into more personal attacks that have not gone over well, even within his own party.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I know I've spoken to Republican members of Congress who have been concerned with Trump's tendency to get into the personal realm, to talk about Kamala Harris's race or ethnicity rather than focusing on the policy issues, which is where Republicans feel like they have a real argument to make to the American people.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If you look at the overall aggregate average, we saw the states in which Trump was leading by over a point get tighter and we saw the states in which Kamala was leading by a point get tighter.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But I will say, I do think there will be a slight polling error in Trump's favor when it comes to the popular vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump might only lose the popular vote by around one.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I know some people think Trump could win the popular vote and he could because of the improvements he's shown in a New York, in a New Jersey, in an Illinois, extending his lead in Florida, extending his lead in Ohio.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now you're down by 1.8, if the election finished and there was zero error on the popular vote to where Trump lost it by 1.8, that would very likely be an electoral college victory for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Although the votes are going to be, it's going to be a little bit different cause Trump's going to make up significant ground in New York, New Jersey, states like that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's not going to be the crazy, you know, like we saw in 2020 where Trump lost the popular vote by four points.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He might only lose it this cycle by 21, 22.",Donald Trump,Michigan
There is a potential chance where Kamala could win the popular vote by two and still win the election.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Like most of Harris's betting numbers have recently, that's the big story.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
The betting is trending heavily in Trump's direction.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The polls are getting very, very close, but the betting is what Trump is, is doing really well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And you can see there was that new New York Times, Siena poll that some weird data off of that, especially off of the Pennsylvania poll, it does help Trump in the average in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's sitting plus one in Arizona.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I do like where Trump is at this point.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He was up around two points.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But I think Trump is looking very, very good in Arizona and he's pulling a lot better than he was in 2020 than he was in 2016.",Donald Trump,Michigan
This is another state where Trump getting that wall street journal poll really helps him out.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I do think that Trump could win this state.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But I do think Trump is probably going to win the state by around point four to point five.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Even if Trump loses it, you're talking about 306 electoral votes versus 312.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If he's able to sweep all the other swing states, it's not that big of a deal.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If he does lose this one, there was more positive pulling for Kamala.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She was up by around a point for about half a month.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She was leading most of the polls.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But you get that Trump plus six liberals could say, well, that's an outlier.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But in general, it's not like Harris was up by five anyways.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's really all I can say about that, wisconsin Harris sitting not even up half a point.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
The bedding is trending in Trump's direction.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He ended up only winning by point three.,Donald Trump,Michigan
We saw an over six point polling error because Trump won Wisconsin in 2016.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He lost it in 2020.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump supporters, i think this is going to be a very good election victory for Trump in Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, look at this, harris was up when they started to really ramp her up and you had the DNC and everything like that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
You're getting Jill Stein possibly helping Trump out Jill Stein winning the Muslim vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump ended up winning the state by point three percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And this is another state that has underestimated Trump in the past.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump won Michigan in 2016.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Pretty crazy there, again, another state where it seems like the data would check out based off of the previous Trump elections to where Trump is sitting in a very, very good spot in Michigan because you could say he's up by a point.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So it's an even better spot to where he might be up by around two or three.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump's not going to win the state by seven or eight, but he might get some more breathing room if he's up or even if he's down by one.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But Trump sitting plus point one, basically 50 50.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, you do have Trump leading three out of the last four polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"There was a Quinnipiac plus two, but even these I mean, most of these most of these polls Trump is leading that Bloomberg poll is it still in the average Harris plus five.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump overperformed Pennsylvania very easily.,Donald Trump,Michigan
You do have Trump sitting plus point five.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump plus one plus one plus two plus one plus one plus two, so he's leading all these polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Once that gets knocked off, Trump's probably going to go up to around a one point lead in terms of the average.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump won the state in 2020 by one point three.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So now Trump's sitting plus point five.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I do think Trump is probably you can see Trump was up one point five there.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I don't know, was it that Fox News poll that really changed it: or maybe there was a poll that got taken out of the aggregate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, some of these polls that had Trump up by four and three got taken out, I guess.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I know Trump recently went ahead.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's basically 50 50, but Trump may be 51.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Pennsylvania Trump like a 55 percent chance, trump is looking good in all of these states right now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And he is, I believe, an existential threat to America's labor movement.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So you add that, think about that, you add that to then a few days later Harris not going to the dinner in DC and then mocking Catholicism with the Molly Shannon skit.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"All this great Kellyanne Conway, former counselor to President Trump, Fox News contributor, my great friend Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor, welcome very much to both of you.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But those were all Trump accomplishments.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So why go for a facsimile when you can get the real thing: and now that you have the real thing, I think Kamala Harris does not sound credible or compelling when she tries to go right at the guy who had a success of four years on the border, on the economy, on energy independence and the rest.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Look, I think she's playing it all wrong.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If I were Kamala Harris, I would have stuck with Biden Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And all that people would have seen was different, was not her position on fracking or middle class tax cuts or Trump's border wall, but she hasn't paid advertising.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I think at least enough, oh, boy, where's the joy: this person said that she's bringing back joy to politics.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Yeah, it's true, but Trump's got great joy on the job.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Larry and Newt, he's out there every day mixing up with the folks.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's in his spamming town hall.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump looks like a winner.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Kelly, he's in Coachella.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump, he looks like a winner.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He wants you to.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He looks like a winner.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's a metaphor for America.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't know if he's a winner.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris looked all crunched up and then got very overexcited waving her arm.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She lost the even keel temperament that you're supposed to have to be a president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I think it's because either she's not telling the truth or she doesn't want to do it or all she wants to do is attack the unstable and unhinged.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That's what she calls Trump.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Or am I wrong, am I missing something with two and a half weeks: well, as long as Trump stays focused on drawing the contrast both in policy and performance, she's going to lose.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think she's not very competent.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But given that, she's probably playing a losing hand about as reasonably as you can play it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She can't talk about policy because if she's clear, either her base will rebel or the country will repudiate her.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She can't talk about performance because the contrast between Biden, Harris and Trump is so unbelievably bad she can't do it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So she has one choice, attack Trump, which also doesn't work partially because of what Kelly Ann said, which is sort of like I thought Mike Johnson, the speaker was great on Sunday.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"One of the reporters of the current fad was saying, well, Trump didn't release his medical records and don't you want to know what his cholesterol is, and Johnson said, this guy got shot and stood back up and raised his fist in the air and said, fight and you want me to worry about his health: you know, so the problem is Trump has a great record, a great proposal, a strong personality.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"She has a lousy record, a lousy proposal and an incompetent personality.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And of course, many of the younger people who are giving Trump an outlook, Jewish Americans, I think Trump's going to do very well in some of these suburbs around major cities.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so he doesn't look, i just mentioned groups.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump doesn't need to win 50 percent of any of those groups to be the next president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And part of the message, Larry and Newt, is because he's saying, come along.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's unifying, yeah, you know, he just needs to cut those margins.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump triumphs in Michigan, the former president scored a major legal victory after a Michigan appeals court rejected challenges to keep him off the 2024 primary ballot.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump challengers in Michigan and Minnesota hope to convince courts that Trump shouldn't be allowed to be on the ballot.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Nationally, a new poll by Arab News and YouGov found that Trump is leading the vice president 45 to 43 percent among Arab Americans.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, I will say you try to merge the two in a Trump election because Trump tends to pull more from a registered voter pool of lower likely and low propensity voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump is doing very well with people in the auto industry because of his pledge to get rid of the electric vehicle mandate and do not underestimate the power of how Donald Trump is going to win the Arab Muslim vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan

"Look, if men will rise up in the next six days, Donald Trump is going to win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That gap can be closed, however, that is Kamala Harris' big play.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So in 2020, when Donald Trump fell 80,000 votes short, the Democrats build what is called a blue firewall.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So Donald Trump, therefore, has to overcome 700,000 less votes on election day than he did in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I think Donald Trump, I'm going to call it right now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think Donald Trump might win Scranton.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I think he might actually win that county.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And Donald Trump only fell 80000 votes short back then.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Today has to be, what is it, the no good, very bad, rotten, dirty, whatever day for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"As he sits in court, day after day, being tortured as Jesse Waters refers to it, he is being in greater legal jeopardy in other states as we go.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So it's not just the federal cases that he's facing right now, it's not just the documents case or the election interference, January 6th case, it's not just the Georgia election interference case, it's not just the Manhattan hush money case or the civil case with the attorney general there.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And it just, I wish people would dispense with that attitude and that line of thinking because if Donald Trump had been put back into office extra democratically, extra constitutionally, that would have ended democracy, that wouldn't have been a democratic manner with which to be placed in office.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He didn't win the election, democracy would be over or at least a path to not using democracy to install leaders in our country.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump is a co-conspirator in Michigan's 2020 false electors plot, state investigator says.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Howard Shock, a special agent for Nessel, said Trump, Mark Meadows, who was Trump's chief of staff and Rudy Giuliani, who was his personal lawyer, are considered quote unquote unindicted co-conspirators in Michigan's false electors case.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump is set to be the Republican presidential nominee this fall and final paragraph here, Shock also said yes, uh, that they are a co-conspirator, uh, to former Michigan Republican party chairwoman Laura Cox and the names of other Michigan Republicans including former state house speaker Tom Leonard, his wife Janelle Leonard, and Stu Sandler, a GOP consultant and legal advisor to Cox.",Donald Trump,Michigan

Lester aides say that Harris will ask voters to imagine America under a Trump presidency or a Harris presidency that he would have a grievance list about himself where she would have a to do list about the American people.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And they say she chose tomorrow's location in Washington because that is where Mr. Trump had urged his supporters to march to the Capitol on January 6th.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It is that bad, now, I want to be clear that I am not saying for sure that Trump is gonna win Michigan by 15 points, or it's a foregone conclusion Trump's gonna win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, one of the most accurate pollsters out there, and I know some people don't like him, but when you look at his history and his track record, he's pretty damn good.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, he just dropped a Trump plus three and a half out of Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump plus two, big data, Trump plus two, but of course it was like it ended up being Trump plus three and a half.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"No, there's only been one pollster in the last couple of weeks to even have Harris winning.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump is winning and not just by a point.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's like Trump plus two, Trump plus three, Trump plus four.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, for crying out loud, the clear outlier is National Research, which found Harris plus three.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So the fact that Trump is not just barely losing Michigan, no, he's outright winning Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"No, it's Trump plus three to Trump plus four and he's at 48 to 49 percent of vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Big Dad, of Rasmussen, Atlas Intel, they're all showing virtually the same thing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump is the favorite in Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And if he's winning Michigan, more than likely, he's winning Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's winning Wisconsin.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He looked the electoral map.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Trump wins Michigan, well, at that point, he just needs Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona.",Donald Trump,Michigan
That's all he needs to win the presidency.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But like I said, if he's really winning Michigan, like this poll shown by four points, in what universe does Trump win Michigan but by some miracle lose Wisconsin or even Pennsylvania, do you really think, or even states like Arizona, do you really think, that Trump would do five points better in Michigan: and I know there is a big X factor in the state we'll get to in a second.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But do you really think Trump would do that much worse in Wisconsin, but that much better in Michigan: i highly doubt it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So at the end of the day, he's for sure winning Michigan by fourth.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"At that point, he's pretty much a guarantee to win Wisconsin, pretty much a guarantee to win Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"At that point, he doesn't even need Arizona.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Hell, he doesn't even need Georgia.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He just needs North Carolina and well, he's the next president.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's not, and it's only a one point lead that could change next week.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But do you really think there's be a four point miss here, especially when every other halfway decent pollster has a Trump lead, did you really think that's going to happen: i don't think so.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's it, everyone else is showing Trump plus two, Trump plus three, Trump plus four.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"These are big leads, now, some of you might be asking yourselves, well, oh, okay, how could Trump be doing so good in Michigan: after all, back in 2020, it was the most Democrat leaning state of the Rust Belt states, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So how the hell could Trump be doing so good here: all right, because it's a big deal for Trump to win Michigan by four.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So that means if Trump wins Michigan by three or two, he's probably winning Wisconsin by one or two.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Something like that, i'm not saying a five-point difference, that's not going to happen, but I could see a scenario play out where he can do the best, not in Pennsylvania, not in Wisconsin, but in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"No, she doesn't, biden had a unique appeal because he grifted off being the Scranton Joe.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's a fact, what does Harris have: she has nothing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She has no appeal to these voters at all.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump would have been doing like 20 to 30 points better just with Union voters just to maybe account for a five point shift.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I think that's a big reason why Trump is doing so much better here, but it doesn't really explain why Trump is doing five to 10 points better in Michigan, especially compared to Wisconsin or even Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I would argue that the main reason why Trump is doing so much better in Michigan, possibly compared to Wisconsin, is the fact that the war in Israel is having a much bigger impact for Democrats in Michigan compared to say Wisconsin or Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I really believe that's the number one reason why Trump is doing way better in Michigan, especially compared to Pennsylvania or Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It'd be much more stable than what's happening right now, with Kamala Harris, God knows what you're getting.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Demographically speaking, Harris has a big problem in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
That's the number one reason why I think Harris is in deep trouble here.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She may not lose by four points, but there's not a single demographic that is critical in Michigan that's actually shifting towards her.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If you're banking on a four-point miss in favor of Harris, not even towards Trump, which would actually make sense because it happened two times in a row.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And if that's the case, her pathway to the presidency is all but gone.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Because if we assume Trump's winning North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona, well, Michigan gets him over the top.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She's in deep trouble in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If she loses that state, it's all but over.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
This election's all but done if she loses Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think I'm right in saying that last month you did make a call and you said that you thought Kamala Harris was going to win.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And I have not changed my prediction of Kamala Harris win, despite all the vicissitudes of the campaign, which have gone in both directions.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Let's not forget, you know, Harris whipped him badly in the debate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And if you could summarize, you know, why you think it's the case that she's likely to be elected, what is it: yes, I have 13 keys that have been right since I predicted Ronald Reagan's reelection in April 1982, nearly three years ahead of time, when 60 percent of Americans said he was too old to run again.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"We're talking about a once in a generation, inspirational across-the-board candidate like Franklin Roosevelt, the Democrat or Ronald Reagan, the Republican, whatever you may think of Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's only been a candidate for a little while.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She hasn't risen to a status of an FDR.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So that's four keys down, two keys short of predicting Trump returning to the White House and Harris losing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yes, that was the same thing in 2016, where I defied the pollsters and all of the conventional wisdom to predict a Donald Trump win in the election, which did not make me popular in 90 percent plus Democratic Washington, D.C., where I teach at American University.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But I did get a note after the election on the Washington Post article where I predicted Trump's win.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Have you had any abuse from Donald Trump for coming out against him this time: no, but I have to tell you, I have never experienced, and I've been doing this, as I told you, since 1982.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I have to say, I attribute this to the toxic politics of violence and disorder promoted by Donald Trump before Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Um, to be honest... Oh, Chompo Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Holy shit, she's probably the lesser of the evil, but, i don't think I'm gonna vote for either one.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Oh, Chompo Harris, for sure, why: i haven't seen you.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Just because I've seen Trump as the president, you feel me, i mean, yeah, it's cheaper, you feel me: but I just, i feel like she would be a better president.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump, you wanna know why: because Trump supposed to be the Lord of Texas.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris, why: she just stands for what I believe in.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Imagine that, this is, of course, in stark contrast with the last debate earlier in September in which ABC moderators David Muir and Lindsay Davis corrected Trump's inaccurate statements four times, but they did not do the same thing for Kamala Harris, even though she also made some misstatements.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Stoking anger from Trump and his supporters and, I would say, some objective media watchers, perhaps, like myself.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Let's watch, biden became mentally impaired, kamala was born that way.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She was born that way.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"According to 538's average of polls, Harris is up by about 2.4 points in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The latest New York Times, the college poll, has her up by just one.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If that holds, or even if it's a little less but still an error of, let's say, three points, Donald Trump is going to win these states.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so she's not up by enough, again, if it's the same as now, if the polls are exactly dead on perfectly, they figured out all the kinks and what they're telling you is real, real close to the final, then yeah, she is going to win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But you can understand where the nervousness comes from, showing her in her must win states just up a little bit.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But his undercounted by about seven points, anything of even vaguely that scale is going to see him be the next president.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala has tried to reassure this aspect of the base.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I don't know how well she's done at that, because she really hasn't signaled any policy differences whatsoever from Biden.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Circling back to something we also mentioned in the introduction, what did you think about Trump blasting her purported mental capacities: yeah, I mean, that's not a kind thing to say.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I would not describe one's differences with Kamala Harris, and I have many, in that she's â€“ I don't think she's mentally unfit.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think she is not the clearest communicator ever.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't think she's a mental fitness.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"She said, for instance â€“ and this is not the biggest, most partisan scoring point ever, but she said that there were no U.S. soldiers involved in combat zones or in harm's way that is simply not true.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I worry that it's not this principled idea that it is up to Kamala Harris to fact-check Donald Trump and vice versa.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Donald Trump said that he's going to vote against reproductive rights protections in Florida.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Is that enough to protect women's access to abortion care in your state: not if Donald Trump is reelected and certainly not if he also has Congress to support him.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"We know that part of Project 2025, which is the playbook for Donald Trump and the Republicans, is a national abortion ban.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"We know all of that is going to be gone and out the window and states like mine, you know, will be helpless in the face of another Donald Trump presidency.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And yet those advantages aren't translating to a big lead in a contest against Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Who has a leadership experience needed for the job: donald Trump has the edge.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"That suggests that people see either his policy choices, say on abortion, as out of the mainstream, or his general style and approach, his persona, as too extreme.",Donald Trump,Michigan
There were two assassination attempts on Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Across these seven states, we find that Donald Trump is holding 93 percent of Republican voters and Kamala Harris is holding 93 percent of Democratic voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
What's important though is how much ground Kamala Harris has made up.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's gained in Arizona, in North Carolina, in Georgia.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
This means that she has more roots to victory in the Electoral College than Joe Biden did.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's competitive in all seven states, including these Sunbelt states, that look to be slipping out of reach for the Democratic Party.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Hello everyone, Harry here to talk about revelation of a phone call that includes an audio tape of Trump pressuring two county canvassers from Wayne County where Detroit is located not to do their legal duty under state law and certify the vote in favor of Biden.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So Trump's allegations about hanky-panky were on their face already dubious.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And it's just a vintage, brow-beating Trump call totally of a piece with the recorded call l'or-de-glorÃ©.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Thank God there are tapes that Trump makes to Brad Raffensperger in Georgia some weeks later.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And Trump says, yes, we'll take care of that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And Trump himself, not to mention McDaniel, plainly offered an attorney to represent them clearly something of value.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"As Errol Burnett explains, the judge found Trump guilty of violating his gag order.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump has since removed the social media and campaign website posts the judge found violated the gag order.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump has denied both allegations.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Jurors saw text between him and former National Enquirer editor, Dylan Howard.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I have a blockbuster Trump story, Davidson wrote June 7th, 2016.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know why, judge Murchin also announced there will be no court May 17th so Trump can attend his son's graduation.",Donald Trump,Michigan

"Errol Barnett, CBS News, New York, and Trump is scheduled to stop at MBS Airport in Freeland in Saginaw County tomorrow at 6 p.m. A CBS poll shedding light on what voters think in the battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When asked about the economy, 62 percent of voters say that the economy was better during the Trump presidency.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So Beverly, your thoughts on those voters in that poll, saying that it was better with President Trump in office: well, again, I can respect people who participate in the polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But I would say this consistently in those battleground states referenced in the Emerson poll, Trump has had a lead in just about every poll that's come out this year in those battleground states.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He was always trailing and only narrowly lost, and so, you know, I think Trump voters are notoriously hard to poll and get their participation so that you can get an accurate reading.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So unfortunately for Democrats, I think having polls with Trump with a narrow lead probably means he has a slightly larger lead than what's reflected in that polling.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Are you concerned about the downstream effects of this on the candidate Trump and the potential president Trump: i don't really see Trump's problems being problems for Republican candidates for other office.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And for those that don't like Trump, it will confirm what they already believe.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But Trump has been defying gravity politically and poll in polling since he came down the escalator eight years ago.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So I don't think that that his travails are necessarily going to affect other Republicans for Senate, for Congress, state legislature, governor, et cetera.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The economy was not bad when Donald Trump was president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Once upon a time I was for Trump, but he's just gotten out of control.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The God who is my team and that tool protected Donald Trump because he â€” When Pastor Lorenzo Sewell gave his electrifying speech at the Republican National Convention this summer.,Donald Trump,Michigan
President Trump came to a church that is in a Democratic stronghold.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He wasn't just speaking to the party faithful in Milwaukee.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He came to a church to listen to average, everyday Americans like you and like me.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He was also sending a message to his home city of Detroit.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Simply put, Donald Trump is the best choice for African-Americans.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"After all, Trump came to Sewell's church in the city's west side, what the pastor describes as the hood.",Donald Trump,Michigan
People have been inundated with false truths that he's a threat to democracy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But he came to this church.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And when President Donald Trump came to the church, he did what no Republican has ever done since I was born.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So if you travel around this community and you ask people â€” I mean, with all due respect, he initiated a â€” like, I'm not â€” yeah, he initiated and kind of essentially cosigned a â€” I won't call it a coup because that gives it too much credit, but like a, you know, push attempt against the government.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So because he showed up to a church, a predominantly black church, I don't think that changes that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So could Donald Trump actually be on the verge of a major breakthrough: like so much else in politics ahead of election day, it depends on who you ask.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Once upon a time, I was for Trump, but he's just gotten out of control.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It's just not the things that he said doesn't add up.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's right about that, i can't fault him for that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The idea that the economy was better under Trump than Biden, it depends on what you're using as a measure of success.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"For Canadians, it might, that political reporter Ken Coleman points out Trump isn't trying to win over the majority of black Michigan residents.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He only needs a few, donald Trump in 2016 won Michigan by 10,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so I think the strategy is, as I talk to Trump supporters, even some of whom are African American, they know that most African Americans aren't going to vote for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He can sway five or 10,000 maybe in Detroit proper and Flint and Battle Creek, other urban areas, maybe five or 10,000 in each one of those cities.",Donald Trump,Michigan
April Anderson is a Harris loyalist.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Why: again, they're young African Americans and they believe that Trump gave them money during the pandemic.",Donald Trump,Michigan
They believe that and they believe that when he gets back in office he's going to do it again.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris may have another problem.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Despite the warm reception during her visits to Michigan, she could be facing an obstacle no campaign stop can overcome.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If they don't vote at all, that lack of turnout could...",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is the story of one of them, the Arab Americans who will vote for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So I think it's just a safer bet to go for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Kassan Shahab is a pillar of this place, Palestinian by birth, American now to the core, and Trump is his man.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think Trump is not a politician.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He is just a regular person.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It happens that he's a billionaire or a millionaire, whatever it is.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But he has morals.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"In his last presidency, many would see him as trampling on Palestinian rights, on aspirations.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He moved the Israeli embassy to Jerusalem.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He hasn't endorsed an arms embargo.,Donald Trump,Michigan

No one from Team Harris has reached out to you.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But do you not think that Donald Trump just sees you as a number in his pocket: donald Trump, listen, I requested if he wants our support, I want to meet him personally.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And he came, and he listened to me.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"More progressive, yes, and yet coffee with local political activist Samra Luchman should alarm the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"None, my children, I came home the day I met Trump and I gave my son a MAGA hat.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And on the other hand, you have Kamala and all these promises she's making.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Like, she hasn't... She had time to do them.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I don't think she's going to.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris aims to win their hearts by emphasizing her administration's actions, like extending legal status to Lebanese citizens.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But Trump isn't backing down, he's softening his past rhetoric and even got an endorsement from the Trump Democratic mayor.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris is doubling down on her support for the community, while Trump's strategy is to leverage dissatisfaction with the current administration by it's a high stakes game where every vote counts.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Pennsylvania, he's ahead.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He won Michigan and Pennsylvania against Hillary Clinton in 2016 despite being far behind.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Trump wins Pennsylvania and Michigan, it's game over for Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
She was here in Arizona last week trying to rescue their efforts in this state.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It had looked very close, but polls moving away from her and towards Donald Trump, which is fascinating because this is a state that's going to elect a Democrat to their vacant Senate position and also vote to enshrine abortion rights in their Constitution, although with limits, a move that is annoying people on the extremes of both sides on that issue.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If Trump wins, it will be due to the economy.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So when Trump says he's going to look out for workers, he's going to bring in tariffs, that may not please the economic club, but it's pleasing voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That same Republican Senate candidate who awkwardly appeared with Trump this weekend, Carrie Lake, she released secretly recorded audio tapes of the Arizona state Republican chairman in which she said he was trying to bribe her to leave the Senate race.",Donald Trump,Michigan

She's lived a life like ours.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She knows us.,Kamala Harris,Michigan

"Arizona Marist poll has got Trump up a point, and North Carolina, they've got Trump up two points.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Go ahead, Tom, yeah, I mean, this race, Kamala Harris had a two-point lead in our RCP two-way national average just a couple of weeks ago, but as you mentioned, the Wall Street Journal poll came out last night.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"CNBC came out this morning with Trump up two, and so that lead has shrunk now to the point where he, if the trend continues, he'll move ahead in our national average sometime in the next 24 hours if we get another poll that sort of confirms that he's got some forward momentum.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"My gut says Donald Trump, and my guess is that it is true for many anxious Democrats, but a 50-50 forecast really does mean 50-50, and you should be open to the possibility that those forecasts are wrong, and that could be the case equally in the direction of Mr. Trump and Ms. Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I will say, obviously, the polls did undercount Trump in 2016.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It looks like Trump's gotten a little bit of separation in Georgia and a little bit of separation in Arizona, but Harris' most likely path is still through Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump, 2024, is repeating what he did in 2016, blanketing and blitzing these swing states, as is Jay DeVance, who's been to Pennsylvania 19 times since he became the vice presidential nominee, and Kamala Harris is doing what Hillary Clinton did.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It has Donald Trump up one point among likely voters 50-49.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Your average, real clear, has Trump leading by half a point.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And this is kind of how that went down, let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist: yes, I do.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Go online to listen to John Kelly, the former chief of staff of Donald Trump, who has told us, Donald Trump said, why essentially why aren't my generals like those of Hitler's: there's a whole lot there in that sound by Jim Messina from the left, my right, Karl Rove to the left, from the right, my left.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In two instances out of that 21, the lead for, in this case, Donald Trump is two points or better.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump, what he's doing at these rallies is he gets to this point where he gets like a minute and a half where he says, this is what I'm going to do.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And everything he says is a headline on a policy that he would support.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And obviously the emphasis on being optimistic is important, but he keeps stepping on this.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is the most disciplined campaign his staff has run, but he remains undisciplined.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And in the next 12 days, you need to have him saying that kind of thing with a little bit more depth and substance to it and less on the sort of the riffing that has caused people to, if he says something sort of wild, the media is going to cover the wild thing rather than the substantive thing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Real Clear Politics reports Trump now leads Kamala Harris by 0.5 percent, marking the first time he's ahead in Michigan since July.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If these results hold, Trump is predicted to win the election with 296 electoral college votes to Harris' 242.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Polls from Quinnipiac and other sources show Trump gaining ground, while other aggregators still place Harris slightly ahead.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If the consequences is Trump presidency, so be it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Kamala Harris has won some support from the community, including an endorsement from MGAG.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But if a protest vote swells at the polls, it could cost her big.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump is seizing that opportunity by actively courting a community he once pushed away.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's having some success.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And in order to ensure a Harris loss, the best possible strategy would be to vote for the opposition, no matter who it might be.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"More than backing a winning candidate, she wants her community's strength in numbers to show their voting to end the war.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Both Vice President Harris and President Trump are polling at 49% just based on conversations you're having on the ground.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But President Trump always tends to perform better than any polling that's been done in either in either of the past presidential campaigns that he's been a part of, even if he does half of the overperformance that he's done in the past, it would be enough to obviously overcome a dead heat tie that the polling is showing right now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I've also seen other polling that has President Trump with the small lead, some that shows the vice president with a small lead.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"While Trump speaks in Michigan, as we mentioned earlier, the vice president is in the key Midwestern battleground state of Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That is until 2016, of course, when Donald Trump won and turned some of those blue states red for the first time since the 1980s.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Effectively, that's the win, assuming all else, but if Donald Trump were to win those three states, his path gets a lot easier because then all he has to do, for example, is win North Carolina, which he did, which he did last time.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And then he goes over 270, and that's just one example.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Reading now from the Politico piece, quote, a Trump advisor told Shade Room producers that Trump was, quote, exhausted and refusing some interviews, but that could change, end quote, at any time, according to two people familiar with the conversations.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When asked about it by Politico, the Trump campaign called the story, quote, unequivocally falls, as for the vice president who has talked to The Shade Room.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"First CNN's Priscilla Alvarez at the Harris event in the Detroit suburbs, what else has Harris said about former President Trump today: well, Anderson, we're expecting the vice president only minutes from now.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I mean, a month ago, Kamala Harris was up by two points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's up by less than a point.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
The chance that Kamala Harris wins if she wins Michigan is north of 80%.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
The chance that Donald Trump wins the election if he wins in Michigan is north of 90%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"The bottom line is Donald Trump knows that if he can go into Michigan, win a state he won in 2016, that Joe Biden won in 2020, Kamala Harris's path to 270 electoral votes is awfully, awfully difficult.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Jamal, you heard Vice President Harris once again declining to say what she would have done differently from President Biden.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
This is the third sort of publicly time that she's been asked that question.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Is her answer the right one at this point: you know what, I think it is the right one because the attack on Kamala Harris right now is about comparing past statements to current statements.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What does she believe: if she changes something about what happened with the president, the former, the current I imagine the Republicans will then attack her about that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So the idea here, I believe, is that this is about loyalty and it's better for her to be loyal even if they think it might cost her a little something in the beginning, it doesn't open up another line of attack.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Here's what she's doing that's very good though in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's going after Donald Trump.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's on the front foot.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's going after him for being exhausted.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's going after him for not showing up.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's traveling around the state.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She started out over here in Grand Rapids.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She went here to Lansing and now she's here in Detroit, right: she's been moving across the state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's now doing two or three events a day and that I think is also going to compel the attention to the campaign that she needs.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Meredith, it's interesting, on Jamal's point, you know, previously she just wouldn't answer of what made her different from Joe Biden initially and it seemed like that meant there was no difference.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now she's saying, well, this is a loyalty thing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And so she is trying to convince voters that, yeah, I'm the vice president and yet I do have all of these policy differences with Biden.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Also, let's just see what if the first person Trump is speaking.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"We'll come back just very quickly, in the Harris campaign analysis, this is about a change from Donald Trump, not Joe Biden.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Scott, we mentioned the reporting that a Trump adviser told the Shade Room that Trump was quote exhausted and backed out of an interview, which Harris already seized on.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The Trump campaign is denying it.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, is that a mistake for him to skip out on multiple interviews with just a little more than two weeks to go: or, you know, I mean, it's not a it's a site that's on Instagram.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I mean, Trump's done more media interviews and he's done more events than Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Number one, number two, Kamala Harris herself didn't show up for the Chicago Economic Club.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She bailed out on time.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump looks pretty vigorous to me.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He went to the Al Smith dinner last night and did 30 minutes of stand up.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris sent in another cringy video.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think Trump is in fine shape and he's doing plenty of events and media opportunities right now far more than Harris has done.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't really think he needs to lard up the schedule of his campaign.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump is up 12 with men.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump's got a four-point edge with men in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris has a three-point edge with women.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So a little bit underperformance there in this poll, but much more dramatically in Pennsylvania, harris's lead with African-Americans among likely African-American voters in Pennsylvania in our poll is 55 percentage points over Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That is a potential warning sign in places like Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, for the Harris campaign to take a look at.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And then interestingly, this is Donald Trump's base, Dan, as you know, white, non-college educated voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So interesting, and what about what voters are saying regarding Harris and Trump and which candidate they think gets them: yeah, I think it's such a good question.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
But clearly Harris's best mark across all three of these battleground states is that voters see her far more as honest and trustworthy than they do Donald Trump.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think these two categories were the point of her closing argument speech last night on the ellipse.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And those categories are working for her, obviously she'd like to see them be even bigger advantages across these three states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And this is Trump's big advantage right now as a characteristic.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He has an edge against Harris among likely voters in all three of these states.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris clearly wants to do some work on this score as well.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You could tell the work that Kamala Harris needed to do last night, arguing that she's the candidate for change, arguing that she would restore sort of normalcy and decorum and unity in the White House.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And you saw her make that implicit comparison.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There she was at the ellipse where Donald Trump, of course, invoked his mob to attack the Capitol and her essentially saying she's going to restore American traditions around inclusivity and around democracy's strong speech with an eye towards particularly undecided voters in those swing states, which are a sliver about 5% at this point.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Yeah, listen, and that is the great hope of Democrats, the great hope of Kamala Harris's campaign that these blue wall states were essentially revert to form, right: you saw Donald Trump win miraculously in all three of those states in 2016.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"For the vice president now on the nuclear politics average, giving Kamala Harris the lead for the first time in quite a bit in this battleground state at a time where we're in the final stretch of the campaign season, the Kamala Harris arguably really does need it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And now the 538 average also has moved back in favor of Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Because it means that Donald Trump's chance at victory is limited by the states at which he can win, right: when you're looking at Pennsylvania he can win Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And looking at the top line data, just really much what we're getting from this point, is that Kamala Harris is doing well amongst independents and Democrats at large.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And should she end up coming to a point where she needs to win a battleground state, if Michigan isn't there, they need to sub that out for a state like Georgia or a state like North Carolina.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And so seeing that compared to a five point lead for Kamala Harris, it does go to show that even the pollsters that do underestimate Democratic support or Republican support really can show very varying results.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now, the 2024 numbers of Trump versus Biden look very differently than they do for Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But across the rest, Detroit Free Press says that Donald Trump leads by seven.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trafalgar said Trump leads by two.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Emerson said Trump led by three.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Right, the Times, M.R.G., Remington Research, all of them said Donald Trump took the advantage.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Some firms say Kamala Harris leads.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Some firms say Donald Trump leads.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And when you take a look at the 538 forecast, which gives Donald Trump the upper hand on the presidential forecast, 53 to 46.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But again, the signs are pointing to a potential Kamala Harris victory in that state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
That would make a difference on the Electoral College because the math year again gets trickier for Donald Trump should Kamala Harris win any of these battleground states.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Should even she win Nevada, it becomes tricky in that Donald Trump at most would have a repeat in the 2016 election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If she wins Michigan by 5, she wins the election, right: which is why we're probably not going to see her win by 5.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It would mean that she would likely expand on that of Joe Biden's margin in 2020, which I just don't see happening at this point in time.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But it is entirely possible that she wins the election with just 270 electoral votes relying on Wisconsin, relying on Michigan, relying on Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think the Harris campaign announced a surprise rally in Georgia on Saturday.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Obviously could reach 270, could do even more than 270, but I think 241 is the lowest point for Kamala Harris, whereas Donald Trump's lowest point is roughly 219.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Do I think that Donald Trump could win it today: the answer is yes.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Does she have the upper hand, the answer is yes, right: so, Michigan is right now in a position where it could be and likely is becoming the more reliable state for Kamala Harris based on the data points, based on what we've seen thus far.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
He thinks that the value of your work is essentially meaningless.,Donald Trump,Michigan
That's what he's saying to compare it to child's work.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump also went after the vote of auto workers in Detroit on Friday.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He continued his pitch for increased tariffs on auto production outside of the U.S. And for those who don't make their product in America, they will be forced to pay tariffs, and we will take in hundreds of billions of dollars toward our budget.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Some Michigan voters have been hesitant with the Biden administration's response to the Israel-Hamas war, and Trump is honing in on that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump visited Hamtramik, a Detroit suburb, and got an endorsement from their Yemen board mayor, Amer Ghalet.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump wasn't the nicest to Detroit a couple weeks ago.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Statements like that, not going to help out Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But, you know, Trump has his own strategies and they've worked for him before.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But let's talk a little bit more about the Senate race.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"We can see that Slotkin is doing decently well in the polls, maybe even a little bit better than Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Is that a warning to Vice President Harris: it could be.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And it's about how President Harris is going to able to overcome this.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now you just heard the governor acknowledged the problem on immigration for the Harris campaign, but accused Republicans of being more interested in exploiting the problem than solving it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Remember, the Biden-Harris administration undid all of the border policies that kept our nation safe.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Stop trying to mix the two, oK, so recently, former President Trump's longest serving chief of staff, General John Kelly, revealed new allegations, including that as President Trump praised Adolf Hitler, he's one of a long list of former Trump aides, including his vice president, who say that Trump is too dangerous to return to power.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Somebody else who wants Donald Trump to lose the election is former Republican congressman Fred Upton, who represented a district near yours for many years.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But if these voters are principally concerned about Harris and what they see as her unwavering support for Israel, how do you make an argument to them that they would be better off in that regard with Donald Trump as president: all you have to do is look at the facts.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Unfortunately, President Vice President Harris talks about what she's going to do, what she's going to do.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
The problem is she's had she's been in office for almost four years.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And what has she done under President Trump: his actions speak louder than his words under President Trump.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And I can share with you he has got a tremendous support from the Muslim community.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Are you a previous Trump supporter: the first year he won in 2016, I was not.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Oh, absolutely, small business owner Andrew Cingrati backs Trump, too.",Donald Trump,Michigan
How will you feel if Trump doesn't win: i am.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump seized on it as an example of widespread election fraud.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"When Donald Trump on January 6th mentioned Antrim County, it was horrifying.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Cheryl, who had always worked in obscurity and a lifelong Republican, was suddenly called out as an enemy of Trump supporters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The systemic voter fraud that Donald Trump talks about doesn't exist.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"On election night in 2020, in Detroit, hundreds of people believed the election was being stolen from Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Only 33 percent of Michiganders believe Donald Trump deserves to be returned to office.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump is going to get the number he gets.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"No matter what election he runs in, he seems to get a similar percentage in number.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"One for Harris, when Kamala Harris became the nominee for president, we as democrats, his folks with progressive values were able to switch from defense to offense.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Which I still feel in many ways, because it showed there's no bottom to how far Trump and his supporters were willing to stoop to overturn or discredit a legitimate election.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, on top of this as well, we all know Trump is endorsing people that are going to continue to push his big lie and continue to say the things we've stolen from him and hopefully replace people like the Secretary of State in Michigan that can certify the reality of these elections.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So he's endorsed this woman.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He'll instantly endorse you.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And by the way, he's Donald Trump's vice president.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And he portrayed him as a traitor.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And then he threatens her.,Donald Trump,Michigan
People like Donald Trump are running around committing acts of terrorism and violence and they're doing so in increasingly organized ways.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"They're forming mobs outside of people's house where they're armed, right, and then the point where you're like if you're outside somebody's house and you're just having a picnic and you're protesting, right, it's a little bit different if you bring a gun, isn't it, right: it's a little bit different if you're bringing a gun.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Remember, every time Donald Trump talked about the country, the people, the military, the voting, anything.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And he said, they're turning against America, substitute American for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's who he was talking about, and that's why this entire, now, again, also his talk about election fraud and how we need to do something about it separately.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So I think I don't want to take up arms against my fellow American, but I think I might have to.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, Trump didn't physically say that, but his rioters definitely said it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I'm glad to be working with you and other Michigan Republicans to send Kamala Harris to the White House this November.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"In fact, more than 30 former retired members of Republicans have now endorsed the election of Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, I was in Congress when Trump got elected for the first time in 26, the only time.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But with Trump, it became so much more difficult to find compromise across the aisle and solve problems for our constituents.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump has said that his actions on that day, jeopardizing the peaceful transfer of power, were totally appropriate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"His words, totally appropriate, and he's been so in doubt for months about the integrity of this upcoming election.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If he loses, he'll spread another big lie.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump does none of that.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Instead of focusing on making people's lives better, Trump is leveling personal attacks, spreading more election lies, and engaging in some of the most unstable and unhinged behavior that we've ever seen from a presidential candidate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Time and time again, he's shown that he's completely unfit to serve as commander in chief.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So today, I'm joining more than 30 former Republican members of Congress who publicly refused to support Donald Trump, and am proud to say that I've already cast my ballot for Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But I know that Harris has the best interests of the American people at heart, and I know that she embodies that kind of leadership that we need in the Oval Office to get things done.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Year after year, globalist politicians like Kamala Harris sold you out and let other countries loot and pillage and plunder your wealth.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Vice president Kamala Harris is on the other side of the state pressing her message that reproductive rights are at stake in the election.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
The physicians that I've been talking with are concerned about this myriad of issues that have highlighted the fact that because of Trump and what he did with the Supreme Court we are looking at a health care crisis in America.,Donald Trump,Michigan
She needs to do really well in these university towns in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti and Mount Pleasant and of course East Lansing as well because this is where she's gonna need to run the score up to counter some of Trump's advantages in working-class cities in the state.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"This is you know, his strategy has definitely turned towards trying to mirror the Democrats strategy in previous elections to try to bank as many early votes between absentee votes by mail and also early in-person voting.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This shift to electric vehicles, how's each campaign dealing with that issue: we Donald Trump has honed in on this subject very with very tight specific issues going after EVs, essentially saying to people your big three automakers should not be trying to compete with China.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean he went into Flint, Vehicle City, the birthplace of General Motors and made this message about a month ago.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's continued to talk about it and really rail against electric vehicles and come what he is trying to basically counter and say hey look we want to compete with China.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now that Harris is in the race, how has that community approached her, what are they thinking about Harris: that unhappiness has not eased and it has maybe even grown more frustrated as the war in Gaza has dragged on and now Israel has been bombing in Lebanon.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Democrats are trying to use this as an issue to say, hey look, if you elect Tom Barrett or Donald Trump, this plant, this Cadillac plant is in serious danger of closing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"With just 10 days left before election day, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in the key battleground state of Michigan on Saturday.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Believe me, if Donald Trump is president again at some point or another, that ugliness will touch all of our lives.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris repeated her warnings on the dangers of the Trump presidency, a big part of her message in the final days of the campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails, he who will claim unchecked and extreme power if he is re-elected.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He who has vowed he will be a dictator on day one.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He who has said he wished he had generals like Hitler's.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump was in Novi on the outskirts of Detroit.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He didn't appear alone, some of the state's Muslim leaders took the stage to say this.",Donald Trump,Michigan
We as Muslims stand with President Trump because he promises peace.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He promises peace, not war.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It was a scene that would have been improbable during Trump's presidency when he enacted a ban blocking immigrants from seven majority Muslim nations.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump is basking in it.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And this time around the polls show Kamala Harris and Donald Trump neck and neck.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And Trump said he wanted to send our jobs out of Michigan for a lower paying wage, so we get desperate and beg for our jobs back.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump believes that my family doesn't deserve a livable wage.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Kamala Harris has a history of fighting for the American worker.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris is looking out for us.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I'm Kamala Harris and I approve this message.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"One thing we must acknowledge is that if you look at the polls today, it seems as though Kamala Harris's convention bump has peaked.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And all I was doing was communicating what was going on, and likewise, we saw a reversal in the polling in Kamala Harris's favor going from losing the national polling to winning by a fraction of a point to winning by a point to winning by a point and a half to winning by almost two points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Donald Trump has gained back half a point.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And we have seen a reversal where Kamala Harris is polling seems to be coming back down.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Donald Trump's is going up concurrently.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Nate Silver's forecast gives Trump the top odds of winning in November that he has had since Kamala Harris became the presumptive nominee.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"That would be a change from 2020, a state that Trump lost then that he is potentially on track to win right now in Nevada, where Biden won.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris is holding a lead, but it's half a point.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"A couple that say Trump are winning, one that says Harris is winning, although it appears to be an outlier.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump has a lead.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Nevada were to go Trump, that means that Donald Trump wins.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Michigan were to go Trump, that means that Donald Trump wins.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, of course, there is still very much a possibility that Harris carries Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris has got this.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Right, the scenario is whatever the momentum felt like in those first 10 days of Kamala Harris, you've got to forget about that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's backed off of that lead by about half a point.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"For example, in 2020, surveys understated Trump by precisely 2.3%, whereas Biden won by only 0.3% despite having a 2.6% advantage in the polling average heading into election day.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump's lead would thus grow to 3.4% by incorporating the weighted polling error average of R plus 2.3 into the current real clear polling average, which includes 1.1% to 2.3 of the average polling error.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In comparison to Biden's nearly 14-point victory in 2020, Harris leads by 11 points, which is relatively underperformance.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Adding well 1.8% to Harris' margin produces a Harris plus 12.8 final outcome, which is more than enough to place Colorado in the safe blue column on our map.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"According to the average of the latest six surveys, Trump currently leads Harris by 6.0%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump's large lead here is unsurprising given Florida's recent election cycles significant rightward tilt.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Nevertheless, Trump won by 3.4%, the largest margin for a presidential candidate in Florida since 2004.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Adjusting for previous polling error, Trump's current six-point lead over Harris in the real clear average rises to 8.5%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump underperformed in several other states but he was only underrated in Georgia by a point.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Making that small modification to the current polling average increases Trump's lead from 0.5% to 1%, keeping Georgia's tilt.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Without current polls based on Trump's 20 margin of plus 8, Iowa will be classified as most likely Republican, with an average error of 4.6%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"For what it's worth, this includes 6 to 7 point underestimations of Trump in both 2016 and 2020, strengthening its likely Republican status on our map.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris leads by 11.6% over Biden's 9 point victory in 2020.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But in 2024, Trump has recently led in the polling average by 0.9%, with 48.5%, to Harris's 47% according to the last 10 polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris is particularly concerned about this shift, as she has consistently led Trump by 1 to 2 points since becoming the Democratic nominee.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump's increase of 3.5% in 2016 and 5.0% in 2020 is very concerning.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Applying that 1.7% polling error to Trump's current margin increases his lead to 2.6%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Losing all three would undoubtedly throw Harris's path to 270 electoral votes off track, starting two states to the west.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Our next state is Minnesota, where real clear polling shows Harris leading her running mate Tim Walz's home state by 4.7% on average over the last four polls, ranging from Harris plus 3 to Harris plus 6 from 49% to 44.3% compared to Biden's 7-point margin four years ago.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Kamala Harris's advantage has shrunk to 2.7% with a 2-point shift in the poll average, which remains leaning Democratic.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If we adjust Trump's narrow advantage to reflect historical bias, the outcome becomes a small Harris lead of 0.4%, which is still inside the margin of error.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris leads Trump by 7.4%, according to the most current average of actual clear polls, a slight increase over Biden's advantage in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Using that two-point swing to the current polling average, Harris's lead falls from 7.4% to 5.4%, converting New Hampshire from likely Democrat to lean Democrat on our map.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris's lead has increased from 8 to 9.3 points.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump leads in 7, Harris leads in 1, and 3 are tied.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Although all of these polls have a margin of error, the only one that shows Harris ahead is from less reliable pollster Atlas info which examines prior polling failures.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Historical polling mistake, Trump's lead has risen from 0.5% to precisely 3%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"According to real clear polling, Trump leads by 7.4%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Fascinatingly, Trump has led by exactly 6 points in each of the last 3 surveys, implying a modest underperformance compared to his 8-point victory margins in 2016 and 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump's lead grows from 7.4% to 12%, shifting Ohio from probable Republican to safe Republican.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"According to real clear polling, Trump is now leading by 0.3% with 48.3% of the vote to Harris's 48%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump has led in 7 of the last 12 polls, establishing the first sustained advantage he has had in Pennsylvania in some time.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Hillary Clinton led by 4.1% in the polls before election day in 2016, but Trump won by 0.7%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"With this update, Trump's lead grows to 2.5%, defining Pennsylvania as a lean Republican.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Online, real clear polling shows Trump leading by 5.7%, nearly identical to his 5.6% victory in 2016, owing primarily to a 4.5-point underestimation of Trump in 2020, whereas 5.38 put Biden within one point.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump's lead in Texas expands to 7.6%, shifting our map from lean to likely Republican.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"With two states remaining, Trump surpasses the 270-vote threshold and receives 296 electoral votes, ensuring his win.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Let us now head to Virginia, where the most recent poll average shows Harris leading by roughly 6-5 points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Although Harris continues to underperform, the Commonwealth voted for Biden by 10 points in 2020, giving Democrats the largest margin they've had, all cycle memory.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"After controlling for weighted error, Harris' lead increases slightly from 6 over 4% to 6.5%, despite the very tiny polling flaws.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris, like Michigan and Pennsylvania, has led since late July.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's highest here, applying the 4.3-point adjustment to Trump's 4-point edge completely reverses Harris Slim's lead.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump would thus win the 2024 presidential election with 306 electoral votes to Kamala Harris' 232, based on the most recent polling averages in major battlegrounds around the country, adjusted by the average error in the previous four presidential elections.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, and you know, Stuart in a memo obtained by NBC News, the Harris campaign says its path to winning Michigan is through the suburbs with the aim of capitalizing on what it says is Trump's weakness among women and white college educated voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And after that, it shifted just enough to give Donald Trump this narrow, narrow victory, one with 46.1 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, I mean, I want to bring in NBC's Von Hilliard, who's covering the Trump campaign.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Von, maybe different way of describing how the Trump campaign has been going these last couple of weeks.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I think that's why we're seeing the conversation not necessarily shift from reproductive freedom to freedom writ large, but also shifting to just the threat that Donald Trump poses.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And you have another candidate from the other party who is trying to broaden the tent to the point where, and I'm talking about Vice President Harris, she has been, as much as she has been asking the Democratic base for their votes, she's also asking Republicans for their votes, where she's campaigning with Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and other Republicans to show that if they give her their votes, she is going to be a president for all Americans.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Von, meanwhile, who is Trump trying to reach with his activities today: he's actually going to be in Oakland County, Michigan, which is exactly where Vice President Harris is going to be holding in a rally later tonight.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that's why you see Donald Trump there this afternoon, as well as Vice President Harris, because they understand the significance of getting those suburban, independent, even reticent conservatives, one time Republicans, to vote for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But this is all coming at a point in time where, you know, you have a Trump campaign that may target an area, may have a certain message it wants to deliver on.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But Donald Trump, as he did this morning while on Fox and Friends, his message veers off course this morning, he suggested, for instance, that Abraham Lincoln was a great president, though he suggested that he should have settled the differences between the union and the Confederacy before the Civil War started.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, of course, there was no follow up question as exactly how he would do that, whether that would mean slavery would still have had to exist as part of this supposed settlement.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But for Donald Trump, he's just over two weeks out here and he has a slate of campaign events in North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan planned.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And if his faithful supporters get out there, it's going to be up to Vice President Harris to counter that by building a coalition that is able to win over those suburban voters in the likes of Oakland County, north of Detroit, but also in Detroit proper and make sure that that Democratic base continues to come out for her.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And the striking thing about this race is Donald Trump's inability to move consistently above 47 percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he won with 46.1 percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He lost with 46.9 percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So I really am more focused at that number than where Harris is, because Harris' favorable-unfavorable ratio is considerably better than Donald Trump's.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
President Trump earned his respect.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He earned the votes that he received in 2016.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He was a businessman, and the Black community knew him, but certainly by the ventures that he had as a businessman.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And so he has earned the respect, he has a record, for which we can be proud of.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"U.S. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, they both won the Michigan primaries.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Based on history, Trump's history, that is, he would be far worse for Gaza than President Biden.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So what did that tell you: president Trump really does have a high hill to climb.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I know there's some polling that shows that he's in the lead in some cases in a hypothetical match-up with President Biden, or very close.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But it's important for everybody to remember that he lost the general election by close to seven million votes, and it doesn't appear that he's done very much to find those votes anywhere.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But the reality is that it doesn't seem, at least at this point, in those battleground states that he lost, with the possible exception of Georgia, that he's closed the gap in any meaningful way.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In terms of vulnerabilities, the main one is that, at least at this point, he has not been able to convince people that he is better than Biden.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, you know, and I was just wondering when this, you know, this report out that the Harris campaign may be concerned about whether it can win Michigan or not.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I don't know if you could say that the Trump campaign has been, you know, clear on many issues, this not being one of them.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Obviously, to say that Donald Trump only won by 10,000 votes in 2016, and we just saw 101,000 people vote uncommitted.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So we also need to talk about Kamala Harris being a threat to our democracy and the Democratic Party being a threat to our democracy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's my main issue, do I want to stop Donald Trump from becoming president again, or do I want to, you know, vote my conscience and demonstrate also the power of the Arab American and Muslim vote: that feeling of uncertainty is present for Lexus in the uncommitted campaign as well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think a lot of people would be surprised to know that Kamala Harris right now is on track to do worse among union households than Hillary Clinton did in 2016.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
It's important to point out how terrible Trump's labor record was and is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump boasts how he didn't want to pay overtime.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He appointed an extremely right wing anti-labor secretary of labor.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I wonder, you talk about the contrast in these two tickets, right: all of the things Trump has said, Trump's record.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And then you have the filings from this month about who is supporting Trump's candidacy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Who is standing up and fighting for them: and I think Kamala has got to be strong.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Look, she's brought forth a number of very good ideas.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Housing crisis, she wants about three million units.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump is out there, he has his enemies.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, he is going after undocumented people.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Kamala does that, i think she's going to win a whole lot more working class people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump is ahead by 1.5% but it's still a toss-up.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris holds a 24-point lead in this Democratic stronghold.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump has 47.7% while Harris follows closely with 47.3%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Nevada in Nevada, Trump leads by 0.6% with 47.2% of the vote compared to Harris's 46.6%, a close race that could go either way.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"New Mexico, harris leads in New Mexico with 49% to Trump's 43% giving her a 6-point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"In New Hampshire, Harris leads in New Hampshire with 52.5% to Trump's 43.5% holding a 9-point lead in the Granite State.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"North Dakota, north Dakota is solidly in Trump's column with him leading by 27 points at 61% to Harris's 32%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"South Carolina, trump leads in South Carolina with 52% of the vote to Harris's 42% giving him a 10-point lead.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Alaska shows Trump leading by 9 points with 52% of the vote to Harris's 43%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"New York's in New York, harris leads by 13.5 points with 54.5% of the vote to Trump's 41%, colorado, colorado shows Harris leading by 11 points with 53% to Trump's 42%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Rhode Island, rhode Island shows Harris leading by 16.5 points with 57% to Trump's 40.5%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Oregon-Harris leads in Oregon by 11 points with 55% of the vote to Trump's 44% and there you have it.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
A comprehensive look at the polling data in the 2024 race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Dark Soul on the I am says a lot of guests on the show keep bringing up how there's some sort of issue legitimacy or otherwise with Harris not winning a primary but no one seems to ever clarify what this even means or why it actually matters other than verily vague aesthetic issues.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And you can see Trump leading in five of them with Harris leading in two.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I think the Harris campaign knows it as well.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris sitting around plus three, now, there have been a few more positive polls for Harris out of Nevada, although there was one big outlier that helped her average from Bloomberg, which I think is going to get the polls really wrong, especially underestimating Trump supporters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I really don't see that personally, i mean, if she's like one or point five, I could understand it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Again, the big surprise here out of all of these swing state polls, Trump has the biggest lead in Michigan, which you could argue based off of all the polling that we have.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He, you know, all the polling says he probably has the lowest percent chance to win Michigan out of any of these states because the Pennsylvania polling, it's also got him up by three points in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But it is a little bit surprising to see North Carolina Trump down two and a half.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And that's really how it is, if you look at the average in terms of how they've graded, at least in the Trump era, I'm saying in 2016 and 2020, just because of how badly ABC News and Quinnipiac and New York Times and you got how bad all of these pollsters have have have pulled Trump and his supporters.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You'll take that, especially considering how Trump's been polling.",Donald Trump,Michigan
There's no way Trump is winning Ohio by six points.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Even if Trump wins Ohio by six, it's not going to be that much of a difference to where Brown beats Moreno by four.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But Trump wins by six, it's not going to happen.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But there's no way Trump's winning by six.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I think Trump wins Ohio by around eight and a half to nine.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It's like Trump performing 11 points better.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So I think he wins by about nine or 10.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"If I were to predict this poll release, I would have said Trump probably have about two and a half to three in North Carolina and possibly down a few points in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In this case, Harris, 0.03 advantage in the average of the polls, also, Michigan, now, Wisconsin, Trump has a history of outperforming his polls, which is also important.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"When he had 307 electoral votes, he won all three of those.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But then you'd have to, he won Georgia as well, keep that blue.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"See, that's still only 258, so, in this scenario, Harris would have to run the table in all the other swing states, like North Carolina, right: just to get to where it was.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Doesn't mean he's going to win, but a little bit of movement here over the last month for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Mike Rogers, a former critic of Donald Trump, has now aligned with him in his Senate race against Democratic Rep. Alyssa Slotkin in Michigan, highlighting the influence Trump still holds over the Republican Party.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So for most of the summer, the race looked like this with Harris having the slight advantage in Wisconsin and Michigan, Trump ahead in Georgia, North Carolina, and Nevada and PA being right on the edge.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Taking a look at the polling, the gap is beginning to close across the board, but technically Harris still has a slight lead in these states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"For example, in 2016, Trump was down 3% in Pennsylvania, and he ended up winning the state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"6 Ray's here, and if you think President Trump's policies on the economy would be better for your family personally for sure A lot of my friends are obviously my age.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They're like, well, we were broke with Biden We weren't with Trump what's going on everybody: welcome back to the channel hope balls good wherever you are This is a hilarious video This is what happens when these leftist woke media people get out of their Leftist woke media a little bubble and go actually talk to real people.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah Okay, I'm seeing like only a handful who here knows what the Dobbs decision is One person, okay, that's super interesting What about abortion That you think I think it's the woman's right, yeah, nobody should be able to dictate that at all And what do you think of Trump's position on abortion: yeah, he wants to control that yeah As any business even talking about what about abortion Productive choice is that something that you guys think about is something that concerns you I think each side is a little too crazy They meet in the middle.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Nobody knows what that is She doesn't do interviews people want to know what's gonna happen because the price of gas and food Pick something everything is up 10 to 50 percent more than it was when Trump was in office That's what people want to know.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She was there This is one of the two elections in history that you have a track record of both people and the fact that a matter is Everything was better.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's not gonna get better for you.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Do you feel like Donald Trump's gonna be better on that issue: based on what we've seen on his first four years.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I do believe that he will be better on that Do you are you leaning towards Trump right now, yes, ma'am Is there anything that vice president Harris could do at this point to change your mind: not particularly no unless she changes her stance completely on fixing the border That's no this is your first election.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I'll be able to make a more educated Everybody's always talking about how the polls are so close right now I think some of these polls are manufactured because I don't see how it could be close maybe at the beginning when Kamala was first introduced and she was the Party of joy or the party of the vibe at the end of the day You need your dollars to go further for you for your family And like I said, even if you don't like Donald Trump He is the better option vote for where you want the country to be in five ten fifteen twenty years Hope you all enjoyed this video If you did smash that thumbs up button consider subscribing to the channel help it grow catch you all in the next video Peace out everybody",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"it's back up now, now that  harris is the candidate, to  about 43%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"didn't like trump, didn't like  hillary, and we ended up,  michigan in the trump category.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"and you can say to them, yeah,  but you know trump is going to  be a lot worse.",Donald Trump,Michigan
he wouldn't let us travel.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"let me ask you this, because  donald trump did a couple  stunts.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"his stunt pretending like he was working at mcdonald's, it was a  closed mcdonald's.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"then he goes to north carolina,  that was in pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"then he goes to north carolina  and he gets a french fry pin,  given to him by congressman who  before had to get rid of  disinformation that trump was  spreading about the hurricane,  and he was standing in front of  hurricane damage, getting this  pin.",Donald Trump,Michigan
he's insulting detroit workers  saying a child could do the work that autoworkers do.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"absolutely, and over the weekend, he told  the wives of michigan to get  your fat husbands off the couch.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"oh, he says america, america  is going to end up like detroit.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So Oakland County will be a suburban focus as well for former President Trump before he holds a rally tonight in the city of Detroit.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, by the way, Harris also has an event in Oakland County tonight.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But again, it was a Harris lead now a slight Trump lead in the polling average in the middle of all of this.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump's January 6th case is back in the spotlight today.,Donald Trump,Michigan
A federal judge has unsealed nearly nineteen hundred pages of evidence that Jack Smith is using to prosecute Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So again, the trend to Trump GOP 0.7 percent in the polls, but the win probability still in the column of Harris, the Democratic state, after all, is Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So when you talk about fundamentals of the state, Gretchen Whitmer, the governor, was at that event or is at that event with Harris state that normally goes for the Democrats.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"This is where Harris is speaking right now, now, suburban voters around the country in the last election went to Biden by a couple of points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
But Trump won the Michigan suburbs according to the exit polls.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Recent polling now shows Harris is up among suburban voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Macomb County was in focus for Harris's running mate Tim Walz just above Detroit there.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
These are the highly educated suburban voters that both campaigns covet and that the Harris campaign feels like it has an advantage in a state that has been trending toward Trump for some time.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
The other point that the Harris campaign has been focused on and the Trump campaign as well is the black vote.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So it's interesting that Trump goes to inner city Detroit today.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But Trump's polling advantage or since a polling advantage, his his better polling this time around, particularly with black men, is going to be something to watch in a in a place like this.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"For Harris, this surge in the polls is a promising sign that her campaign is resonating with voters in battleground regions.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"According to the latest polls, Harris holds a slight edge over Trump in both states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris's lead is particularly noteworthy, given that both Michigan and Pennsylvania were instrumental in Trump's 2016 victory and played a key role in Joe Biden's success in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Key factors behind Harris's lead, several factors are contributing to Harris's surge in these key swing states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"First, her emphasis on economic recovery and job creation has struck a chord with voters who are still feeling the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris has also prioritized issues like health care, education, and climate change, which resonates strongly with voters in these industrial regions.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Additionally, Harris's ability to mobilize minority voters, particularly African Americans and women, has played a pivotal role in her recent polling success.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris's message of unity, fairness, and progress contrasts with Trump's often polarizing rhetoric, providing a stark choice for voters in these states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris, on the other hand, will continue to highlight her record in the Biden administration and propose forward-looking policies to address the challenges facing American families.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"For Harris, maintaining her lead in Michigan and Pennsylvania could be the key to securing a Democratic victory and continuing the party's legacy in the White House.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And the latest polls suggest that Kamala Harris may be on the path to making history once again.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Let's go, if the election were held today, who would win the election: kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Who thinks Donald Trump would be better for the border: let's face it.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Who do y'all feel like is the best candidate to handle crime in America: kamala Harris absolutely would be the best.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Was it not Vice President Harris who supported what, defund the police: more black men voted for Donald Trump than any other Republican ever.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Why is that, what is leading toward more support for him versus any other Republican: my brother is a firm Donald Trump support.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I understand that, are you saying that the brothers that subscribe to Donald Trump, that feel like he would be better, have a slave mentality: many of us do still have a slavery mentality.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's not Kamala Harris, it's not Joe Biden, it's not Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I left with 50% of them are going to vote for Donald Trump, and 50% of them are going to be for Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"There are some undecided people in there as well, but the one consensus that you continue to hear is about the Trump economy, the Trump economy, the Trump economy.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The other thing you hear, at least for some of the people that are going to vote for Kamala Harris, is that they want to be a part of the history of the first black woman being a president.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I think what mattered the most to them, it sounds like keeping jobs in America and paying for groceries at the grocery store for prices to go down so they would have more money to feed their families.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The one guy said about Kamala Harris, I don't have enough information on her stance on immigration.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Let's get started, nevada Trump leads Harris by 1%, with 47% of the vote to Harris's 46%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"This is shaping up to be a close race, pennsylvania, in Pennsylvania Trump, leads by 1% with 49% of the vote, compared to Harris's 48%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Nebraska's 2nd District, Harris leads by 9% with 50% of the vote, compared to Trump's 41%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"This district will be an important one to watch, delaware, Harris leads by 20%, holding 56% of the vote, while Trump stands at 36%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"New York, Harris leads by 14%, with 54% of the vote, compared to Trump's 40%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Wisconsin, harris leads by 1%, with 48% of the vote, compared to Trump's 47%, another battleground that could go either way.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Connecticut, Harris leads by 16%, with 57% to Trump's 41%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"A Democratic stronghold, rhode Island, Harris leads by 17%, with 57% of the vote, compared to Trump's 40% Rhode Island stays blue.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"New Hampshire, Harris leads by 9% with 51% of the vote, compared to Trump's 43% New Hampshire is leaning Democratic.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"New Mexico, Harris holds a 6% lead with 49% of the vote, compared to Trump's 43%, New Mexico leans Democratic.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Maine's 1st District, harris leads by 27%, holding 61% of the vote, to Trump's 34%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If she came out and said that we would stop sending arms to Israel, I think that would make me feel a lot better about my vote.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Maybe he'll come and save if she doesn't change her position.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Indeed, absolutely, and what sort of Christmas will Mr. Trump be having then, Greg: because he's looking at 2024.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's gotten, I think there's 91 kind of charges against him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't know how many of these he can surmount or get rid of between now and November.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Probably not all of them, and that's the big question is what if he gets a conviction or a handful of convictions, what does that do in the general election: he's obviously helping him in the primaries.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I don't think a conviction will hurt him too much in the Republican primaries.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But as Tom pointed out, prior to the Mar-a-Lago raid, this is in the summer of 22, he was only up nine over DeSantis.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"After the raid, up 39, and then he faded again during when DeSantis had the great midterm election, re-election.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump faded, then the indictments came along and he went from being basically tied with Trump to being down 50 as he is now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So I think it really continues to help him.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's perfectly set up now for the primaries with these indictments, with the mugshot, with the raid on Mar-a-Lago.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now the question is what happens in the general, do people get tired of it: he's still kind of maxing out at 47, 48%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's on a good day, so the real issue is can anyone else beat him besides Biden: i don't think Biden can beat him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Nobody could say he was a kind of a soft leaning version of Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
In many respects he was more to the right of Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He certainly was what many would call the full package of Republicanism.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Absolutely, he's more conservative than Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's better at executing than Trump has ever been.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he has a real appeal to the populist wing of the party.,Donald Trump,Michigan
The problem is a lot of those voters are very loyal to President Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But he was doing really well, and again, looking at the indictments, it's completely correlated to the change in support from moving from DeSantis to Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And it's really nothing that he's done.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He hasn't really changed his views on anything.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He hasn't really changed his campaign style.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Whatever he's doing worked for him in Florida.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he won by 20 points in Florida a few months earlier.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's always had a ceiling on his support.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"There's always only about so far he can go, he's got a very passionate base, but he obviously puts off a lot of people.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But he's been gifted both in 2016 and it seems like in 2024 as well with dreadful opponents as Joe Biden now is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He's someone who barely knows what day it is.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he makes Trump look like a philosopher king by contrast.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I think that's the thing that's always really helped Trump is that the Democrat and the Democratic establishment have been so incredibly complacent about who they put up against him.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Of course, Donald Trump makes a cameo.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Indeed, and the funny thing is he really doesn't look any different.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I know him and Biden are similar ages.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And it's often said Trump's a little overweight.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But actually Trump looks pretty good, yeah, he's high energy.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Correct, he's still running on all charges.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think Trump is 78.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But he's different than Biden.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Who's going to be the next president: oh, Trump's coming back.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now Trump won Michigan back in 2016, but lost it narrowly to President Biden four years ago.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Vice President Kamala Harris is set to speak here in a short while, and you see the strategy that she's coming into today with focusing on this broader coalition that she's trying to build, including Republican lawmakers, Republicans in and of themselves.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Liz Cheney, the former Congresswoman from Wyoming, is gonna be here today, but she also, the Vice President, picked up an endorsement from the daughter of Gerald Ford, Michigan's only president.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump's visit to Grand Rapids marks many firsts.,Donald Trump,Michigan
His first time on the trail is a 2024 Republican presidential nominee.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"His first rally with running mate J.D. Vance and his first rally since the assassination attempt on his life, tonight we have team coverage of the event from both inside and outside of the arena.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump went after Democrats.,Donald Trump,Michigan
And he was very critical of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump's brand new running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, introduced the former president.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump endorsed Rogers earlier this year and many in the party have begun to coalescence around Rogers who served in the U.S. House for 14 years and chaired the House Intelligence Committee.,Donald Trump,Michigan
This is the messages that he shared and what people thought of them.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I've been to like four of his rallies and it's just so inspirational and so patriotic.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I loved his emphasis on Michigan, that we are the arsenal of democracy, or the leading manufacturer of automobiles is going to bring him back.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Do you think he's going to win the state of Michigan in the election: because we've been so close both times, it's hard to say.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I do believe that he'll get more votes than he did the last two times.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"I believe he's going to kill it, he's going to crush it, he's going to win it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's going to win Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump's next rally is Wednesday in North Carolina.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And as you can see, Donald Trump has been going up in the betting odds for the presidency.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And when we look at the betting odds map, and no, this is not a prediction, we can see that he is now favored to win the state of Michigan, the most liberal of the Rust Belt Trio.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This was a state that back in 2016, Trump barely wanted by 10,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now he has a sizable chance of winning the state of Michigan because recently, folks, the election has been a nail biter.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The polling has been spotty, trump has been leading in some of the polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He's been losing in some of the polls.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He will too, in Wisconsin, eventually he's gotten some good polling there too.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Just for reference, Clinton was up seven points, seven percent, and Trump won the state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So the fact that Trump is now leading in Michigan and of all the pollsters, look at Quinnipiac.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, that's a Trump versus Biden margin before he dropped out.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And if we look at this article, we see that Democrats are protesting and not just Democrats, but Muslim voters may protest and stay home or even vote for Trump in protest over Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This is huge, and as I said back in my debate video, yes, Harris came out and she made a blunder.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She said she's always supported Israel at the DNC.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She did not give the Palestinian Americans even a five minute slot at the DNC.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
So she's just been treating them like Clinton treated Wisconsin or like she treated the Rust Belt Trio States.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
That's how she's treating this voter group.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And that's going to come back to haunt her in the state of Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
These folks are not going to vote for Kamala Harris as she just came out and she said that she wouldn't have done anything different from Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So the fact that she's basically a Joe Biden 2.0 and you have Arab Americans, Muslim Americans coming out, protesting, this is not good in the state of Michigan with less than four weeks to go.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And there Harris only leads by half a percent.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Clinton was leading by six, trump won it by one.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"We know that if Trump wins Michigan, he's winning neighboring Wisconsin and he's definitely going to win Pennsylvania, which he holds a 0.2% lead at the time of this recording.",Donald Trump,Michigan
This is huge for Donald Trump and he needs to keep visiting Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He needs to keep the momentum because Democrats don't really believe they're going to win.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Dems with data are extremely bullish on Trump winning.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris may lose six swing states.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"We know that the polls don't mean everything, but Democrats behind closed doors are panicking at the fact that Harris is not a likable candidate and she is not like a Biden.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She doesn't have the Obama nostalgia.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She says she's not different from Biden at all.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And she did it to herself.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I don't feel bad for her at all because she has played both sides just like what Biden has done.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"With Donald Trump, he may support Israel, but you know what you're getting when you vote for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You know, he's not going to flip flop on the issue.",Donald Trump,Michigan
He is going to support Israel.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump is also doing very well with African American voters.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now Harris is winning them by about 70%, but even still, if Trump does 5% better than he did back in 2020, that's going to be huge.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"This is terrible news for Kamala Harris, and she's running out of time to make up the margin.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She is almost being locked out of getting 270 electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And you do have the Detroit area, which has dictated the state's electoral history a lot in the past, but now everything is up in the air and you could see Trump eke out a very narrow victory in the state of Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But without further ado, I wanted to share this news, because if we do some election math, we can see here that the states that Trump won back in 2020 gets him to 235 electoral votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Meanwhile, the states that Harris won back, excuse me, the states that Biden won back in 2020 get Harris up to 213.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
That puts him at 250 electoral votes.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump winning Michigan gives him so many options.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He could also win through Michigan, Georgia, and Nevada.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He doesn't even need Arizona, Wisconsin, or Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That gets him to 269, he doesn't even need Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, or Nevada.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And he's leading in Arizona and Georgia.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He doesn't even need Arizona.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That can stay in the Harris camp, in the Democrat camp.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
He's likely to win Nevada because of voter registration.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And at that point, he doesn't even need Georgia and Arizona where he's already leading.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Do you see how this opens up the map electorally: trump is becoming unstoppable, not only just because of Michigan, but because in general, Trump is leading across the board.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Donald Trump chose JD Vance because he believed he would be a good running mate for the future of the GOP, not just for the 2024 ticket.",Donald Trump,Michigan
That question also stands for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She was sort of thrown into this position, and I don't think that anyone necessarily thinks of her as the next great Democratic Party leader.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Yeah, without question, Nicole, a cornerstone of the Trump campaign strategy has been to expand their electorate and court voters that, frankly, Republicans haven't even bothered to pursue in recent years.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This week we've seen the former president hitting Vice President Kamala Harris over her support from Liz Cheney, who he's called a war hawk and has been touting even at his rally in North Carolina last night that he believes he's going to make significant gains in this demographic.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's in freefall with Arab and Muslim voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You go back to 2016, Donald Trump carried the state by about 10,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It's a mad dash until election day and both former President Trump and Vice President Harris are out on the campaign trail right now in key battleground states.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump is heading from Georgia to North Carolina.,Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris is in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Where do Harris and Trump stand in Michigan right now: yeah, I think there's good reason for Democrats to be concerned with what's going on in the Wolverine state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Look, if you look at the Democrat versus Trump margin in of course the great state of Michigan, what do we see in the polling average, we see Kamala Harris only up by a point, right: compare that to the 2020 result when Joe Biden won a course in Michigan by three.",Donald Trump,Michigan
The chance that Harris wins the election if she loses in Michigan is just 7%.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Look at this, kamala Harris won that vote by 15 points back in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris is ahead in union households, but that number, that lead for her is down to just six points, down to six points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris is right now showing the poorest showing for any Democrat.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You'd have to go all the way back since 1984 in the Reagan landslide when Mondale won union households by even less than right now at Harris is ahead by, but the bottom line is, yes, Harris is ahead among union households in Michigan, but that margin is considerably slimmer than what Joe Biden wants amongst them back in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
But I don't know if she's behind in everything.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Why is she ahead: you know, maybe I'm just too stupid and not sophisticated enough to figure this out.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
But I don't think she ought to quit.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think she ought to play through election day.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Well, no one's suggesting that she quit, but she does have challenges in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Well, I'll listen to the segment, it sounds like she should.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You think Trump's not worried about North Carolina, you think Trump's not worried about Wisconsin: i mean, but all I'm saying, Jake, there's a ironclad rule that every data point has to be interpreted in the most negative light for the Democrat.",Donald Trump,Michigan
How can Kamala Harris get the support of somebody who thinks that way: so let's back up.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump says, I'll let me be do whatever the hell he wants to do.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Harris and Biden are saying we need to get, we need to have a ceasefire, we need to sit down and do that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So then they ask these people that are protesting Biden, who's actually more favorably disposed to their point of view, and they said, well, we can't do anything about Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So I don't know why you would say, we're not gonna vote for the people that actually wanna try to effectuate a very difficult solution to the problem here as opposed to somebody says, I'm just whatever B.B. wants, I'm gonna give him.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
President Trump is just on it.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He knows exactly what he's talking about.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"We are about 36 hours away from the U.S. presidential debate, the first and probably only time Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will take the same state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"First, we are looking at a New York Times and Sienna poll, where for the first time in weeks, Trump is leading Harris nationally.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"While Harris has managed to turn around the polls since incumbent Joe Biden's exit, the numbers are still neck and neck.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The poll suggested that Harris was narrowly ahead in Wisconsin and Michigan and tied in five other swing states, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, as well as Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It is important to note that Donald Trump continues to defy all odds, despite his historic status as, quote, being a convicted criminal.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When it comes to the issues on the ballot, Trump is doing exceedingly well.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He takes surprise in economy and inflation, while Harris is leading in housing and cognitive skills.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The election is already chaotic, with 81-year-old Biden dropping out amid concerns over his age and cognitive abilities, Donald Trump narrowly surviving an assassination attempt, and growing fears that Donald Trump again might refuse to concede if he loses in November.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I think she really has an opportunity now to rebrand herself and introduce herself to the country in a new way.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
What do you think it is about her: we know that she's a powerhouse speaker.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She has a level of authenticity that you know you don't always see from politicians.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"For weeks, young people have been sharing memes across social media highlighting Harris's speeches and affectations.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"One Gen Z favorite, you think you just fell out of a coconut tree: a May 2023 speech in which Harris shared something her mother used to say.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She has been the Biden campaign's most effective messenger on the issue of abortion access and reproductive freedom.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris took aim at Trump's economic track record, especially on manufacturing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She's pushing a strong pro-union message, promising jobs for workers without college degrees.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump, on the other hand, promised to boost American auto manufacturing by slapping tariffs on imported vehicles.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's focusing on hamtramck, home to many Arab American voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris didn't ignore this group either.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She acknowledged their struggles with the Israel-Palestine conflict and emphasized diplomacy for peace.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump's appeal: he's targeting those dissatisfied with the current administration's foreign policy.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Today, Vice President Harris continues her push in Michigan with a get out the vote rally in Detroit.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
These Harris supporters told us they're doing their part.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump has taken an unusual tack in Michigan lately, dissing the state's largest city twice in the past 10 days.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"On Friday, Harris called that unhinged.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If he can't handle the rigors of the campaign trail, is he fit to do the job: trump pushed back right away.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Starting on Monday, Harris will be embarking on a series of moderated conversations with former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Carolina In North Carolina, Trump holds a narrow 1% lead with 49% of the vote compared to Harris' 48%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In North Carolina, Trump is leading with 48.4% while Harris trails closely with 48.2%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Arizona is a crucial battleground where Trump leads with 49% of the vote compared to Harris' 47%.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It's a tight race with Trump holding a 2% lead.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"California is a key state where Trump holds 49%, narrowly leading Harris who has 45%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump has a slim 3% advantage here.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Nebraska District 2 Harris is ahead in Nebraska's 2nd District with 50% while Trump is at 42%, giving Harris an 8% lead.",Donald Trump,Michigan

Trump leads by 10% in South Carolina with 52% of the vote compared to Harris's 42%.,Donald Trump,Michigan

"New Hampshire, Harris is ahead in New Hampshire with 52% of the vote while Trump holds 43%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Harris has a comfortable 9% lead.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Arkansas with 55% while Harris has 40%, giving Trump a 15% lead.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
But Donald Trump has been here multiple times.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But a Trump voter is a strong, motivated voter, a mega voter is.",Donald Trump,Michigan
One of the first things he did is to try to do a Muslim ban.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He talks about incarceration camps.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He talks about all of that, but we've got to make up those votes in other places, which is why it is so important that we turn out the votes and we just have to do it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But ladies and gentlemen, we've got another brand new update and Donald Trump has reached an absolute climax.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Look at this lead for Kamala Harris, you can see it down here.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Look at all of this blue, it's collapsed.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's completely collapsed, harris was up by two.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And even if she was up by two on election night in terms of the popular vote, I'd still feel confident about Trump, but it's not that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Now we're seeing Trump basically tie Harris in terms of the overall popular vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump plus two, you've got Forbes, Harris X. These are not Republican pollsters, trump sitting plus two.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Rasmussen, you can argue is more Republican, but they underestimated Trump in 2020 the compost with the Harris plus four to try and prompt her up.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And then Trump would be ahead in this, by the way, if the TIPP updated tomorrow with a Trump plus one Reuters, but you've got all of these Harvard Harris is going to probably be releasing a new poll.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You, I mean, USA today, Harris plus one Emerson Harris plus one, they've got all the States very, very close, but the big thing we're tracking right now real clear politics average.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's unheard of, i mean, look at this day in 2020, the last two Trump election cycles, Biden was up by eight, Biden was up by eight and Hillary was up by five and a half.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's not even a plus one plus three plus two plus two plus three, so these leads are looking very, very nice for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump can lose the popular vote by one point and still very easily probably have a 95% chance to win the election.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He can lose it by two points and probably still win three points.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Couple that with Atlas Intel, the most accurate pollster of 2020 and 2022 saying Trump is up by around three.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Their last three polls over the past three months, they've said Trump is up by three.",Donald Trump,Michigan
It's not working and you have the terrible Kamala Harris town hall last night.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's probably going to come back down and that's when Trump is probably going to take the lead in terms of the real car politics, overall average in terms of that you have the current Pennsylvania Democrat, male and lead is down to around 366,000 in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's total crap, trump is up in all the polls in Georgia, Morris over samples, liberals, remember their poll that they had Harris plus five.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So it is over a hundred percent, but yeah, Trump's got around an 18%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Trump, if there's a poll that's solid that comes out, that Trump's up by one or two in Virginia, this will move significantly.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now he's back up to 62, it ebbs and flows.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"That's fine, it's going to happen, um, but overall, Trump is still the overwhelming favorite in a lot of these States in Georgia, in North Carolina, Arizona, Trump at 71, Nevada, Trump, and now it's up at 63 Michigan and Wisconsin have kind of hovered.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"They've kind of gone back down a little bit, but Trump's still the slight favorite there.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But overall, man, I mean, you take a look at this, not these national numbers right now, Trump is on the verge of flipping.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Like whether Harris is up by point two or Trump's up by point two, it's not that it matters too much, but it's just a funny thing to see Trump flip this based off of how much he lost in terms of pretty much every poll in 2020, all the polls in 2016, compared to where we are now in 2024, they bring Harrison the fake charade.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris is very unlikable, now Vance is more like than walls because people think walls is, is, is just, he's the weirdo now walls.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Um, but right now I would, I will say Donald Trump is in an amazing spot and we saw really, you could say, well, Trump was leading Harris when Biden withdrew, but this was before Harris really started campaigning and finding her footing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When she found her footing, she went up by like 1.8, 1.9, and she maintained it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
They've had Harris plus one for a while.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I don't know what that's about, but they just haven't pulled recently.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"They had a Harris plus four, but either way, again, these numbers look amazing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, you go back to the summer solid six point lead, even when Trump was doing way better than by doing significantly better than Biden, we weren't seeing the same correlation with the Senate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I mean, if Trump wins Pennsylvania by three and a half, you would think McCormick, I mean, he's probably gonna win because, you know, he might only win by one he's going to underperform Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But if there's that wiggle room, like if Trump only wins Pennsylvania by 0.7, McCormick's probably going to lose Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Trump can make, can get like a four or five point lead depending like a four point lead or a four point win in Arizona, you're talking about maybe Kerry Lake is able to equal one out.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Here's how things look, in the first poll of 687 likely voters, Trump leads with 49%, while Harris stands at 43%, giving Trump a solid six-point lead.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In another poll, Harris slightly improves to 44%, but Trump still holds 50%, again maintaining a six-point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The third poll shows Trump's lead narrowing a bit, with Harris at 44% and Trump at 47%, a difference of three points.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"With these numbers, Trump clearly has an edge in Ohio, though Harris remains within striking distance.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In the second poll, Harris moves ahead slightly with 48%, and Trump follows close behind with 47%, giving Harris a slim one-point lead.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"However, the third poll shows Trump pulling ahead again, with 46% for Trump and 43% for Harris, a three-point lead for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"In the final poll, Harris climbs to 45%, but Trump stays at 47%, maintaining a two-point lead.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So, while Trump leads in most of these polls, Michigan remains highly competitive, and it could swing either way.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I think when voters are presented with that stark contrast of Joe Biden's record and Trump's record, Joe Biden's vision for America and Trump's vision for America, that contrast will make sure we'll just send voters rushing to the polls again for Joe Biden, as they did in 2022, because we've seen the devastating consequences of a Trump presidency.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Two that show Trump up by one and one that shows Harris up by one.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Today, the Epic poll shows Harris with a three-point lead over Trump at 48 to 45 percent.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And there has been some concern about whether Kamala Harris would do as well in the Rust Bell as Joe Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
How do you feel about her chances here: i think her chances are pretty good.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I do, she's improved herself to me in the last three and a half for almost four years.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I don't know, i don't agree with what Trump wants.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I would vote probably to bring Trump back and become a Republican because of the different things that have happened while he was president.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"President Trump, he's a businessman.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I believe he's better for our country and making sure we come number one.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Both my parents are Trump supporters and they're like, you better vote for him.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump came.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"You have to assume that's now a distinct possibility, he says.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And that is where Harris has sent Obama absolutely hammering his successor's mental state there.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
There are questions about his competence.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
The other day he had a town hall meeting.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He decided, no, I'm not gonna answer questions anymore.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Have you noticed what he's like and that he wants unchecked power: harris almost certainly needs Michigan to win.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
You might remember all the way back to 2017 when he back then did an anti-Trump diss and shouted out Obama.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
The news tonight is that he and Obama will appear together at this rally.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"He also told his fans, Eminem did, that he was drawing a line against Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That you couldn't be, he said, an Eminem fan and still rock with everything Trump was doing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris's closing argument is also not only hitting that threat, which you just saw again, and she's been doing that really daily, but mixing that with a kind of third party validation or credibility check for voters who might not already be with her or might still be figuring out where they land in these final two weeks.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"When he's not complaining, he's trying to sell you stuff.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Have you noticed that, who does that: gold sneakers, $100,000 watch, supposed to be Swiss watch, he says, the best watch.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Why are you selling a watch, what are you doing, do you think Donald Trump ever changed his diaper: oh, no.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He'd be like, Jeeves.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Jeeves, change that diaper, tim's got skills, the other day I found out he can take a vintage truck apart and put it back together again.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"You think Donald Trump can do that: they say, well, you want to get rid of Obamacare.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Thanks very much, i think tonight, really interesting job for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"For a while now to a lot of people, I think she's an idea.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She needs to start being more than an idea, more than not Donald Trump and not Joe Biden, right: well, tonight is really the first night many Americans are going to see and hear from the vice president.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"At the same time, she does have to run a centrist course.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"This election is going to be decided by the middle, and she's got to make sure those centrist hear something that appeals to them.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris is going to have to find a way to thread that needle.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's where she has to stay and she has to appeal, while at the same time showing she understands what is happening to the Palestinian people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She was on The Daily Show.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Tonight she actually takes the stage.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Talk about her presence in all of this and how important we're reminded again of how central Michigan is to this race, right: well, I think one thing everybody should realize right now is that Governor Whitmer is, for lack of a better way to say it, a rock star on the Democratic side.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You watch her appearances throughout the week at those caucuses, those state breakfasts.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She was one of the most sought after people at those caucuses.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
I think she is speaking tonight and I think that's very interesting because she has an unusual appeal to independent voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She is particularly good at it.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"One of the interesting things also is she is, outside of Robert Kennedy, the most popular politician amongst Kennedy voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
I'm going to look for her to make an appeal to those centrists and those Kennedy voters in Michigan here tonight.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I don't want to abstain from voting entirely because if Trump gets elected, then it's it feels very much like something that I could have had a part in preventing.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Very confident, and as we know, this is a critical part of the population that Donald Trump is aiming to court.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But the Harris campaign, as you pointed out earlier, in contrast to the Trump campaign, says that the RFK endorsement will not make a difference in these states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And Jake, it is notable that the Harris campaign made their own statement reaching out to RFK Jr. supporters in the wake of him deciding to make this endorsement.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
One of the things the Trump campaign did this year that I think was very sharp was it wasn't just out about dropping literature and putting up yard signs.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So, Levora, meantime, the Cook Poll also shows Harris with a three-point lead in Michigan that is within the margin of error.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"The majority of the population voted for Barack Obama in the past, then for Donald Trump and Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Support for Donald Trump runs high here.,Donald Trump,Michigan
But there's also those who fear what the consequences will be if Trump is not elected.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump of course flipped it barely in 2016, and then it moved a little bit back to the Democrats in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But the key is between 2012 and 2020, the Trump era, the state as a whole got a lot less Democratic.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"One is despite the state getting less Democratic, there are nine counties that got more Democratic in the Trump era.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now the Democratic margin down to like 10, can Trump squeeze more out of this population-wise, relatively small share of the state: and then this is half the state in terms of where the vote is.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"These are places where Trump made gains, sometimes big gains in 2016, then lost ground in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump won them by double digits in 2016, then gave back ground in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Who is voting for Donald Trump in 24: it's possible.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Who's voting for Kamala Harris here: absolutely, no.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"No, not possible, there's nothing she can do or say for us to change our mind.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Why are you voting for Donald Trump: because my main goal is to get someone who is actively funding a genocide out of office.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Is your vote for Donald Trump a vote endorsing Donald Trump, or is it a vote against Kamala Harris: against Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Donald Trump has said he will reinstate the Muslim ban.,Donald Trump,Michigan
He said that last time.,Donald Trump,Michigan

Trump is definitely bad news for this country.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So I would not, with a protest vote, vote for Trump, some would argue that a vote for Jill Stein is a vote for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Exactly right, that's fascinating, all right, how about in the key states, yeah, how about in the key states: you know, it's not just when you tally up the electoral votes, Harris likely must carry three of these four states to win, and these are the states most likely to determine the electoral college.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris with that 276 electoral votes because she carries these Great Lake battleground states, right, but let's just say we flip Pennsylvania and the polls don't match the result exactly right.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"David Plouffe, who's working for the Harris campaign, says all seven swing states are within one point.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Have we ever seen so many crucial states so close, no, I went back since 1972 of the final Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin polls ever been so tight: no, no they have not.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"We have never had a year where any one of these states was within one point, and this year, John, all three of them are within one point.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's a historically close campaign, whether you look at the national polls or at the state polls, like we just did, and I think we just got knighted.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So this may take a while, given the fact that David Plouffe, the senior advisor to the Harris campaign, Sarah says, some of these states are going to be decided by less than a percentage point.",Kamala Harris,Michigan

"You noted, I think she's sitting down with Telemundo.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's sitting down with NBC News.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And in each one of these interviews that she's doing, also gonna do a CNN town hall tomorrow with us in suburban Philadelphia and Delaware County, Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Their main goal, her main goal has been to draw a sharp contrast with Trump on every issue at every moment of the day.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And I'd be surprised if that's not what comes through in these interviews she's doing today, because their goal is to remind voters of the negatives of Donald Trump, because we see in a lot of polling that a lot of voters remember the positive sense of the economy or having more money in their pockets.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And they want to remind voters of that as they go into the voting booth.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Maybe some among people who identify as Republicans, but certainly among independent voters who have previously voted Republican, mostly on economic issues, but find Trump a threat to their rights, their values, and a receptive to the message that he's a threat to democracy itself.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So the events that Harris did yesterday with Liz Cheney speaks to some of their concerns, but these are the same voters who were saying to the Harris campaign, look, we don't like Donald Trump, but we know who Donald Trump is.",Kamala Harris,Michigan

"Donald Trump has unveiled a new secret weapon in the race to the White House, the Muslim vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So if there is a big third party result and that leads to Trump winning Michigan and then through that winning the White House, how do you think the community will feel about that: i think they'll be quite happy.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I voted for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan

"Now, that's not going to be true for everyone, she will get some votes in Dearborn amongst the Muslim community.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But I heard Mustafa, who you saw in that package, the councillor, he said that within the Muslim community here, saying you're going to vote for Harris is like saying you were going to vote for Trump in 2016.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"One of the things I would say is the way in which the media explains Donald Trump's offering is very different, I think, to what you pick up when you're on the ground.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And it's as simple as that, and so the idea of Trump being mostly about the economy is a very strong element, I think, in the way voters who are inclined towards him are responding.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I spent today talking to some auto workers who are going to vote for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Everything will seem obvious in hindsight, but the fact of the matter is the Harris campaign can't really measure that as much as just being there on the ground and talking to people and trying to deliver the message that most recently has been, as we heard in the Fox News interview this week, I am not a rubber stamp for Joe Biden.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She'll be, by the way, headed to Lansing to a GM plant.",Kamala Harris,Michigan

"She's vicious, she wants to deport people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And she wants to start by deporting Brett Baer Fox.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But where is this all going: well, she said in a video, I don't know if you saw this, of all people, Molly Smith, the Saturday Night Live, Mary Catherine Gallagher.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There wasn't a lot of clapping or laughing while that was being played, just like when Donald Trump was talking.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And Donald Trump got pretty tough, calling out Kamala Harris and her level of intelligence.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She called out her husband for having an affair, and Tim Walz for not being a real man.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Joe, just quickly, in 30 seconds, there was a really fascinating story in the Wall Street Journal about Poly Market, the Wall Street Journal reporting that basically this big surge that Donald Trump saw maybe could be tied back to four accounts.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If Donald Trump does not win this election, though, expect him to point back to these numbers to call into question the final result.",Donald Trump,Michigan

"In September, Trump was polling at 50.6%, with a 3.4-point lead over Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now in October, Trump is at 50.2%, while Harris has gained slightly to 47.3%.",Donald Trump,Michigan

"On the other hand, Harris has a much higher negative rating at 54%, compared to her 45% positive, which leaves her with a net favorability of minus 9%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"However, Harris leads among women with 48%, while Trump trails with 44%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"What's important to note here is that Trump has gained 0.2% in the last week, which signals a potential shift in his favor.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"However, Trump's numbers have been improving with a 0.5% increase over the last week and a 1.9% increase since last month.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Real clear politics shows a different result with Trump leading by 1.2 points in polls at 48.4%, while Harris is at 47.2%.",Donald Trump,Michigan

The Harris campaign has privately expressed concerns about losing Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
This scenario has raised alarms within the Harris camp as the Midwest becomes increasingly competitive.,Kamala Harris,Michigan

Trump reacted by wandering aimlessly around the stage for 16 minutes.,Donald Trump,Michigan

"I think she better get on her hands and her knees and start crying out to the one and true living God because if not, she's gonna meet her maker real quick.",Kamala Harris,Michigan

"And as we begin this video, even many of the polls are fraudulent, designed by Republicans to depress Harris voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And perhaps set the stage for Donald Trump to claim a rigged election.,Donald Trump,Michigan

"But before you go, I want to get to the breaking news tonight, that physicians have deemed Vice President Harris to be in excellent health after the White House released her medical records this weekend.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
Trump said he would release his medical records two months ago.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"That hasn't happened, but in response, his campaign referred to a vague letter posted his Truth Social account in November from Trump's self-described personal physician, along with reports from Texas Congressman, Dr. Ronnie Jackson, who treated Trump after his July assassination attempt, all of which say that the former president is in excellent health, but without specifics for the oldest major party candidate in our history.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Should he have to release his records now, Congresswoman, and should this be a bigger campaign issue, given his age, since they made an Asia issue out of Joe Biden, where's all of the hollering and screaming about the oldest candidate in US history that won't release specific health records: every chapter, that's exactly what I was going to say.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So Kamara Harris just got some bad news.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, it's kind of like at this point, every single day, she's getting bad news.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And so what we're going to do is react to this interview and show you additional clips to justify why this is a big problem for her campaign.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's for sure, who's voting for Kamala Harris here: absolutely, no.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Number one, you can tell that the lady asking the questions has Trump derangement syndrome.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"She's trying to use fair tactics in the way that she is conducting this interview, which I find to be interesting.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Like, oh, Trump is going to enforce a Muslim travel ban.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But hey, I guess that's too much to ask, right: but what's funny is how the voter checked her and said, hey, listen.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Just because you guys say that Trump is a threat to democracy, just because you say I'm supposed to be scared, doesn't mean I'm going to believe it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Now, there's a foreign affairs analyst that went on CNN and said exactly what I just said and what you heard in that interview and just look at the face of these people on the panel when she says it.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And in the care poll that came out several months ago, Kamala Harris was in third place among Muslims in several of those states behind both Donald Trump and Jill Stein.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
So there is this position that she's in.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now, before I get to showing you the electoral college map and how Michigan could be one of the reasons why she will lose this election, let's take a look at this interview she did right after her rally today.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And that is a problem for her campaign because she continues to spend more time bashing Trump than telling people who she really is.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So that is just bad news, oK, now here's what Trump had to say in response to that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So I don't see him voting for her.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"This would be the outcome, trump would have 312 electoral votes and Harris would have 226.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So if they say Trump is up by three, Trump is more than likely up by three.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Trump is definitely up in North Carolina.,Donald Trump,Michigan
It's been a very long time since a Democrat won this state.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So obviously, if Trump wins Michigan, he's at 277 and he's the next president of the United States.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Even if he doesn't even win Pennsylvania, because we know Pennsylvania happens to be the state that most people say, if a candidate wins Pennsylvania, they're more likely to win the presidency.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"I'm more likely to believe that Trump should win, but I don't rule out the possibility that he'll lose because it's just like last time around.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I assume he would win Georgia didn't happen.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"OK, the bottom line is this, she is not an authentic person.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
She is not willing to show us who she really is.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
It doesn't show what type of leadership will exist if she was to win in regards to Joe Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Is there a difference: she hasn't shown that when they ask her about Joe Biden and how she would be different.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She still gives us canned answers.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
Kamala Harris represents the unknown.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
And that is a disaster for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So Harris with an advantage nationally now on average of 1.1 points over Trump, four years ago on this day, the national poll average was Joe Biden by 7.4 points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But the margins are so slim, one thing to think about though, look at the three where Harris does have a small, small advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If she does hold Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, if there's no surprise anywhere else, she will have exactly 270 electoral votes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And from Trump's standpoint, to show you how tight this is, look, the poll right now has him, the average has him slightly ahead in North Carolina, slightly ahead in Georgia.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"If he gets those two, all he would need to get exactly 270 is to change Pennsylvania where the average right now is just six tenths of one point to Harris.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Do that, and Trump has exactly 270, well, that explains why the candidates have been parked in Pennsylvania for the last couple months for the most part.",Donald Trump,Michigan
I'm curious because you have been a Donald Trump supporter for a long time.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"He's now facing Harris, who is very different from Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And to have what Donald Trump and the team have been working on all these months and now have overnight turned over, it seems like he's having a little bit of trying to figure out what approach to use, not attack, but I mean, what approach to use on this.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And I will continue to advise President Trump to stick with the message of his policies.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"What he accomplished in his four years as president, what he anticipates accomplishing in four years, sticking to the issues of economic independence, addressing skyrocketing inflation, making addressing the fact that America is no longer competitive in a global economy.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"When he talks about his record, the voters generally aligned with him and I think will be very successful in November.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And he's coming in a fact twice this coming week here.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I know he's coming to Flint and I'm hearing I'm hearing West side of the state too, maybe that's correct.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Hardest working candidate in modern history definitely sets the bar for putting himself out there and giving it all he's got.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I thought that Vice President Harris did a beautiful job of really distinguishing what she stands for versus what former President Trump stands for.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"If you went to it thinking you're a Trump supporter, you probably think it was a three on one fight between Trump, the moderators and the vice president, right, and then there's the middle, right, and the question about them is, did they watch, and if they did, did they stay up late enough to watch the whole thing, what did they get: apparently, there were like 70 million people watched their war.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And basically endorsed Harris, and I think I heard that something like two point three million people liked what she had to say about this within 30 minutes of this.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"You know, Kamala Harris was seeking the endorsement of Cheney.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And I think the Bush family as well, and she's running as a Democrat, really highlights the fact that Donald Trump is the political outsider in this race.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That is, he's really up against the permanent political elite class in Washington.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
He's done a wonderful job facing this uphill battle.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I don't think there will be, donald Trump never turns away from a debate.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He loves the opportunity to show his leadership, his policies, his values and his his approach to leading the nation.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So I would be very eager and excited to see him again.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"So it's very tight, trump is actually ahead of Harris in this state by two points with Arab American voters nationally.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"The genocide happened under Biden, the Harris administration, and when I showed them that we can unseat them.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And what happened after that: during Trump, we did not have any war.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"For them, we had less taxes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump does not believe, as far as I know, and I haven't heard Republican leadership say that there's any genocide going on other than what the point of ambition was on October 7th.",Donald Trump,Michigan
So he doesn't agree with that point.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"In the final stretch of the 2024 US presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is focusing her efforts on winning over young voters in Michigan, a critical battleground state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Despite Harris leading narrowly in the polls, a surprising, uncommitted movement is emerging, and even a small number of holdouts could swing the entire election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"As Harris tours the state, addressing the youth's concerns about climate change, student debt, and jobs, the race grows tighter.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Will her outreach efforts solidify the youth vote, or will these uncommitted voters remain on the sidelines, possibly deciding the next president of the United States?",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Vice President Harris has a slight edge in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"It's an area that Trump won by three in 2016, a lot of voters of Dutch heritage, but Biden won it by six.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Republican candidates had won that area by double digits, but it's an area where Donald Trump hasn't really connected.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"But again, he's putting together a different coalition than your traditional Republicans in that state.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"He certainly is, you know those post-debate polls, they show Trump leading Harris by one point.",Donald Trump,Michigan
And also we spent a lot of time with Donald Trump for the last year leading when he was facing Joe Biden.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"It's a very unusual position for Donald Trump in his political career, but we also see sometimes the polling doesn't necessarily reflect his strengths.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Trump won there in 2016, but in 2020 the Great Lakes state went blue with Biden claiming victory.",Donald Trump,Michigan
You talk about 99% certainty of what Trump will do.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"And what I can say is that with 100% certainty, had this had been occurring under the Trump's presidency, we would have seen Democrats stand up and find their moral compass as they did when he moved the embassy.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"However, with the duopoly and the nature of politics in this country, because it is a Democratic president, you're never going to have Democrats step up, especially during an election year, and say, what is he he's doing is wrong.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So even if Trump was to do exactly the same thing that Biden is doing, I have a little bit of hope that perhaps Democrats would find their moral compass and stand up and say that we would need a ceasefire by now.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So that's one thing, on the other note, Trump, as we know, in the wild card, and we've seen even after, towards the end of his prior presidency, that he soured on Biden.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And I can only hope that due to some personality conflict or serendipitously, he solves the crisis in the Middle East.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And for our viewers, you've written and I quote you here, there is no greater insult to me, a Muslim, Yemeni American woman, or to my community than to assume we do not understand the ramifications of a second Trump presidency.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Last time, as I understand it, back in 2020, you wrote in Bernie Sanders in the 2020 election, there's a possibility of doing that again, given the risks of a Trump presidency.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And with the numbers as they are, if the election were held today with Harris leading in Michigan and Trump trailing about three to four points on average, you have about 6% of voters who are voting for other.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"And if the election were held today, Harris would win.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Is Trump surging in the blue wall state of Michigan: this is Cocteau, and let's talk some politics.",Donald Trump,Michigan
A massive net gain of eight points for Harris over where Biden had previously been in the race.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"A net gain of four for Harris over her standing in late July in the contest, in their next poll in mid-September though, they found Trump sustaining his level of support at 47 while Harris lost a point to hit 49.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"A net gain of one point for Trump, for Bloomberg Morning Consult, they have shown some wild swings for Harris and Trump in their polling with their RV surveys.",Donald Trump,Michigan
A net gain of three for Harris over where Biden had been in the race previously.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
A five point improvement for Harris over where Biden had stood in the race.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"An improvement of two for Harris over Biden standing just prior to his exit, however those gains have been erased in their latest poll at the end of September with Trump sustaining his level of support at 47 while Harris dropped two to hit 45.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
However their most recent poll at the end of September showed Trump gaining a point to hit 49 while Harris remained steady.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But what do you think, is Trump gaining in Michigan or does Harris have a sufficiently strong lead to hold on to this blue wall state: let me know what you think in the comments below.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Harris started like a woman.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now she's slipping, marcy Paul is nervous.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"When Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate in July, Ms. Paul was hopeful, as she saw the Vice President go off like a rocket in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But with less than a month to go before election day, Harris' honeymoon period in Michigan could be ending, leaving her pathway to victory less certain.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"There is no obvious solution for Harris to break ahead, said Michigan State University politics professor Matt Grossman.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Harris's entrance into the race led to more than 100,000 new volunteers in Michigan, while she has visited Michigan more than any other state besides Pennsylvania, according to her campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Trump has also made at least a dozen stops in Michigan this year, but some campaign operatives have sounded the alarm that his campaign has let old-fashioned ground game tactics, like door knocking and billboards, slide in several swing states, including Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But Harris is ramping up her campaign visits this week after at least three Michigan Democratic lawmakers warned of slipping support.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But just to show you how that can change based on a couple of states falling in a particular direction, let's assume just for the purposes of our conversation that Pennsylvania, the biggest battleground on the map, goes for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
You go from that 50-50 race to now Harris having an almost 80% chance of winning.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"North Carolina, which went for Donald Trump once.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Georgia went for Donald Trump once and then flipped back.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Again, that's an 80% Trump chance.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"We know that Harris is gonna do well just like Joe Biden did, but it's right outside of there where the numbers couldn't be important.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So again, that's where Harris has to come in very big, similar story in Wisconsin with some interesting differences.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Michigan's in the spotlight as 2024's election hangs on a razor's edge, polls show Harris and Trump neck and neck, but who's truly in the lead: before we jump into the details, subscribe to my channel and like this video.",Kamala Harris,Michigan

"Donald Trump caused an upset when he took Michigan in 2016 by 11,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Last night, as you may know, Donald Trump went on the Joe Rogan experience after Kamala continues to bleed support from young people, especially with young men and Trump just knows how to continuously eat until those margins, right, but another demographic we've talked a lot about on this channel is Arab and Muslim voters who do not really make a huge difference statistically nationwide, but they do in a very key and pivotal swing state known as Michigan, right: you may have heard of that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
And Kamala just got some more devastating news with that Arab vote that we'll tell you about here today.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But the numbers are actually worse when you specifically focus on likely voters, okay: because when you look at likely voters, Trump leads Harris 46% to 42%.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Only 79% of Democrats support Harris, while 89% of Republicans support Trump.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"That's a big deal, right, and how has Donald Trump responded to that: well, take a look.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Today at his rally in the state of Michigan, he just got a pretty big endorsement from numerous members of the Arab and Muslim community.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But it tells you a lot about how much our politics has changed and largely because of this very effective messaging by Trump that he's going to be the peace candidate.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Well, Trump saying that he'll stop the war, kind of both sides, find ways, find angles, they can be happy with that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
But take a listen to what happened at his rally today.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"But again, see, here's the thing, is Trump is pro-Israel, right: nobody really denies that or argues that.",Donald Trump,Michigan
Are you ready: the second prediction is Donald J. Trump will be the 47th president of the United States of America.,Donald Trump,Michigan
I'm sure the Kamala campaign is just going to say that was a Trump supporter.,Donald Trump,Michigan
You have the Arab leaders going out endorsing Trump on stage.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"Yeah, she might have a problem on her hands.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"This was 2016, the shock result where Donald Trump came from behind and defeated Hillary Clinton despite losing the popular vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"Then in 2020, back in the middle of COVID, after the rather tumultuous four years of a Trump presidency, Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate beat Donald Trump, donald Trump did not get a second term because Joe Biden swept both the popular vote, in fact, he had more than 50% of the popular vote, a massive difference, 51.3 and 46.9, almost a 5% gap in the popular vote and more importantly, that 5% gap translated into 303 electoral college votes for Joe Biden and just 235 for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"So 2024, why is it being predicted to be such a close, such a tight race: this is the starting point for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She starts with 175 strong seats because these are states like California, Washington State, Illinois and of course, the whole bunch of states in the East Coast, all the way from Maine and New Hampshire up in the North, down to Maryland and of course, the DC area.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"So that takes her to 226, so 226 is where Kamala Harris starts election night on.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
What about Donald Trump: donald Trump has a solid safe seats of 188 electoral college votes.,Donald Trump,Michigan
So this is the starting point for Donald Trump at 219 and Kamala Harris at 226.,Donald Trump,Michigan
"In 2016, when Trump won, and this was the shock because a Republican had not won those states until 20 years prior to that, when he won Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, these are the so-called blue wall states.",Donald Trump,Michigan
"And for Kamala Harris, these three states are must win.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"She has to win Wisconsin, she has to win Michigan with 15 electoral college votes, Wisconsin with 10, and Pennsylvania, which is the biggest one with 19 electoral college votes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"These three add up to about 44 electoral college votes and these three are must win for the Democratic nominee because if she doesn't win any one of these states, then she has to win the remaining, which is far tighter.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
That is where both Harris and Donald Trump will be focusing their energies on in the last few days of this campaign.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
She's in Michigan today.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
What's her game plan there: you can tell it's still a toss up.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Now we know that the Harris campaign has invested significant time, energy and money into visiting college campuses all across the country.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
They really want to energize that vote.,Kamala Harris,Michigan
"But even though most African Americans will vote for Kamala Harris, latest polls show she's lagging behind among black men, especially in the country's poorest areas.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"I fear that because of the lack of understanding of the class divide in black America, that the Harris campaign may have missed the vote.",Kamala Harris,Michigan
"Yeah, I want to say what she is.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I'm just I'm just like, you know, could this be something that people who who saying not to vote for Kamala Harris is some things they might say.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yeah, like okay one now you crazy cuz she said character matters right and and even I done seen that Kamala Harris does do this when she get in front of certain audiences she act a little different like she was talking to the people in Georgia.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She not no southern person, but she was talking with a southern accent and then you know and then she get in front of other people she talk different but also another thing is the fact that for a long time, she never like disclose that she was black until you know, I guess when she aligned herself with Joe Biden cuz I think even when she was when she was a DA wasn't she before she became before she got into politics like this in San Francisco, but I think she's sworn in as being Indian but I'm just saying what you say to those things.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yes, been switch up all you want to cuz Trump vote and say these motherfuckers assholes these you know what I mean these people are this and that and you talking about that, bro.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The worst thing you could call a motherfucker, but you mad because this lady switching up her accent cuz she go to a different region.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If she wasn't black, who cares **** she's still better than Trump.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Like straight the **** up, you see what he wanna do.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Cuz just imagine if Trump win this ****.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean and even bro, you'd have heard him say it yourself.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"What that mean to you, well, like, why you feel about that since you're gonna say some **** about Harris, how do you feel about him saying that, hey, what you think that mean: oh, well, like I said, I was just being devil's advocate.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump won all the **** states that had a whole bunch like a whole bunch of electoral votes, but in the last time, he lost by both.",Donald Trump,Arizona
even though Trump said he got nothing to do with that.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I think he like like and I just feel like we can't let that happen. ****,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But hey, Republican speaking now against the Republican candidate, man, i mean, **** what did Trump do for your ass though: hey, man, I feel like ain't no president ever agenda is to help black people.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Man, not even not even cuz I ain't **** you know what I mean, **** I'm I'm I'm in full belief that Trump will win because **** **** everyone they more will always be you know what I mean: trump Trump Trump Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I think Trump go weird because I don't know.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So January 6th makes Donald Trump absolutely unfit for office.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Single-handedly, Donald Trump single-handedly changed the Republican Party from what it was.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I would say that who Donald Trump character is does not align with the type of person that I want to be as a disciple of Jesus Christ.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Mr. Trump lives in a world of chaos, of political and partisan fighting.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's just simply not going to happen under a Trump presidency.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And so that's why people like me are bothered when we see Donald Trump's unapologetic character flaws.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Today, Trump has a slight edge in three of them.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"538 forecast Trump with a one point advantage over Harris in the model margin, recent polls, we have five of the most recent polls.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump leads four of them and with fairly comfortable margins showings as well.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think it's kind of chaotic, but I am really excited that Kamala is running.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I did get a little bit nervous when we have found out that Trump was gonna be running again, but when they had kind of did that switcheroo and had Kamala come in, it kind of gave a lot more hope for what was coming.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I feel like for most of the stuff that I hear or see on as far as her ads that she's putting out, it's mostly more similar, not identical, but more similar to when Obama was running where he did not slander his opponent.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He's on the slander.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's it, that's all he's not talking about what his plans are.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's just slandering at this point, which I don't like that and I really wish that it would be more about what is, what are your plans as a president versus what are you just want to trash talk the next person because we can always say something bad about somebody.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think Kamala Harris and her VP pick are much more hopeful and positive for everybody, so I'm looking forward to November.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It just feels very positive, which is I mean just obviously completely the opposite of Trump's campaign, just in general.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She's gonna be amazing as our president and our vice president.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
The Trump doesn't have a message.,Donald Trump,Arizona
All he does is talk about himself.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Oh absolutely, Harris side's more positive, we're not derogatory.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Absolutely, absolutely, she can take the state.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Biden took the state, so Harris absolutely can take the state too.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But Donald Trump tanked it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said stop the bill.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Because you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump is at 45 percent, while Harris is at 42 percent.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I followed Kamala Harris down here for what is the Vice President's first trip to America's southern border in three years.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Joe Biden won this state by the narrowest of margins in 2020, and Donald Trump currently leads in polls this time around, although very narrowly.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I've just been watching her hold a rally here where she promised to take tough action on border security and reducing illegal immigration.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It's all part of an attempt by the Democratic presidential candidate to confront a key weakness she has in the White House race, with polls showing her consistently behind Donald Trump on the issue of border security and illegal immigration.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
It was all done by comrade Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"In her speech tonight, Ms Harris promised tighter curbs on asylum seekers and tough penalties for those who cross the border illegally, and particularly for those who do so repeatedly.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"At the same time, she promised a humane approach to the immigration system and talked about a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For years, it's all part of a delicate balance Kamala Harris is trying to tread as she seeks to win the White House with a broad voter coalition.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For all the careful calibration of Kamala Harris' trip here, and the message that she sought to deliver, it may not be enough to sway voters' image of her as someone who can't be trusted on border security.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump's response to her trip here today may resonate more.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She asked why Kamala Harris, after almost four years in office, had not already enacted the proposals she was putting forward tonight.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But unlike Kamala, who always complains and doesn't do anything, I keep saying, why don't you do: i saw Marsha the other day.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Why doesn't she, why didn't she do it four years ago almost?",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And when you talk about that energy and people coming to the campaign, becoming politically active right now, did that come post Kamala Harris joining or taking the top of the ticket, it was that in the midst of sort of the Biden question, when did you start to see people engage: more people got engaged when Kamala Harris stepped in the race.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"According to 270 to Win, the average of recent polls shows Kamala Harris at around 47.1% and Donald Trump at around 48.9%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"A specific poll by the NY Times-Ciena College conducted from October 10 to 12, 2024 shows Trump leading with 51% to Harris's 46%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Other recent polls, the Wall Street Journal poll from October 11, 2024, indicates Harris at 48% and Trump at 46%, while the Emerson College poll from October 10, 2024 shows Trump at 51% and Harris at 48%, consistency and variability.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And Donald Trump is named as an unindicted co-conspirator.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"There were seven names in addition to the fake electors who were named, seven other names that were redacted in the document below and per the Washington Post and other sources and we can independently confirm here at the Midas Touch Network that the other seven who were indicted are as close to Donald Trump as you can be.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"They include Mark Meadows was just indicted in Arizona, Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, who already pled guilty in Fulton County, Georgia.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I've talked about it on legal AF as to how Boris Epstein, who's the inside conciliary for Donald Trump, who's got his fingerprints on almost everything that's been illegal about Donald Trump in his attempt to cling to power and overturn our democracy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And yet he had avoided, he was an unindicted co-conspirator with Jack Smith.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He wasn't mentioned at all in the final in Fulton County.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But Chris Mays and her investigative team over the last year and a half, and we've been tracking it on legal AF from the very beginning when she announced she was going to open this investigation, she said, I've waited, I'm paraphrasing, I've waited long enough.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"When I'm done, I want to get your view on why Trump was left out of this party that's been arranged.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, if I'm thinking, why was Trump an unindicted co-conspirator at this stage: my view is just time will tell if he goes from unindicted to indicted.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I think that this is an approach to put pressure on some of the other indicted co-conspirators now to actually flip on Donald Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And because Donald Trump's own self preservation is on the line, because Donald Trump's own freedom is on the line, that's sometimes where Donald Trump will try to use others as pawns in the proceedings to protect himself.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So I think tactically you don't include him here yet.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And by the way, Donald Trump's been indicted now in four other jurisdictions that are dealing with him as well.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So Donald Trump is not just not out of the danger zone yet.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He is close to the danger zone.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Why give Donald Trump an out to be able to argue or play this case against another case: she'll watch it carefully.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She'll see what happens with the federal election cases and the Mar-a-Lago case.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And she's got, as you said, plenty of time on the clock to get a cooperating witness or two against Donald Trump and go from unindicted to indicted as quickly as you can say, Orange Mafia.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Michael Popak, you, I, Dean Adal and our legal team here at the Midas Touch Network and Legal AF will be covering the oral arguments before the United States Supreme Court, where Trump is claiming that he has absolute immunity to order SEAL Team Six to kill his political opponents.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But then you talk to women, and a majority of them, I'll show you here, feel that the Trump campaign is paying too little attention to the concerns of women.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But now I'm in women's land because I am a Harris supporter.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I was here in 20, 2022, and here now we've got a situation where a lot of Republicans are voting for the Harris Walls ticket.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"There are some Republicans who think this thing has to burn to the ground and a new party has to emerge and others who think that if Donald Trump loses, they can try to reclaim their party.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I've never got a real balance on where most Republicans who are not voting for Donald Trump feel about that.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Of course, if Donald Trump wins, then that remains in limbo for a while.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Some of this change can be attributed to demographic shifts, while other factors include dissatisfaction with Donald Trump's rhetoric and policies.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump, despite being a leader for the Republican Party, has alienated a significant portion of Arizona's conservative base, particularly those loyal to the late Senator John McCain dot McCain, a war hero and longtime senator from Arizona, was a revered figure in the state, with many Republicans continuing to hold him in high regard even after his passing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, Trump's repeated insults toward McCain have not gone unnoticed by voters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"In a recent interview with Fox and Friends, Trump was asked if he would attempt to reconcile with Haley and her supporters in order to unify the party ahead of the general election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Rather than showing a willingness to bring the party together, Trump boasted about his primary victories, claiming he had defeated her by margins as high as 50, 60, or even 90 points in some states.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"With Trump alienating long-standing GOP figures like McCain and Haley, there's a real risk that many of their supporters will either stay home on election day or cross party lines to vote for the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, like other groups within the GOP, many Mormons have become disillusioned with Trump's behavior and rhetoric, which they see as being incompatible with their religious beliefs.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"This is particularly evident in the way Trump conducts himself in religious settings, where his use of profanity and disrespectful comments have turned off many devout Mormons.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"While it is true that Trump has made gains with some Latino voters, particularly in areas like Santa Cruz County along the Mexico border, where the Latino vote shifted 16 points toward Trump between 2016 and 2020, it's important to remember that the Latino electorate is not a monolith.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"While some Latino voters may be drawn to Trump's message of economic growth and border security, others are more concerned with issues like healthcare, education, and immigration reform, issues that align more closely with the Democratic Party's platform.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be enough to counteract the gains that Trump has made with certain segments of the Latino electorate.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"During his speech with Tucker Carlson on late Thursday night in Arizona, Donald Trump just threatened the life of Liz Cheney.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump said, let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels at her.",Donald Trump,Arizona
This is what Donald Trump just said.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Play the clip, and I don't blame him for sticking with his daughter, but his daughter is a very dumb individual, very dumb.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I think that Donald Trump just committed a felony right there.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Also Donald Trump just seems very unwell.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He was making noises throughout the night, just making weird noises while instead of even speaking here, watch.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Come on, then Donald Trump said that he believes there are murderers and drug dealers in the audience.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump continues by calling Adam Schiff a watermelon head.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"When Donald Trump continues to start talking about how the election's being stolen from him in Pennsylvania, he's getting a lot of bad data this evening, which we've been telling you about here as we've been reporting with the best analyst in the business.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump's freaking out about the data.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"When Donald Trump talks about a certain pastor who says that he's great, I don't know what he's talking about.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And he was a big supporter.,Donald Trump,Arizona
But he said he may not know the Bible quite as well as other people are supposed to.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And the more pressure Kamala, the more pressure Kamala has, the more you see it happening.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
That's Donald Trump's message to women.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He can't even get into a truck.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Watch this, did you see his right leg there: you see, again, those are signs and symptoms of mini strokes, in my opinion.",Donald Trump,Arizona
There's a reason why he's not releasing his medical records anyway.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Contrast that to Vice President Kamala Harris this evening in Las Vegas, where she mocks Donald Trump about his teeny tiny crowds.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Play the clip, you may have seen, I talked in Washington, D.C. the other day, he likes to compare crowd sizes.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And finally, you have Jennifer Lopez giving a speech as well in Las Vegas this evening with Vice President Kamala Harris condemning Donald Trump for his awful statements that his campaign's made about the Puerto Rican community.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He has consistently worked to divide us.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"At Madison Square Garden, he reminded us who he really is and how he really feels.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And I don't blame him for sticking with his daughter, but his daughter is a very dumb individual, very dumb.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Let's turn to the 2024 race, you heard President Trump's remarks.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump's campaign suggested he would begin previewing his closing arguments Saturday night with election day barely two weeks away, but the former president kicked off his rally with a detailed story about Arnold Palmer, at one point even praising the late legendary golfer's genitalia.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Mr. Speaker, you're crossing all over the country.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's why Kamala Harris herself avoids the question.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I wonder how Trump's remarks, not just the one about Arnold Palmer on his, quote, manhood, but everything we've heard from Trump this week, how it fits in with the analysis that the New York Times offered a few days ago.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I know you wanna talk about policy, and I respect that, but the reason that Donald Trump is not up 10 points is because of comments like that one, where people do have concerns about his fitness, his acuity, and his stability.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Why is he talking about Arnold Palmer's penis in front of Pennsylvania voters: jake, you seem to like that line a lot.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Let me tell you that Donald Trump is doing rallies nonstop around the country.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I don't wanna be talking about this, donald Trump is out there saying it is- But you continue to, let's talk about- Because you won't address it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Wait a minute, hold on, he won't address it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He is out there talking to voters- No, I'll address it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"When President Trump is at a rally, sometimes he'll speak for two straight hours.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You're questioning his stamina, his mental acuity.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump does.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So he has fun at the rallies.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He says things that are off the cuff.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We could do that with Kamala Harris after a 20-minute event, because she does word salads, and she couldn't hold court like that without a teleprompter.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Meanwhile, the vice president Kamala Harris, she hopes to strengthen a political weak spot.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She will head to the border today in Arizona, southeastern corner, Chocochi's County.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump leads Harris by three points, 51 to 48 percent.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But it's a topic she feels she can potentially flip back on Trump.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Take a listen, donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on and told them to kill the bill.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution because he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.,Donald Trump,Arizona
You will hear Kamala claim that the reason the border is not secure is that Congress has refused to pass her atrocious border bill.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And Harris' visit today will be here in Border Patrol's Tucson, Arizona sector.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It's also a place where our Fox cameras have repeatedly captured scenes like this, border wall breaches and mass illegal crossings over and over.",Donald Trump,Arizona
This is nothing more than for her to check the box.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Where has she been: and back out here live, that is a question the local sheriff out here is wondering as well.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris is expected to arrive here later this afternoon.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She will deliver remarks later this afternoon.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And I know with the speech that she's going to lay out, but we'll see when that develops.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Is there a reason why she would pick that corner of Arizona in Douglas: i asked the sheriff and it's apparently because he personally invited her here.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Thursday night a small group of big political players in the Grand Canyon state greeted vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris at Sky Harbor International Airport she didn't address reporters but her supporters said they wouldn't miss the chance to welcome her to Arizona.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I've known the vice president for over 20 years we were in a leadership development program together I really respect her so why wouldn't I be here of course.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's a very inspirational person I've got a wonderful background story and very impressive I was today very impressed just by how personable she was how charming she was.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
The difference between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is the difference between chaos and sanity and incredible competency as well.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"According to recent CNN polls, Trump leads Harris by an 11-point margin on economic issues.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Foreign policy is another area where Trump is seen as more trustworthy, with a 7-point lead over Harris in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But Trump's plan would add almost $8 trillion by 2035, compared to Harris' plan, which would add almost $4 trillion.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"While Trump is seen as more capable of handling inflation by some, others note that the rate of change in consumer prices has moderated significantly since mid-2022, which could sway support towards Harris.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump has offered a broader range of tax cuts, including reducing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, while Harris' proposals are more focused on specific groups.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris is heading there today, again.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"A new Emerson College polling Real Clear World Survey reveals Trump topping Harris by 3 percentage amounts, with 50 percent to 47 among likely voters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Democrats have traditionally counted on this voting block, but if we can take anything away from recent polling, it's that Harris has work to do to win over more Latinos, specifically male Latinos.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"According to a recent USA Today Suffolk University survey, the GOP nominee is leading among male Latino voters ages 18 to 34, with 51 percent compared to Harris's 33 percent.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now among 35 to 49 year olds, Trump is polling 57 percent compared to Harris's 37 percent.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris also in Arizona a critical Senate race between the GOP nominee, Kerry Lake and Ruben Gallego, here to break this all down is Cameron Stevenson, the founding editor and chief political correspondent at the Cooper Courier.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He is based in Phoenix.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Whereas as you just talked about, the polling between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is fairly neck and neck.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And a lot of that has to do with, one, Trump has a strong history here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Although he lost in 2020, he has had a strong and confident base that has maintained through the years.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But certainly there was some reporting, and I heard sort of whisperings within the Trump camp that at one point they were worried about Kerry Lake, who is very controversial, kind of dragging his chances down in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But it doesn't seem like, from what you say, that's really a plausible scenario at this point: i would be surprised, and only because Donald Trump as a figure is, he's his own person.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He is very much an independent entity.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He came into the Republican Party and took it over, reshaped it in his image.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Unfortunately, there is a segment of the population of voters who are suspicious and skeptical of our election systems because so many lies and mistruths have been disseminated by people like Kerry Lake and especially Donald Trump with the big lie in his 2020 election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We spoke to new Trump supporters at Arizona State.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I like his policy on closed borders and I don't like illegal immigration.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He talks like I talk with my friends.,Donald Trump,Arizona
What I cannot understand is why anyone would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump is a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he wrote down that golden escalator nine years ago.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And when he's not complaining, he's trying to sell you stuff.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's got his gold sneakers.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's got the $100,000 watch.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's got – this is my favorite – he's got the Trump Bible.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Wants you to buy the Word of God, Donald Trump edition.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"His name's going to be on there, embossed, right next to Luke and Mark and Matthew.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Where these Bibles are made, so, Mr. Tough Guy on China, except when he can make a few bucks, hawking his Trump edition Bibles.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But he's doing it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And the reason he's doing it is because what he cares about is his ego and his money and his status.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's not thinking about you.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump sees power as nothing more than a means to his ends.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He wants the middle class to pay the price for another huge tax cut that would mostly help him and his country club buddies.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He doesn't care if he costs more women their reproductive freedoms because it won't make a difference in his life.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Vote, most of all, most of all, Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them, between the, quote, real Americans, which, by which he means his supporters, and the outsiders who don't support him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Because having people divided and angry and aggrieved and resentful, he figures that boosts his chances to get elected.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Have you seen him lately: i mean, he is out there, he's given two, two and a half hour speeches, just word salads.",Donald Trump,Arizona
You have no idea what he's talking about.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's talking about Hannibal Lecter.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's talking about this, he's talking about that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He held a town hall meeting where he's, he just, let me explain, because I've done a lot of town hall meetings.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He just decided, you know what, I'm going to stop taking questions.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And then he's swaying to Ave Maria and YMCA for about half an hour.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And the good news is Kamala Harris is ready to do the job.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"This is a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice, who need a champion.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Somebody who was raised in the middle class, believes in the values that built this country, worked her way through college in McDonald's, served with distinction in every office she has ever held, who is as prepared for the job as any nominee for President has ever been.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's who Kamala is, and in the White House, she will have an outstanding partner in Governor Tim Walz.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You think Donald Trump can do that, for that matter, do you think Donald Trump has ever changed a tire in his life: he's like having Jeeves change his tire.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The point is, if you elect Kamala and Tim, they will not be focused on their problems.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
They will be focused on yours.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
They understand that too many folks not just here in Arizona but across the country are still struggling to pay the bills.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump's plan is to give another massive tax cut to billionaires and big corporations.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, some people, because I'm having conversations around the country with folks as I go campaigning, and I'll hear some people say, well, I remember the economy when those first two years with Trump, they were pretty good.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So when I handed over the economy to Donald Trump, we had had 75 straight months of job growth.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And all he did with it was give a tax cut to people who did not need one and drove up the deficit in the process.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And now he wants to do it again.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, in fairness, his other big economic plan is to slap tariffs on everything from food to TVs.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But this is basically a Trump sales tax that could cost the average family almost $4,000 a year.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If you think prices are high now, Donald Trump's message is, you ain't seen nothing yet.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"When it comes to health care, Donald Trump's got one answer, and that is, and Obamacare.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Get rid of the Affordable Care Act, even though 45 million people rely on it, a couple of weeks ago, his running mate had the nerve, the chutzpah, to say that Donald Trump salvaged the Affordable Care Act.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"What: donald Trump spent his entire presidency trying to dismantle it, and he couldn't even do that right.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Thanks to John McCain, he didn't do it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And now, eight years after he was elected, after all the arguments against Obamacare have been proven to be wrong, and even folks who don't like me sure like that insurance.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"When he was asked about it, he said, well, I have a concept of a plan for how I might replace it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She has an actual plan to make her life better.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So to bring down the cost of things like groceries, she'll go after corporations that are jacking up prices, just like she went after big banks and for-profit colleges when she was Attorney General in California.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And believe me, when Kamala does, nobody is going to want to stand in her way.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I remember after the home mortgage crisis, Kamala pushed me and my administration harder than any other Attorney General in the country to make sure homeowners got a fair settlement.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She wasn't going to let anything stop her from winning as much relief as possible for the families who deserved it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's who she is, that's the kind of President Kamala Harris will be.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"To lower housing costs, Kamala is going to cut red tape and work with state and local governments, as well as the private sector, to build 3 million new homes.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Concrete plans, she'll give first-time homebuyers up to $25,000 to help them with a down payment.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala already worked with Joe Biden to take on the drug companies, bring down the cost of insulin, hearing aids, more than 50 prescription drugs.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And as President Kamala will never stop working to limit out-of-pocket costs and protect your care.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Concrete plans, that's who Kamala is.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And instead of giving more tax cuts to billionaires and people who don't need them, and raising prices on working families, Kamala is going to give a tax cut to 100 million middle-class and working people here in America.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That will help, because raising kids is hard, she wants to make it easier to afford stuff like a crib or a car seat or diapers.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
You think Donald Trump's ever changed a diaper: no.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She believes in entrepreneurship.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's who Kamala is, that's what she stands for, not concepts of a plan.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Actual plans, now, if you challenge Trump or J.D. Vance on these quote-unquote concepts, they'll fall back on one final answer.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He wants you to believe that if you let him round up whoever he wants and ship him out, all your problems will be solved.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But remember, Donald Trump was president for four years.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He likes to talk about Kamala being vice president for years.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Good job EMTs, so the question is, why didn't he actually solve the problem when he was in power, why was the number of undocumented immigrants basically the same when he left office as when he took office: i'll tell you why.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Because he didn't have a real plan, and he still doesn't.",Donald Trump,Arizona
What he had is talking points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
What he had is a concept of a plan.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He cared more about winning an election than he did to actually solve the problem.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Vote, we do not need a president who's willing to make problems worse to make his politics better.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's what Kamala Harris will do.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And to help her do it, she needs a Senate full of public servants like Ruben Gallego.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"This is the kind of person who's going to help Kamala get stuff done, folks who share our values, and will do whatever they can to move the country forward.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For Donald Trump and his cronies, freedom means that the powerful can do whatever they please.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I'm not sure any American president has ever uttered those words other than Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And it's been fascinating to watch Donald Trump just try to tie himself into a pretzel on this issue, because he sees that what his party has been doing is unpopular.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so when he ran for President the first time, he said he would support punishing women who got an abortion, punishing women.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Then a couple weeks ago, he tells women he'll be their, quote, protector.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I will tell you how he protected you, quote, unquote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He handpicked three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He bragged about it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And now there are Trump abortion bans in 20 states, many of them with no exceptions for rape and incest.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he's out there saying, well, you know, everyone wanted it this way.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Really: donald Trump may be confused, but let's be clear about what's at stake here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And meanwhile, Donald Trump and his running mate were making up stories, circulating stories about how the Biden administration was withholding aid and not giving it to Republican areas and giving it to undocumented immigrants, just making stuff up.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And yet when Donald Trump lies or cheats or bullies or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls service members like John McCain losers because they died in battle or were captured, when he calls fellow citizens Burman or the enemy within, people make excuses for it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I have to say, I've noticed this, especially with some men who think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down and acting all pretend tough guy, that somehow that's a sign of strength.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If somebody says, well, I'm thinking about voting for Trump because I remember the economy being pretty good, remind them why it was good.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If you say, well, I'm mad about higher prices, you say, well, what is exactly Donald Trump's plan for higher prices: just ask him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if they don't, you tell them he's got concepts of a plan and it don't make sense.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If they're concerned about issues like immigration, ask him, well, what do you think he's going to do: because we know what he did the first time didn't work.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if after you've gone through that and the folks who are unconvinced say, yeah, I don't know, I still like him, then you then I think you have to then say, yeah, but what about character, what about values: because that matters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Get off your coach and what, put down your phone and do what: vote for Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For my friend and your outstanding congressman, Raul Grijalva, for your next member of Congress from the 6th District, Kirsten Engel, for your outstanding next United States Senator, Reuben Galleo, and for the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris, now, before I get going, you guys have to forgive me, because let's face it, I'm a little out of practice.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He's got the Trump Bible.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Wants you to buy the word of God, Donald Trump edition.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"His name is going to be on there, embossed, right next to Luke and Mark and Matthew.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Vote, most of all, most of all, Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them, between the, quote, real Americans, by which he means his supporters, and the outsiders who don't support him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Have you seen him lately: i mean, he is out there.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's given two, two and a half hour speeches, just word salads.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He held a town hall meeting where he just, let me explain, because I've done a lot of town hall meetings.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If you think prices are high now, Donald Trump's message is, you ain't seen nothing here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Get rid of the Affordable Care Act, even though 45 million people rely on it, a couple of weeks ago, his running mate had the nerve, the hook spot, to say that Donald Trump salvaged the Affordable Care Act.",Donald Trump,Arizona
What: donald Trump spent his entire presidency trying to dismantle it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And he couldn't even do that right.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And now, eight years after he was elected, after all the arguments against Obamacare have been proven to be wrong, and even folks who don't like me sure like that insurance, when he was asked about it, he said, well, I have a concept of a plan for how I'm going to do it.",Donald Trump,Arizona

"And as President, Kamala will never stop working to limit out-of-pocket costs and protect your care.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But remember, Donald Trump was President for four years.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He likes to talk about Kamala being Vice President for years.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"All right: good job EMTs, so the question is, why didn't he actually solve the problem when he was in power, why was the number of undocumented immigrants basically the same when he left office as when he took office: i'll tell you why.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Because he figured that if you passed it, he would not be able to engage in the same kind of fear mongering that he's been doing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And to help her do it, she needs a Senate full of public servants like Reuben Ganeagle.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
This is the kind of person who's going to help Kamala get stuff done.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I will tell you how he protected you, quote-unquote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And yet when Donald Trump lies or cheats or bullies or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls service members like John McCain losers because they died in battle or were captured, when he calls fellow citizens vermin or the enemy within, people make excuses for it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Remind them why it was good.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"You say, Well, what is exactly Donald Trump's plan for higher prices: just ask him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Get off your coach and what, put down your vote and do what: vote for Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For my friend and your outstanding congressman, Raul Grijalva, for your next member of Congress from the 6th District, Kirsten Engel, for your outstanding next United States Senator, Ruben Galleo, and for the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris, now, before I get going, you guys have to forgive me.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I'm not that, and the good news is Kamala Harris is ready to do the job.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You think Donald Trump can do that, for that matter, do you think Donald Trump has ever changed the tire in his life: no.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's like having Jeeves change his tire.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"The point is, I was just picturing it, The point is, if you elect Kamala and Tim, they will not be focused on their problems, they will be focused on yours.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They understand that too many folks, not just here in Arizona, but across the country, are still struggling to pay the bills.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And all he did with it was give a tax cut to people who did not need one, and drove up the deficit in the process.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And now, eight years after he was elected, after all the arguments against Obamacare have been proven to be wrong, and even folks who don't like me sure like that insurance, when he was asked about it, he said, well, I have a concept of a plan for how I might replace it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so when he ran for president the first time, he said he would support punishing women who got an abortion.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Punishing women, then a couple weeks ago, he tells women he'll be their, quote, protector.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He handpicked three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe versus Wade.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, one of the most disturbing things about this election and Donald Trump's rise in politics is how we seem to have set aside the values that people like John McCain stood for.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If somebody says, well, I'm thinking about voting for Trump because I remember the economy being pretty good, remind him why it was good.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So this is 538 forecast right now, as you can see, Donald Trump is favored 54 out of 100 times on the national level.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, a lot of polls have definitely shown him doing well in the state.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think that, or I'm sorry, the western Sun Belt states, I think he is being overestimated in.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's about a 4,500 vote win for Donald Trump, about a 0.13% win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So I think this does give Republicans an advantage, and with the border issue being a huge advantage for Trump, I expect him to do very well in the southern part of the state, as you can see improving in places like Cochise, Santa Cruz, and Pima County, as well as improving in Yuma County and Pinal County, which he actually did improve in Yuma County in 2020 from 2016, which is interesting.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But again, this is the marginal map, so pretty good news for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It is us who will decide if Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will be the next president.,Donald Trump,Arizona
It's time to put an end to Trump's darkness.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"My friend Kamala will be a great, great, great president!",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She is tough, she has grit.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Kamala stood up to Wall Street and the DeGroote Company.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She will protect abortion access.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She will defend our freedom.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She will save lives.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Join me in voting for Kamala Harris!,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump wants a national abortion ban.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris will restore those freedoms and protect Roe v. Wade.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump wants another tax giveaway for billionaires.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he wants to implement a bunch of ridiculous tariffs that will jack up costs for Arizona families by $4,000 a year.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And just last week, he said he will torpedo our semiconductor industry here in our state, costing – that will cost Arizona tens of thousands of good-paying jobs.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is going to lower housing costs.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's going to lower the cost of prescription drugs.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she is going to cut taxes for the middle class.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Not for Donald Trump's billionaire friends, donald Trump has never served anyone except for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Kamala Harris has been a prosecutor, attorney general, a senator, and now vice president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And now she is ready to be a president for all of America.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Back in 2020, when there was controversy and when then President Trump declared that he had won the election and that there was widespread election fraud and a lot of his supporters showed up.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So does that mean a vote for Harris now, do you think: well, I mean, based on past history, it most likely does.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yes, very definitely, it has resonated with the more conservative leaning or Trump leaning voters in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"On the other hand, on the flip side, Vice President Harris, when she's questioned about immigration issues or the border, she always flips it around and talks about how there was legislation that was put together on a bipartisan basis in Congress to strengthen the border and give more money to border enforcement and so forth, and that that was torpedoed by Trump.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"On the day Vice President Kamala Harris gave her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, former President Donald Trump focused on immigration, a topic he frequently criticizes Harris for.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump visited the U.S.-Mexico border in southern Arizona and used the opportunity to attack Harris and her immigration policies, accusing her of ignoring violent crimes committed by migrants.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He criticized her role as border czar, a label Republicans use, despite the role technically belonging to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump's remarks were part of his broader campaign strategy to highlight immigration and border security issues, reflecting his previous promise to complete the border wall.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"His rhetoric continues to include strong anti-immigrant sentiments, though studies show that U.S. citizens are more likely to commit crimes than unauthorized immigrants.",Donald Trump,Arizona
There are of course no guarantees that Kamala Harris will be able to do the same this time around as we've been hearing.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris and Trump both remain locked in a dead heat.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now granted, yes, I know those numbers have drastically dropped but many voters still fear that illegal border crossings would only increase if Harris becomes president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
We know that Donald Trump and his supporters and all of the election deniers are latching on to these election fraud lies because they know that they may lose.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And so on both issues actually it's very clear that Kamala Harris is the top candidate.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
89 days to make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Both Harris and former President Trump released new ads this week talking tough, fun immigration.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are allowing illegal people to come into our country.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The White House released a new memo today, timed to the VP's visit, noting that border crossings are now lower than when Trump left office, thanks to a strict new asylum policy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But at a press conference yesterday, Trump said he would go much farther.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump's rhetoric on the issue helped prompt LULAC, the nation's oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization, to endorse Harris today.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Nationally, Harris leads Trump 52 to 47 percent among Hispanic voters.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But she's still got some ground to make up to match President Biden's performance with Hispanic voters back in 2020.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I haven't heard a clear plan why she's going to do for us, for the community.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Former President Trump is attending his first political rally all week tonight in Bozeman, Montana.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Late this afternoon, his plane diverted to Billings, Montana because of a mechanical issue.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"All right, Grace Howard from San Jose State University, thanks so much, thank you, meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about reproductive rights this week at a campaign event in Wisconsin, and she talked about the role government should or should not play.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Right: if she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her rabbi, her pastor, her imam, but it should not be the government telling her what to do.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And yet polling by CBS News shows only a third of Americans say Trump deserves the blame.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He described the job decision as a miracle.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I think Kamala Harris and her VP pick are much more hopeful and positive for everybody.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Which is I mean just obviously completely the opposite of Trump's campaign.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump doesn't have a message.,Donald Trump,Arizona
The Harris actually wants to do something for a country and I'm excited about them.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Whereas the other people they get nothing and done.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
They said and they just won or Trump just talks about himself.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Oh absolutely, harris is more positive, we're not derogatory.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Absolutely, absolutely she can take the state.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So Harris absolutely can take the state too.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I would say Trump, for sure.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I think Trump is better.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"The last time he was in, I thought the economy was a lot better.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Also this hour, new reporting on Trump's efforts to tighten his security ahead of the election and after attempts on his life.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Why: he's asking for access to travel on military aircraft with anti-missile systems instead of on his own plane.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And we begin with Donald Trump's newest efforts to win votes by spreading debunked claims about the actions of undocumented immigrants.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So Kristin, tell us about Trump's message and why he's chosen Aurora, Colorado as his backdrop.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, Alex, Aurora has really been the epicenter of this sort of disinformation campaign we have seen from the former president when it comes to immigration.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It is not a state in which he is speaking to swing voters.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's not why he's here, instead, he is here to perpetuate this rhetoric around immigration.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He has been saying for months that Aurora was taken over by Venezuelan gangs.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Alex, just take a listen to part of what Donald Trump said.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She has had them resettled beautifully into your community to prey upon innocent American citizens.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"At one point, he called our country occupied America.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He was surrounded by posters of what his team said were Venezuelan gang members or gang members that were migrants.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"The next slide said, you know, things were better under President Trump or will be better under former President Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He did announce a new policy for if he was reelected, where he said he would essentially create a federal program that would expedite the process of getting rid of deporting migrant gang members, undocumented migrant gang members.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Again, he is clearly appealing to his base here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, appealing to his base there with a very dark message.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kristen Holmes covering the Trump campaign.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Thanks very much, now, Kamala Harris has also been out campaigning in the western part of the country.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She wrapped up an event in Arizona just a short time ago.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So Eva, how is Harris talking about immigration as she campaigns on the trail: well, Alex, she mostly leans into an enforcement message when she talks about immigration.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris reiterates there was a bipartisan border enforcement bill.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And Alex, we saw the vice president today in Arizona talk about if elected, she would create a bipartisan council of advisors in effort to reach Republicans, a big country over party push from her as well.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Like Springfield, Ohio, Aurora, Colorado is at the center of this disinformation campaign about immigrants fueled by Trump and his surrogates, which even the city's Republican mayor says is not true.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, you know, what Trump did today was, again, talking about this issue in apocalyptic terms as if the entire country is overrun by immigrant gangs.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, Kamala Harris understands that this is not her best issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And instead of talking about the problem, she is trying to focus more, as Eva was saying, on the solution.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So she's focusing on it in a different way.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, she understands this isn't her best issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He prefers, it seems to me, to talk about this more than the economy, which is a better issue for him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And Maria Cardona, when you look at the polling numbers, what does it say to you that Trump is seeing some of his best ever figures with Latino voters despite this rhetoric and this disinformation on immigration: look, Alex, I think we need to level set.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump certainly has grown his support among some within the Latino community, but it certainly is not what the media and some others make it out to be.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And in fact, if you look at polling that is done by actual pollsters who know how to poll the Latino community, she is consolidating her support at two thirds of Latinos around the country and in swing states that are supporting her.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's going to do more, she's going to continue to do more.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's got to do more with Latino men.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But look, I think what's important in last night's town hall, she hit it out of the park.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"In terms of where Trump is choosing to be, Scott Jennings, you just heard Kristen Holmes talking about how blue Colorado is.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Do you think, Scott, that Trump is making a similar mistake to Hillary Clinton back in 2016 when she didn't campaign enough in the Midwest: well, I think they're crucial to the overall success of the party.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if I were Donald Trump and I thought I had a good chance to be elected president, I'd certainly like to bring along Republican majorities in both chambers, specifically in the House, which is very close.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so if Trump can help in some House races out there and help drag a couple of Republicans along with him, that's a very good thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So, no, I don't think he should be criticized for trying to do what's best for his overall party.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if he's going to have four more years in the White House, he'll have a lot easier time getting his agenda passed if he's got Republicans out there in the majorities in the Congress.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So he's picking these little wedge issues, and he knows that there's an opportunity.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Or else he wouldn't continue to repeat this dangerous rhetoric.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But what it's doing, it's not just to advance his political class.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He is putting people's lives at risk when he talks this way.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But he does see that he has the edge when it comes to immigration, unfortunately.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And what he's doing is talking to folks in communities, just trying to pull off those two to three votes per ward that decides elections in Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Gloria, Trump did campaign in Michigan yesterday.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He made some very disparaging comments about the city of Detroit.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And now the Harris campaign has released an ad about his comments as well.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so what Donald Trump doesn't understand or care to learn is that when he said, our whole country will end up being like Detroit of Sisi president, that he should be so goddamn lucky.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And of course, the Harris campaign was lightning quick and putting this ad together.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So, you know, I mean, they're they're taking advantage of it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"These are the voters that they need, including those black men in urban areas that they're not doing as well with as they'd like to do.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So facts matter, and that's why I think Donald Trump is going to be in trouble.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He did make similar comments.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Stay with me, is Donald Trump afraid that his private plane could be attacked: we'll discuss his request to fly on military aircraft in the final run up to Election Day.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Senator, yes or no, did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election: let me ask you a question.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And actually, there actually been a couple of moments when Trump himself has admitted that he lost by a whisper and then he would walk that back later.",Donald Trump,Arizona
There was also another moment where he essentially scolded black men who were hesitant about supporting Kamala Harris.,Donald Trump,Arizona
This is a real lesson for folks who are thinking about voting for Donald Trump or for whatever reason are considering not showing up for Kamala Harris as they would for somebody else.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"The reality is Donald Trump has been not just a threat, an act, in service.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He has been completely against everything that the people that I represented as a state legislator and the communities that I represented as lieutenant governor.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And with Kamala Harris and all her qualifications and achievements, it is unfortunately a little bit harder for her to make the case with just a sliver of men.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And Trump has been trying to appeal to young black men in particular in this campaign, but a peer researcher told the Philadelphia Inquirer, quote, black people under 50 are virtually no more likely to vote Republican in 2024 than they were 30 years ago.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So Scott, is this less about Trump and more about those voters staying home: well, I do think the Republicans and the Trump campaign specifically believe they are going to make inroads with a lot of men, male voters of all races, white, black, Hispanic, you name it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So if Trump can cut into some of those margins with male voters that are black or Hispanic or working class all over the country, good for him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And we've never heard Trump insult anyone either.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, he's out there calling Kamala Harris dumb and questioning her intelligence every single day.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Republican pollster Sarah Longwell did confirm that to Politico that Trump is making inroads with all male voters across the board.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"When Donald Trump came out and said, I'm going to be your protector, I think there are a lot of young women in particular who were offended by that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He did play the dad role there was saying, wait a minute, guys, take a closer look and it may work and it may not work.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Just ahead is Donald Trump's new request for access to military aircraft and other added security measures extreme or is it appropriate: i'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, host of The Chasing Life podcast.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump, of course, is facing a variety of serious threats.",Donald Trump,Arizona
There are a number of things that have already been delivered to the Trump campaign that the Secret Service has has done.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"More drones, ballistic weapons, more increased intelligence, more bodies, secret service bodies around Donald Trump and also defensive capabilities when he's speaking in public.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And those are being discussed, and then you have requests of the Trump campaign because he has an increased threat environment.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We should take that seriously, and that requires activities by the Trump campaign to respond to the increased risk environment.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He doesn't like that, he wants a bigger rally.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He wants outdoor rallies.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But in the interim, Trump has made it public.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D, vance, have been targeting these legal immigrants, spreading disinformation and threatening to deport them if they're elected.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"What on earth would possess you to vote for Trump again, are you addicted to testifying, is that it: i mean, I have to say, you're very good at it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Oh, wait, do you mean that Donald Trump: because I don't know if you know, but there are two of them, of course, that would conceivably be even worse.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Please, help me understand, please, help me understand why you would vote for Trump again after what he put you and your family through.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Remember Brad Raffensperger, the guy in Georgia, who Trump pressured to find extra votes for him: he was on the other end of this infamous phone call.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Votes, that's a terrifying moment despite the fact that Trump turns into Professor Freak at the end of that sentence.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I'll tell you who's not going to vote for Trump in 2024, Lady Ruby.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"President Trump's mistake wasn't collecting all this information, as you said, or these documents.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So just so you know, it's not like I'm here to carry his water, but as a former federal prosecutor, a couple things really struck out, stuck out at me.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Really: yes, yes, so how do we know exactly what he held, what he had, what he showed them, what he didn't show them: but remember, to be convicted, and there's 31 counts of this, Nigel.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So if I were his defense attorney, I'd be like, no, no, he was the former president.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He was authorized to have them.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so I think this is an issue that the Trump defense team is really going to have to address, because I do think this is one where they're going to have to explain what they did, why they did it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Tomorrow is a huge day for the Kamala Harris campaign.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris and her new vice presidential pick are scheduled to be in Phoenix on Friday.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Multiple sources close to the campaign tell NBC News that Harris's running mate will make their debut at a rally in Philadelphia tomorrow, and that the announcement most likely will come in a text that's sent to high-ranking Democrats, which is the same way they did it when President Biden picked Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Some local high-profile Republicans are calling on voters to make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States for a simple reason.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's not Donald Trump.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
One of the biggest reasons I'm voting for Kamala Harris and I would have voted for Joe Biden is that they are not Donald Trump.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Arizonans are rejecting Donald Trump and his failed leadership.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Another Trump term with JD Vance would be far worse and would lead our country down a path that I don't think we could ever recover from.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Mayor Giles believes that Harris will advocate for middle class Americans, make sure billionaires pay their share of taxes and secure the southern border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"All right, Troy, thank you, and meanwhile, the Trump force 47 is launching in Arizona with the grand opening of a new office in Phoenix.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Now this group is run by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I harkened back to about eight months ago in August when I did a video talking about the very real threat of another indictment for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, this doesn't necessarily name him as an indicted individual, but this is the first step.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump is now facing a fifth indictment, this time in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
People that are closest to Donald Trump related to the election of 2020 and his administration in general.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"The names of the seven Trump allies are redacted from the indictment, meaning they have not yet been served notice on these charges.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, their names are redacted but in any indictment, not in any indictment, but oftentimes in an indictment, because of the details that are listed surrounding the names of unindicted co-conspirator or individual number one or individual number two, four, six, eight.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Those individuals appear to be, or excuse me, appear to include Trump lawyers, Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, lawyers Jenna Ellis and Christina Bob, and Trump advisors Bortz Epstein and Michael Roman, now, this is big for a number of different reasons.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And Mark Meadows, the missing Mark Meadows, where's he, what's he been doing: these are questions.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Ultimately the grand jury did not hand up an indictment against Trump who had already been charged at the federal level for his efforts to upend Joe Biden's legitimate 2020 election victory by special counsel Jack Smith and in Georgia by Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis.,Donald Trump,Arizona
But the court documents provide new details about secret grand jury proceedings that led to the charges against 18 others including Trump's former attorney Rudy Giuliani and his former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows as well as insight into the decision to describe Trump in charging documents as unindicted co-conspirator one.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"The state, meaning the prosecutors, told grand jurors that indicting Trump would be a big deal and that they weren't sure if they had all the evidence to prosecute it at this moment noting such a feat could take a year or two the court filing shows.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the... Hey guys, you know what: here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest corporations and this time he will pay for it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And this time his plan is a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Clothes, food, toys, cell phones, a Trump sales tax according to the economist would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Also known as Obamacare and he has a powerful friend in Congress, the Speaker of the House, who recently said if Trump wins, there will be quote, no Obamacare.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Good morning, governor Tim Walz in Detroit meeting with black voters, senator J.D, vance also at a campaign rally in Michigan, the Trump campaign pledging prices will be lower and growth stronger if he wins.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Remember Kamala and Sleepy Joe, they broke it.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I will fix it and we'll fix it fast.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And we're going to have America that's bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's a Marxist She says things like this equity.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She says okay How much of your hard work and your money that you earn is somebody else's fair share: your money you keep it the inflation the 26% inflation That the Biden-Harris administration caused is theft It is an unfair taxation on your families, and you all feel it.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Which, let's be real, that's basically a tie at this stage.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Totally, but you know what I find really interesting: that Wall Street Journal poll, the one we just mentioned with Harris ahead, even being slightly ahead of where Biden was at the same point back in 2020, that's not nothing.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, take Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He went on that Dave Ramsey show.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Oh, yeah, the finance guy, exactly, the personal finance guru, so smart move, right: he's speaking directly to those anxieties about the economy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And he's reaching an audience that really cares about things like budgeting and saving.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But Harris, she did something completely different, didn't she: yeah, totally different vibe.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She went on that Call Her Daddy podcast.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump is sticking to his guns, going hard on that whole border security message.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But Harris, she's trying to strike a different tone.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump, he hasn't really focused on water that much.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris though, she's been talking about it.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I know there are some women that say, I don't know, I just can't vote for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
They are undermining us as parents.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Anybody who says that they should be able to counsel my child in secret is a predator.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You know Kamala Harris said just the other day in an interview that if she could do it all over again, what would she change, is there any policies or anything that she would change: immediately the list was endless in my head and she responded, no, nothing.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"How is this woman the agent of change, how do people get that understanding of who she is: let me tell you something, if you want change, vote Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I'm joyfully, genuinely excited to vote for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
The circle next to his name will not get filled in.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"There's always a chance for him to meet Jesus, but I do not know if he will have that come-to-Jesus moment.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's incredible then that you could even have Kamala Harris on your lips, so driven away from Trump that you might consider... Because you know what: he doesn't represent the Republican Party.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's not conservative, he's not stable.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I feel like Kamala, you know, where I look and say, well, you know, it seems stable.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You don't feel safe, i really don't, physically safe, why: because the level of vitriol and the level of emotion that these people that hold these seats with us have towards us for not supporting Trump, it's emotional and it's physical.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But then came the Trump-Harris head-on and that sealed the deal.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
But that debate... Was it the debate that won you over: that's what I saw of Kamala Harris that I had never knew existed.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now she's so anti-Trump, Sam even agreed to introduce the vice president on a recent trip to Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I'm excited about Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
That Harris is cleverly using to target Republican women just like them.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I really cannot say that about Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"It is the hardest presidential race I'll be voting in, even though I find him so repulsive and can't vote for him.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So, for example, one of the things that was reported today was that Mr. Trump's former President Trump's lawyer said, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Mr. Trump is very much like me, a father and a husband.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He knows better and he also knows that this is a good way, as they say, Ted, to throw the skunk in the jury box and ask him not to smell it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made before I became when I became our nominee.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She'll be a president we can all be proud of.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she will be an historic president who puts her stamp on America's future.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, she does come.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She came to the to the office of vice president with a reputation of being a fairly progressive senator.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I think that was probably fair, but I've seen her evolve over the last four years.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's had this amazing on the job experience with Joe Biden.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They've accomplished some amazing bipartisan legislation through Congress, things like the chips act, the bipartisan Infrastructure Act, the inflation reduction reduction act.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So I think she is going to govern from a centrist position.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So there's a lot of comfort to be to be found in her past record.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Why do you think that your numbers are relatively small: because in addition to being an adjudicated sexual assault or a known liar, 34 counts fell in and all the things we know about Donald Trump, he also loses a lot of elections.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He loses Republicans elections.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And as far as his character and their predictions for a total failure and the loss of the soul of the Republican Party, if they were elected, you've seen all those things come to pass.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So you can only conclude that, you know, the political price to be paid for crossing Donald Trump is the end of your.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And what that used to mean to you, donald Trump is defeated and there's a chance to rebuild the Republican Party.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The list includes Trump's fake electors, some of his closest allies, so 11 are fraudulent electors.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Even after Trump had lost all of his election cases, some of them were still pressuring their state lawmakers and the vice president Mike Pence to overturn the election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, in addition to these fake electors, there were seven Trump attorneys and aides who have also been indicted.",Donald Trump,Arizona
They're also all related to this fake electors plot.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They've all been charged with the same nine counts.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, was indicted.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And Trump campaign aide Mike Roman has also been charged.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So first is Trump attorney Christina Bob.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And then last but not least, sleazebag Trump attorney and campaign adviser Boris Epstein, he, Epstein, recently got a slap on the wrist after he had been charged for touching two women in a bar inappropriately.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"She is finally getting what's coming to her, it is long overdue.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"In June of last year, the Arizona Central News outlet reported that Christina Bob was exchanging text messages with Cyber Ninja CEO Doug Logan.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She texted back and forth with him 2000 times while his company was conducting that ridiculous audit in Maricopa County.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So as you all recall, Bob is an attorney.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She's a licensed attorney.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But during that period of time, when she was texting with him, she was a TV host for One American News Network.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And she wasn't communicating with him about stories.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"She wasn't just like, oh, getting feedback and reporting on the the election, so-called fraud it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he still, by the way, hasn't turned over all of them.",Donald Trump,Arizona
There are some that he's holding back because he claims they had nothing to do with the audit.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So Bob, in these messages, was encouraging Doug Logan to lie.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And she acted as a secret back channel to Donald Trump during all of this.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So Bob advised him, oh, don't tell anyone.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"She wrote, quote, This is a very nice, this is very nice and sincere.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Then in another text from Bob to Logan, she passed along concern directly from Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Bob said, quote, had a detailed discussion with 45 today.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So the Arizona Republic News Outlet reached out to Bob and they asked her about all of this and she said, I never told him to lie.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Bob told the outlet, quote, I may have told him not to send the letter, but that's not lying.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And then Bob helped with coordination and communication between Logan and other people involved with Trump's campaign.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And the new indictment talks about Bob taking information from Rudy Giuliani that could be used to cast doubt about the election and feeding it to the Arizona Senate president.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Bob's position as an advisor and conduit for funds allowed her access to Logan around the clock, including at the Coliseum where other reporters were restricted to the press booth and was a clear violation of that code.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He can't shut it down.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So there are some really dumb ideas that are being floated by the Republican Party and by President Trump right now.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He believes the solution here is bipartisan legislation similar to what was happening months ago in the Senate when that negotiation was underway and then kind of came to a screeching halt after the former president seemed to lobby against it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So again, he is an interesting voice here because he really highlights and represents the divide that exists within the Republican Party here in Arizona and beyond with moderate Republicans worried about the former president.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's now taking the extra step of campaigning for Vice President Harris, Juliet.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It is good to be back in event marks Kamala Harris to Arizona in her second July.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She touched on a fe abortion a little bit on about uplifting Native Am That's something that Ste governor of the Gila Riv spoken support of and thr behind Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Hi, Kamala, thank you, okay, we have work to do.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And look, we all know who Donald Trump is.",Donald Trump,Arizona
This is not – because here's the thing we all know – he is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the – hey guys, you know what: here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and the biggest corporations, and this time he will pay for it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Clothes, food, toys, cell phones, a Trump sales tax, according to The Economist, would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and he has a powerful friend in Congress, the Speaker of the House, who recently said if Trump wins, there will be, quote, no Obamacare, which would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance and take us back to the time when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And remember how we got here, donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest, which is immoral.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And Donald Trump's not done.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday: that he will do what he wants, quote, and here's where I'm going to quote, whether the women like it or not.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And this is not the first time he has told us who he is.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He will ban abortion nationwide.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He wants to put them in jail.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Only on a much greater scale than last time, and it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
For the first race we can project that Kentucky will easily go to Donald Trump for the third time in a row.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Missouri a former ball weather state that is now easily going for the Republicans gives 10 electoral votes to Donald Trump in 2024.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Going back to the south where we see Donald Trump easily winning the deep red state of Alabama.,Donald Trump,Arizona
In Maryland a deep blue state sees VP Kamala getting 10 more electoral votes in 2024 for the home state of President Biden in Delaware.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
In the Garden State of New Jersey Kamala Harris is projected to be the winner and she wins New Jersey in 2024.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Meanwhile for Connecticut in the North East we can make a projection that VP Kamala Harris gains 7 more electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Illinois too early to make a call and this could be a bad sign for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Pennsylvania where Donald Trump easily leads in this state due to the rural counties ballot dump but still too early to make a call yet.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And now for Arkansas the former home state of Bill Clinton now gives it's 6 electoral votes in a landslide for Donald J Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And back to the poll closings in North Dakota Prairie State easily gives Donald Trump 3 more electoral votes for the neighboring state of South Dakota 3 more electoral votes for Donald Trump in 2024 and for the cowboy state of Wyoming as expected the cowboy state will give Donald Trump another set of 3 electoral votes in 2024 for Louisiana we can make a projection that Donald Trump will win this state and it's 8 electoral votes.,Donald Trump,Arizona
For Kansas the sell flower state will give 6 more electoral votes to President Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
For the Switzerland of America and Colorado this liberal state will give 10 electoral votes to Kamala Harris and for a big call we can make a projection for New York where Kamala Harris wins this state 28 electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Meanwhile in Texas President Trump is running off with a lead against VP Harris in this race.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Moving on to Utah the Beehive State sees a Trump winning an additional 6 electoral votes.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Another key race alert this time in the Rust Belt where Minnesota, the home state of Kamala's VP pick Tim Woles grants 3rd ticket 10 electoral votes, meanwhile out west in the state of Idaho we can make a projection and this state will as expected go for Donald Trump in 2024.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Big race alert for Democrats as Kamala's home state of California awards Kamala Harris with 54 major electoral votes, we can also make a projection in Oregon and as expected this state will vote Democrat yet again in 2024 and for the neighboring state of Washington the Evergreen state gives 12 electoral votes to the Democrats.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
New Hampshire goes for Kamala Harris and she gets 4 key electoral votes for the North East and a big win for the Democrats in this race.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
We have a poll closing actually for the great state of Hawaii as expected this race will go in the favor of Democrats as Harris wins 4 electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
It's early Wednesday morning and Donald Trump leads with 251 electoral votes and Harris has 226 electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Breaking Vice President Kamala Harris wins and will become the 47th president succeeding Biden and for the final map for the 2024 election Kamala wins with 276 electoral votes while President Trump gets 262 electoral votes.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Joining us now, the mayor of Tempe, Arizona, Corey Woods, who is a surrogate for Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The Washington Post reports Harris tonight will aim to introduce herself, which is still largely unfamiliar with her personal story.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's been an incredible public servant during the course of her career who always has put people first.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"As pretty much all the speakers have talked about, the first thing that Kamala Harris always led with when she was a prosecutor was Kamala Harris for the people.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
That was who she was as an elected official in California.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
That's who she's been as Vice President.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And we know that that's why she's going to be elected the next president of the United States this coming November 5th.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Another finds Vice President Harris up by five.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
He's visiting the southern border.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He'll also be in your area of Glendale, Arizona, tomorrow, specifically.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But I will say, you know, it was President Biden and Vice President Harris who actually put together the toughest border security bill in recent history, which unfortunately was killed by former President Trump.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So he actually back channeled it and called congressional Republicans to get it killed.,Donald Trump,Arizona
It's more about politics and doing whatever he thought would personally benefit him.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We need the leadership of Vice President Harris as president because, frankly, she has talked about how she becomes president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That same bill that was negotiated bipartisan basis, she will sign into law.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And we know Vice President Harris is someone who also cares about results and has a proven history of getting the job done.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump's gonna win Arizona probably by five points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We'll see what happens on election day, obviously but She's still gonna lose",Donald Trump,Arizona
Now it is those millions waiting in America that have some Americans concerned and certainly has Donald Trump pushing hard with his rhetoric for much tougher rules around immigration.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"In fact he would like a mass deportation of illegal immigrants in America, many of whom have been bussed and sent around different states of America, what are known as sanctuary states.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The choices were Joe Biden and Donald Trump at that time.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Today, the choices Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, one word, how do you feel about that: better.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He says it's a Swiss watch, but nobody can actually figure out where in Switzerland was this thing made.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He wants you to buy the Word of God, Donald Trump edition.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"His name is going to be on there, embossed, right next to Luke.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Where these Bibles are made, so Mr. Tough Guy on China, except when he can make a few bucks, he's talking his Trump edition Bibles.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You think Donald Trump can do that, for that matter, do you think Donald Trump has ever changed the tire in his life: no, he's like having Jeeves change his tire.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The point is, I was just picturing it, the point is if you elect Kamala, they will not be focused on their problems, they will be focused on yours.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They understand that too many folks, not just here in Arizona but across the country, are still struggling to pay the bills.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now, some people, because I'm having conversations around the country with folks as I go campaigning, and I'll hear some people say, you know, well, I remember the economy when those first two years with Trump, they were pretty good.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If you think prices are high now, Donald Trump's message is you ain't seen nothing yet.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Concrete plans she'll give first-time homebuyers up to $25,000 to help them with a down payment.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala already worked with Joe Biden to take on the drug companies, bring down the cost of insulin.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
You think Donald Trump's ever changed his diaper: no.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Vote, we do not need a President who's willing to make problems worse to make his politics better.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And that's why you've got to vote, and to help her do it, she needs a Senate full of public servants like Reuben Geigel.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now, I will tell you how he protected you, quote, unquote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he's out there saying, well, everyone wanted it this way.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if after you've gone through that and the folks who are unconvinced say, yeah, I don't know, I still like him, then I think you have to then say, yeah, but what about character, what about values: because that matters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"18 of Donald Trump's co-conspirators were indicted on yesterday and surprisingly based on the documents that I'm seeing, Donald Trump wasn't one of those.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Harris is in the battleground state of Arizona for the first time since President Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Her visit comes as she secures a major endorsement from the League of United Latin American Citizens, the first time the civil rights group has ever endorsed a candidate.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
It's his first campaign rally this week.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"It comes after he held a press conference Thursday where he attacked Harris' record on immigration and the economy and called her, quote, incompetent.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"During that press conference, Trump also committed to three presidential debates next month.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So far Harris has only confirmed she will be at one of them.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's traveling with the Harris campaign in Phoenix, Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And campaign reporter Jake Rosen is traveling with the Trump campaign in Bozeman, Montana.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's certainly not at risk of losing that state to Harris in November.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But it's also a personal grudge that Donald Trump has against Senator John Tester, the Democrat here from Montana, who blocked an ally of Trump's Republican congressman, now Republican congressman, former White House doctor Ronnie Jackson from getting a post in 2018 leading the Department of Veterans Affairs.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He sent all of his allies up here to do so.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"It was unsuccessful, but this is the start of Donald Trump, trying to make sure that a critical Senate seat is flipped in his favor come November.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, Natalie, let's turn to the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Fixing the border is tough, so is Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And I think that ad speaks to the Harris campaign trying to push back to some of the criticism by the Trump campaign, some of their ads and language blaming Vice President Harris and the Biden administration for the current situation at the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
This ad speaks to the Harris campaign also trying to perhaps reach out to moderate Republicans or independents who are concerned about immigration and border security in this border state.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
That she is going to actually prioritize and legalize Dreamers.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I want her to actually, because we have always since I was a high school senior, I heard Barack Obama talking about my first 100 days, I'm going to get a bill of immigration or I'm going to introduce the Dream Act.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Well, Jake, besides the Friday rally and a press conference Thursday, Trump has been somewhat absent from the campaign trail compared to his opponent.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Why is that, does he have more campaign events planned: well, this is certainly the longest time that Donald Trump has gone without an official campaign event since Butler and the RNC in which he's had an event every two or three days.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So certainly it's a little bit of a downtime, but we did see Donald Trump do some interviews Friday into Monday remotely.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And he also sat down with livestreamer Aiden Ross.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But as we kind of get going towards the DNC and while Vice President Harris and Tim Walz are going to get a lot of attention, we can certainly expect Donald Trump to try to vie for that with a number of rallies and counterprogramming that week.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, Natalie, how is the Harris campaign boosting its presence in the Southwest swing states, what kind of voters are they courting there: yeah, well, number one, they're taking the campaign here physically.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
The campaign says that they've opened around 13 offices in Nevada where she's traveling to tomorrow and around a dozen here in Arizona.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They say with more to come, so this really speaks to the campaign putting heavy emphasis on these key states in the Southwest.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Nearly 63 million Americans have already voted and with the polls razor thin, Kamala Harris needs all the votes she can to become president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She also promoted access to health care, saying it fitted her belief and dignity for all people.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala Harris says she's fighting for the future, describing it as a fight for freedom.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Kamala Harris has a chance.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"With five days to go, before election day, Kamala Harris describes Donald Trump's campaign as one of hate and division.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He insults Latinos, scapegoats, immigrants, and it's not just what he says, it's what he will do.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
That all you have to do is listen to Mr. Trump and believe me what he says he will do.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And I think that Vice President Harris is obviously best equipped to do that.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's proven herself and we're super excited to get her over the finish line in November.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Everything he says out of his mouth is just negative.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I want to make one thing clear at the start because there's a few Republicans for Harris groups.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Make the case for Republicans who might be thinking about voting for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala Harris, I believe, fits all of those.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Okay, do you, when you hear, or did you listen to Kamala Harris's acceptance speech: you've heard her speak in other venues.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But what I appreciate about her is that I know she is, she has a great track record of following the rule of law and the Constitution and continuing our democracy.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So that would give me a great pause, is that Trump would still be controlling the party.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So is that really the breaking point for you, do you see a day after Trump, after Trump leaves the scene, when you might come back to the Republican Party if it's refashioned: i'm not sure, actually, at this point.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Worst news, especially if your name is Donald J. Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yes, Trump is especially screwed by this decision.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She is the best candidate.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now, Harris chose Tim Walz for VP.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He has a progressive record as the Governor of Minnesota.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She declined to pick your Senator Mark Kelly or Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, arguably more moderate options.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You say that you want politics to return to the middle, but is her vice presidential pick pulling her away from the middle: i don't think so.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Donald Trump was not a good president from the perspective of a mayor and he was, did not interact well with cities.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Regarding the southern border, Harris, when she ran for president back in 2020, she said specifically that she believed that illegal immigration, rather, should be decriminalized.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's since kind of walked back those comments, but she hasn't really sat for any major interviews.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She takes a couple of questions from the press every now and then.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Should she be clarifying her positions: i mean clearly you're comfortable supporting her even though her past positions in immigration seem to run extremely counter to what you believe.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Well, it is important that she speak on that issue, particularly folks like myself in border states are anxious for her to flesh out her positions on that, but I can tell you that she has been very clear on supporting the bipartisan infrastructure act that was negotiated by Senator Langford and Senator Sinema and others and really had the approval of the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, the White House, until it was scuttled by Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's already said that if she's successful, she will endorse that plan and work to see it implemented.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So she does, has announced a good policy when it comes to border security issues and immigration reform.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Donald Trump has been critical of that plan, but has offered nothing as an alternative.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The latest AP NORC found that more Americans trust Donald Trump on immigration than Kamala Harris.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Is she not getting her messaging out there enough or I mean, is Trump not being clear enough on his messaging: i'm curious where that divide comes from.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yeah, well, Trump has done a better job of messaging and his message is nothing but criticism of the current administration without offering up an alternative plan.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The alternative plan that was presented was the bipartisan plan that was negotiated by Republican and Democratic senators and met with both parties approval until Mr. Trump decided that he didn't want to have a solution at the border because he didn't want the Biden administration to have any credit for that.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And it's very much a wedge issue, an emotional issue that can be used for his personal political gain during the campaign.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And Vice President Harris has indicated a willingness to do that by indicating her support for the bipartisan immigration act that is just waiting on the sidelines, waiting for a president to come in that will be able to sign it and a Congress that will approve it.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"... ... Officially, one week to go till the big day, and Kamala's latest strategy is to pretend Trump will take your guns and your free speech.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"No, seriously, she thinks we're dumb.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He wants to terminate the Constitution of the United States.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala said she won't take your guns.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But Kamala also alleges she will protect your free speech rights, which is not only laughable, given the Biden-Harris administration actively worked and is still working to curtail those rights.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But also given how her running mate, Tim Wols, feels about the absoluteness of free speech.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Kamala is actually much better at talking in salads.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Well, why did he get rid of the Constitution when he was the president: because it doesn't exist.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump is not this crazy old man is going to somehow unravel the foundation of this country.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I would certainly hope so, it's so funny because Kamala was caught on a hot mic.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But when she was with Big Gretsch and they were talking about how they're losing with men, they conveniently didn't notice that there were microphones all around.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That seems to be the all in play there, but I think she's going to lose majorly with men.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump is so radical.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So I think people are waking up more so than what it has to do with Kamala Harris independently.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, she comes across very disingenuous.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's not a genuine person.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's not authentic when she gets out there and says she could collagreens in a bathtub.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And it's very questionable what her ethnicity really is.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
We don't know how black she really supposed to be.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So she whipped that one out, we would actually believe it.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But speaking of AOC, you know, there's still the hysteria over Trump selling out Madison Square Garden.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's a dictator.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's going to ruin America.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's Hitler.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's going to make this a big deal.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's going to make the economy better.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's not that serious, donald Trump left office.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He left, they finished the vote the same day.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The man relinquished his position as the president and Biden is the president.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Some people are going to lose it all when Trump wins and they're going to lose it all for nothing over fake rhetoric over political jargon, just so Democrats can stay in the power.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But then on the flip side of that, when you see a Trump rally, you look at Madison Square Garden.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But by all accounts, everybody that was there, everybody that's gone to a Trump rally, people are kind.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, you just don't see this kind of stuff at a Trump rally.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, I honestly think Donald Trump dominated, but he still end up not getting the electoral college votes from the state of Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It was incredible, you see so many Trump signs, so many Trump flags everywhere in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"This is Trump country, how the heck he didn't win this place by a loan shot was bizarre to me in 2020, but his success is growing even greater.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But I would hope that people would say I'm voting for Donald Trump, so I'm going to vote for Carrie Lake and I'm going to vote for the Republicans down ticket.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I really hope that the people will wake up because if you look at the polling, the polling match how I feel and how others are feeling because Donald Trump is dominating.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Nobody can do what Trump does.,Donald Trump,Arizona
But how do you think this is looking a week out: i personally think he's looking great for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I think that Donald Trump is going to win this thing by a lot.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I think they're doing horrible.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They got to pay ten million dollars allegedly to Beyonce for her to do a three minute speech.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump just sold out Madison Square Garden.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump's momentum is out of control.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And the more that Kamala goes on television and she just word salad her way through it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She don't answer questions.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She can't tell you what she's going to do.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She telling she is a new way forward.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's already in office.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
But I think Donald Trump is going to kick butt this time.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Elon Musk have endorsed Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump went on Joe Rogan.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And it's the podcast probably 50 million views right now.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I mean Donald Trump has gone all these other podcasts that are more cultural and not just political podcast.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I mean he got shot.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Joe Rogan thing too because it came out today the podcast put out that Kamala said she would do the Joe Rogan podcast.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
But on her terms they want them to come to her and it can only be an hour.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump did the podcast humanized him to millions of people that have never even thought about listening to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And then you got Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I want to see what she has to say.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she turned it down and then they go back and say oh now she's accepting it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
But she won't Joe Rogan to somehow fly somewhere instead of a podcast where Joe Rogan has never done that for any day.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And then Donald Trump did three hours and he could have did six hours.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Y'all know how he talked, i mean I watched the whole thing and I was like God dang this is pretty interesting.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Kamala want to do that, people are like oh dang I thought she was like gunning for this thing.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I thought she was like confident.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I thought she was confident enough to run the country.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's not even confident enough to do a podcast.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And Kamala Harris hasn't done a good job at that.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's cackling and laughing and can't answer questions.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's seeing a timid.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's not confident, she's looking down every time she interviews.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's not a good representation of a female leadership position or a female leader.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And I think it's going to hurt her more than what the polls are showing.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
But a lot of men are like if I'm going to have a woman lead me she needs to be a woman that I can believe that I can follow.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"My mama, and she don't represent mama vibes.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She don't represent grandma vibes.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That would have been far better leaders, it would have been far more confident against Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And be very confident, kamala Harris has none of these qualities.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"None at all, and I think it's going to hurt her.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Can you just imagine her representing our country: she's trying to eke out right now.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You know she's got to be in the to myself, imagine we elect her and she's got to do this for four years representing us.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Like, what is the world going to look like if this woman is our president: not because she's a woman, but because she's Kamala.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala Harris and her minions are saying, you're wrong not to pick her a woman because she's black.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Wait a minute, she married a white man.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So she don't even support black men.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She married a white man.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And then out of all the running mates, she could have picked.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She picked a corny white man.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She didn't pick a black man.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She didn't pick a black woman.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She didn't marry a black man.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She married a white man and picked a white running mate.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she don't even do that in her professional life running for vice president.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I think she'll get more of the black vote if she did say, I'm gonna pick a woman to be a vice president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Tommy, why not, why can't it be two women on a ticket, why can't she pick another woman: if it's women power strong, I think she'd get more credence if she picked a woman because then you'd be like, I ain't women.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So I don't know if I look at Tim Wols, I'm like, yeah, she picked a white man from the Midwest.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But I think that Donald Trump is gonna win this thing pretty big.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So I hope that me and you after the election have a celebration conversation about how Trump swept her in this election and we can finally get our country back right.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Appreciate you as always, all right, folks, Donald Trump and the increasingly haunting realization that he will be reelected has broken the collective liberal brain and I just hope that their networks cover therapy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The lib media fixtures have abandoned trying to polish the turd that is Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So instead they decided to go full bore TDS.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They were just desperate to characterize Trump's Madison Square Garden rally as a gathering of Nazis.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"TDS, Trump derangement syndrome, isn't a disorder based on reality, but rather on delusion.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think a lot of people are seeing that rally at Madison Square Garden, seeing all those people doesn't mean he's going to win the race.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"All of you, he's talking about you.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's not going to be, he's not going to, you know, say, oh, you're with a white guy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"No, he's going to deport you and put the white guy with someone else.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Not only does calling Trump Hitler endanger his life, one that has hung in the balance at least twice in the last four months, but the way they're speaking about his supporters also puts us in danger by calling the MSG rally of thousands a Nazi rally or by alleging baselessly and disgustingly that Trump will put people in camps.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"This is not new, of course, we remember Maxine Waters calling for Trump supporters to be targeted and driven out of public spaces after the victory in 2016.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I've personally been physically assaulted for my outspoken support of Donald Trump, but I fear this go around will be worse.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If you're a Trump supporter, be proud of it, but keep your head on a swivel because this is no joke.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"How's it looking now: jeff, this year polls show that Trump has a slight edge over Harris in the state.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"How many of you have voted for Donald Trump, how many of you voted for Donald Trump twice, and how many of you plan on supporting Donald Trump this November: none of you.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And 23-year-old Kevin Winkler is a retired pastor who voted for Donald Trump in 2016.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And because decisions in the presidency, especially, are made by the character of the president making them, Donald Trump does not know how to tell the truth.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He deliberately lies, and then he lies about his lies.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He never voted for Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, 2016, during that campaign, he mocked a disabled person.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I look at his economic policy, and he's basically talking about a huge national sales tax without any kind of approval from Congress.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And basically, at his whim, and he's looking at anywhere from 20 percent up to 60 percent of tariffs.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It's not even like he's talking like a Republican.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's talking command and control economy at this point.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's not even giving us a choice.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And Joel John, 45, voted for Trump in 2020, but feels he's no longer able to support the former president.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I know that Trump isn't my choice, and I am still watching and waiting and very hopeful as Vice President Harris keeps moving to the center.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think by and large, Kamala Harris is a decent person.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I think she's going to protect the rule of law, follow our constitutional process.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If she loses the election, she's not going to claim it was rigged.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris would enforce the law.,Kamala Harris,Arizona

"These hate groups, particularly, I guess Hispanics, which is what Trump and his gang are really pushing hard on.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I want to point out that with Trump and his hate groups, just because you've been living here for 400 years, your family's been here for 400 years, as many of those in the Southwest have, or you're blonde and blue eyed, like many immigrants are, particularly some of many from Cuba.",Donald Trump,Arizona

He's getting in the way of their agenda.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"While that's the same size lead he had over Biden in May, things have changed.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So what has changed: it's a three-point difference between the Democrat and Donald Trump, but stuff has changed.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So for example, back in May, Trump led independents by 10 points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Harris now has a five-point lead with that group.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris is up 12, and then 18 to 34 year olds, Trump had a two-point edge.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Now it's Harris plus 11.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So whether you look at our poll, which shows Trump with a slight edge in Arizona, all the polls have it either, you know, I didn't worry, upward to Harris plus five or Trump plus five.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Because remember, Biden only beat Trump in Arizona by just 11,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I realize that this this poll was taken before the DNC and, you know, RFK Jr. dropping out all these other things.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But Kamala Harris had a bump going into her convention.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so Harris had kind of had this momentum leading into this kind of this honeymoon phase, irregardless.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And these campaigns hunker in because that's the other thing the polling showed is that, you know, with on the issues, Trump is doing better on some of the key issues that Arizona voters care most about, such as his pocketbook issues and immigration.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, Harris does better on issues such as like abortion, or issues of, you know, integrity or character.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"However, former President Trump is a little more brazen in his comments and his plans.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Of course, he's promising the largest mass deportation in American history, promising to go after people have a final order of removal and those criminals first.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Meanwhile, Vice President Harris, she talks about the border security plans and passing that Senate bill.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But she says that the border was secure for four years.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So she's going to have to convince the American people that she is going to be tougher on the border when millions poured across it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If Donald Trump wins in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Leading Donald Trump in both states by two points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Talk to me about Kamala Harris's message there and how it's doing.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, obviously she's trying to kind of capitalize on the border issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
This is something that Donald Trump has very much made kind of the cornerstone of his campaigns since he's been running for president.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so if she's able to kind of deflect some of Trump's criticism on that, it could bear fruit in the campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And you've seen as we saw in that video of the Harris walls rally tonight here in Glendale.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Does the Harris walls ticket benefit from that crossover vote: most likely.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Today's video is on the state of Arizona, an absolutely critical swing state in this election very important to both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris' pathway to victory.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"As of the day I'm recording this video, the 2024 head to head national vote polling average has Harris over Trump by 1.8% which looking at the past three elections that would be the lowest popular vote win for a Democrat out of any of the last three elections which could certainly spell some potential trouble for Harris's chances of winning the election because you would think, well Harris is winning the popular vote, she'll get more votes nationwide, doesn't that mean she would win the election and the way the electoral college system works is it actually does not.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If Harris only wins the popular vote by 1.8% this time and Arizona once again votes 4.1% to the right of the popular vote, that would give Trump enough to win the state by a little over 2% of the vote.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Let's say Trump only wins, or Arizona excuse me, only votes 2% to the right of the popular vote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Well Trump would then win the state by 0.2% if the numbers remained the same.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So this is why it's very very important that for Harris's chances of winning she needs to have a higher popular vote margin than what Hillary Clinton got in 2016 where she lost the election very very narrowly because of Republicans because of Trump outperforming the national vote in several states percentage wise.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
If Trump is going to win the state of Arizona he either needs to do way better everywhere else like drastically better and keep Maricopa County at 2.2 or Trump needs to get this number at 2.2% slightly smaller than what it is.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump can win the state of Arizona without winning Maricopa County but if Harris expands on Biden's 2.2% in Maricopa County and everything else throughout the state of Arizona remains equal I'm having a hard time finding a way for Trump to get enough votes to win the state of Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So Trump's number one target has to be Maricopa County in Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Harris's number one target has to be defending Maricopa County and trying to grow on what Biden was able to do in 2020.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Now looking at Arizona county map statewide in 2020 Biden got 49.4% of the vote Trump got 49.1% again very very close Maricopa County narrowly flipped flipped blue at 50.3 to 48.1 super super close can't underscore this enough 2024 this is the county I'm watching for every single second that I'm watching on Arizona I'm watching Maricopa County Yuma County right down here 52.3 for Trump 46.1 for Biden Navajo County right here 53.4 to 45.2 Pima County 58.6 to 39.9 this is one I am watching as well for Harris.,Donald Trump,Arizona
2016 Trump wins the state of Arizona excuse me 48.7 45.1 and look Maricopa County goes red 47.7 44.3 a three point margin of victory in Maricopa and about a 3.6 margin of victory in the state of Arizona again I think Maricopa County goes may very well be how the state of Arizona goes Yuma 47.5 46.4 Navajo 51.1 40.9 and Pima finally 53.3 39.7 looking at 2012 Obama Romney this is a much bigger and by gone era honestly in Arizona where it's a nine point win for Romney over Obama 53.7 44.6 Maricopa was over 10 points in 2012 win for Romney Yuma 55.7 43.1 for Obama 53.3 to 45.4 and 52.7 45.7 I mean as much as I'm sure Trump would love to see a 2012 Obama Romney map 2020 is certain I think somewhere between 2020 and 2016 is what we're mostly looking at I wouldn't be shocked if every county stays the exact same from 2020 and 2024 but Maricopa County a hundred percent is the county I'm watching for does it stay blue and if it does what's the percentage does it flip red and what is the percentage that is what's going to decide how the state of Arizona goes on election night now looking at the party percentages for both Republicans and Democrats in 2020 Trump got 49.1% the vote lost a very close election 2016 Trump got 48.7% of the vote won a very close election in 2012 Romney got 53.7% and won the state when you look at 2024 the estimated range based on these numbers of the highest minus the lowest and taking the range of that added to the highest and lowest numbers a low point of Arizona Republicans at 43.7 a high of 58.7 and the average vote across the last three elections a 50.5% a range this close from 43.7 58.7 certainly shows that it is a very winnable race on both the Republican side and you're about to see on the Democratic side easily Republicans can win or lose Arizona depending on how the night goes very very close on the Democratic side very similar 2020 Biden got 49.4 2016 45.1 for Clinton and 2012 44.6 for Obama a low end of 39.8 on the range to a high of 54.2 kind of similar numbers for the Republicans very very winnable for both Republicans and Democrats in Arizona an average vote across last three elections of 46.4 so when you're looking at it the average vote across the last three elections does favor the Republicans the most recent election 2020 of Trump vs Biden when you look at just that one alone you would think okay that favors the Democrats then the estimated range very very narrowly favors the Republicans even though it's pretty much the same when you look at what the numbers are the Democrats are slightly lower Republicans are slightly higher but it's not by a huge margin it's very very close in that respect so you have to look at the polling data and that's super close only half of 1% of the vote separating Harrison Trump in the average Arizona is going to be very very close on election night and it's a state that can really go either way but in my prediction for the state of Arizona I have Donald Trump outperforming the polls slightly in the state and winning by 2% of the vote statewide this is one where I think the polls will just be a little bit off on election day in Arizona not by a huge margin only about 1.5% of the vote I think they'll be off by which is not a huge number when you look at polls considering the variance of maybe a hidden Trump vote that we saw in 2016 and 2020 I do have Trump winning the state of Arizona but not in a blowout not like a 2012 Obama Romney and not even as big of a win as 16 Trump vs Clinton I think the in between numbers of 2020 and 2016 somewhere in between that is where Trump and Harris end up and I think Trump wins the state of Arizona but given how close this election is if Harris won the state I won't lie I would not be totally shocked I do think Trump is favored to win the state right now that's why I'm making this prediction but it's gonna be a very very close state on election night and right now on the 2024 electoral map Kamala Harris is 81 electoral votes Donald Trump is up to 37 Harris started out with a big lead when I started with Washington Oregon California and Hawaii Trump has Alaska Idaho Montana Wyoming Utah Nevada and Arizona Trump was slowly starting to inch his way back up to Harris is 81 electoral votes and catch up however depending on which state comes next in the deep dive series maybe Trump's trend continues maybe it doesn't maybe Harris picks up some more electoral votes you'll have to tune in the next video to find out which state I'll be doing next but I really hope you will because hopefully you enjoyed this series because I'm having a lot of fun doing it and I hope you're having a lot of fun watching it so that'll do it for the deep dive today in the state of Arizona thank you so much

Texas Wisconsin and Wyoming now let's take a look at what projections we can make at this time starting with the state of Arizona and it's 11 electoral votes we can call this race as too close to call

"Yes, he is running for Arizona Secretary of State, where he would be in charge of the state's elections.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And yes, he has the full and complete endorsement of Donald J. Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Elaine Godfrey was at Trump's rally this weekend, reporting on it for the Atlantic, where she described the event as the soft launch of Trump's second campaign and Tess Owen is a senior reporter at Vice News, where she's been covering right-wing extremism.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Give me a sense of the atmosphere at Trump's crazy rally.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And many people rallying behind Trump's election lies are conspiracy theorists like Vinchem, who have ties or even official members of extremist groups like the Oath Keepers.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris holds a slight edge in Arizona, leading Trump by a mere 1 percent, while Trump mirrors this narrow lead in Nevada.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris's gains have come largely from women, Latino voters, and younger voters, groups she has specifically targeted in her campaign efforts.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Men, on the other hand, remain one of Trump's most reliable voting blocks in both Arizona and Nevada.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"His messaging on economic strength, law and order, and conservative values resonates with male voters who view him as a champion of traditional American ideals.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump's support among older voters, particularly those without a college education, also gives him an advantage in Nevada, where he is led in rural areas and smaller towns.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Although Trump maintains a loyal Latino following, particularly among those who prioritize economic growth and conservative values, the poll captures the impact of early voting, which has been underway in both states, though with some differences.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Early turnout shows an edge for registered Republicans in both states, suggesting that Trump's voter base may be particularly motivated to participate ahead of Election Day.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, Harris's lead among early voters in Arizona, 53 percent support her, while 44 percent back Trump suggests that Democrats are also turning out in significant numbers, possibly reflecting the state's competitive environment.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris leads with 53 percent compared to Trump's 44 percent.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"This may be due to Harris's appeal among demographics more likely to vote early, such as women, younger voters, and Latino voters, who often prefer the convenience of mail-in ballots or early voting.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump holds a 52 percent lead among early voters, while Harris captures 46 percent.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Both Trump and Harris have tailored their messages and strategies to resonate with the diverse electorates of Arizona and Nevada.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump's campaign has focused on themes like economic recovery, national security, and border control, issues he believes are critical for his base in these states.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"His rallies in rural areas and smaller cities are aimed at galvanizing male voters, conservatives, and working-class communities who support his vision.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris's campaign, on the other hand, has concentrated on appealing to women, young voters, and Latino communities through a platform centered on healthcare access, education, and social equity.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She has emphasized her commitment to policies that address inequality, environmental protection, and affordable healthcare, key issues for voters in both states, her outreach efforts, particularly through community events and targeted ads, aim to rally support among the diverse population in urban and suburban areas.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Should Harris win Arizona and Trump take Nevada, it could signal a split in voter sentiment that will be mirrored in other swing states.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Also, Donald Trump just seems very unwell.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He was making noises throughout the night, just making weird noises while instead of even speaking here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Come on, then Donald Trump said that he believes there are murderers and drug dealers in the audience right now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, seriously, folks, this is what Donald Trump's doing right now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"How unhinged, how demented he continues talking about Adam Schiff.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He goes shifty, shift, shifty, shift.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Then he starts talking about Hillary Clinton and IQ.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Then Donald Trump continues to start talking about how the elections being stolen from him in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's getting a lot of bad data this evening, which we've been telling you about here as we've been reporting with the best analyst in the business and Donald Trump's freaking out about the data.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Then Donald Trump talks about a certain pastor who says that he's great.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I didn't know what he's talking about.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And he was a big supporter and now I have unbelievable evangelical and Christian support because I have.,Donald Trump,Arizona
What what then Donald Trump hears an airplane believes it's an F-35 and then says look at me.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Watch this, did you see his right leg there: you see again, those are signs and symptoms of mini strokes.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"In my opinion, there's a reason why he's not releasing his medical records.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Anyway, contrast that to Vice President Kamala Harris this evening in Las Vegas where she mocks Donald Trump about his teeny tiny crowds.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Play the clip, you may have seen I talked in Washington DC the other day, you know, he likes to compare crowd sizes.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And finally you have Jennifer Lopez giving a speech as well in Las Vegas this evening with Vice President Kamala Harris condemning Donald Trump for his awful statements that his campaigns made about the Puerto Rican community and her saying all Donald Trump wants to do is divide us.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Vice President Harris says she is not losing momentum in the race for the White House with just a week until election day.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Alright if that's the case Trump's at 252.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Under that scenario he would not have to win Georgia.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He could go up to Pennsylvania and capture the 19 electoral votes that would put him at 271.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Harris aides quietly grow more bullish on defeating Trump.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Is that spin or do they believe it: well they better believe it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Nonetheless okay and look I mean Trump's not going to the door 246 still this blue wall was still up there right so if she holds on in Wisconsin which historically is a really close state by the way we're going to show that on election night and if she holds on to Michigan and holds on to Pennsylvania and then picks up that electoral vote in in Omaha she can win despite the strength of Trump in Nevada Arizona North Carolina and even Georgia I mean that would be something a week from tonight Karl.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I think she made a big mistake by engaging on the issue of John Kelly's comments about Donald Trump being a fascist.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She basically spent two days talking about that and that's not a winning issue for her.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Everybody who already thinks that or who will be who will be touched by that is already in her camp.,Donald Trump,Arizona
The problem she's got is that she's been a presidential candidate for less than three months and the American people are saying do I know enough about you to feel comfortable putting you in the Oval Office behind the resolute desk for the next four years.,Donald Trump,Arizona
She made a mistake if the campaign really does believe that they've made a big step forward by emphasizing the fascist comment.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump has been calling her a fascist for weeks so now he's whining saying she's calling me a fascist.,Donald Trump,Arizona
What do you think that is the trend for as far as these two states: i think it looks to me and has been for the last couple of weeks that they lean towards a Harris vote.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They've had to be escorted out by police officers or by law enforcement as they've come to their cars when they come to the end of their shift.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"In a lengthy post on social media, Trump wrote, there will be no third debate.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's simply, this news coming shortly after Harris arrived in North Carolina for a pair of events in our state.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And after Kamala Harris wraps up her remarks in Charlotte, she'll then head here.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
The Harris campaign says the two stops in North Carolina today are part of a battleground tour being called a new way forward.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"One who's voting for the very first time, another who believes Harris needs to lay out who she is as a candidate and some of her policies more clearly.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Equal pay and, exactly, do you think and feel she needs to clarify more on what matters: i think she needs to clarify her policy on immigration more and her policy on health care more because I don't think she's really laid that out correctly.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
The WRL news poll showing Harris with a three point lead over Trump.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
The poll conducted by Survey USA had Harris with 49 percent and Trump 46 percent.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So Harris is expected to make remarks here around 650 in Greensboro.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
The Texas Tribune has Harris ahead 49 percent to 48 percent.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But here's the kicker, harris is support.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's gaining ground in the suburbs.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But why Harris specifically in Texas, is it something she's doing, something in the air down there: so the Texas Tribune poll, they actually dig into this a little bit.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"One, her stance on economic recovery seems to be hitting home with middle class families, especially with all the ups and downs we've been having lately.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Plus her focus on health care, making it more affordable.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Biden barely snatched in 2020, emory University has Harris not just holding on, but actually up by three points now.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"What's fueling her in the Peach State: black voter turnout, it's through the roof.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And Harris talking about voting rights.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Like when we're talking about immigration reform, climate change, making health care affordable, Harris, she's got plans and people seem to be responding.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He was not able to do so, and look where he is at.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That doesn't mean that he is a part of, I think a mainstream or pro democracy wing of the Republican party here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He hasn't endorsed in the US Senate race.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump lost the state by just about 10,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And the challenge, though, is that it's really hard to have a plan when, as President Biden has said, with 50 senators, with 50 Democratic senators, every single one of them is a president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Christians will not be safe with Kamala Harris as president of the United States.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump rallied with faith leaders in North Carolina last night, claiming without evidence the Justice Department labels Catholics as potential domestic terrorists.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris yesterday with three stomps in three battleground states, do we want a president of the United States who spends full time plotting revenge while they sit in the Oval Office or a president who is actually focused on the American people: harris in Michigan campaigning alongside former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, who made this pitch to conservative voters.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And they just could not relate to them.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But since Kamala Harris has become the candidate, they are all in.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"In fact, they said that we always go as a family and make it into an event and go and vote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So they're all in, the entire family is going to be voting for Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So we knocked at the door and there was no one home.,Donald Trump,Arizona
We were about to head out when the neighbor saw us and he came to check what was going on because he was watching his neighbor's house that we were knocking the door on.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So we shared with him.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And definitely voting Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
We'll be doing this again next week.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, the Trump campaign was the exactly that's okay.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But the Trump campaign was indeed the first ones to announce that they were planning on, you know, announcing this lawsuit alleging voter fraud.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And the other one says I was working as a ballot observer for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Is the Trump campaign considering legal action in Arizona: well, to be clear in Arizona as well, the Trump campaign has already been granted a motion to intervene in a state case over this Sharpie Gate conspiracy theory, as has the local Democratic Party here in the state of Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Bram And tram this is the week when voters start paying attention On the Democratic side the Harris walls campaigns get out the vote efforts started this past weekend with visits by Hollywood celebrities On Tuesday second gentleman Doug Emhoff will attend three events including a Republicans for Harris gathering on Wednesday the vice presidential nominees hit Phoenix Democrat Tim walls will appear at two closed events in the valley walls will then fly to a Tucson rally Republican JD Vance is speaking at a Mesa Church and on Friday Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is expected to appear in the valley time and place to be announced No word yet on any events or Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump Mark Bram a lot has been made about the Latino vote and I just read a new poll that saw showed that Kamala Harris is losing young male Latino voters How crucial is it for her to be able to sway: undecided Latinos to join her with early voting getting underway.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So that's a big challenge For Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She needs to win all the core democratic voter groups in addition to 10 to 15 percent of Republicans in Arizona in order to take the state that's because of Republicans general turnout advantage in general elections Bram I know another big debate that we will all be watching is coming up this Wednesday evening It's the US Senate debate between Reuben, Gallego and Kerry Lake.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I well, I still feel like Trump's going to do better.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Just based off recent events, his polls are skyrocketing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And I think he's just already secured the presidency.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And we've already seen those anti attack Kamala Harris ads here on the airwaves in Phoenix.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"There's a new campaign, there's a new person, presumably at the top of the ticket, assuming Kamala Harris is able to do as she said, earn and win the Democratic nomination.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I imagine you'll see big fundraising numbers, not just on the official side with the Harris campaign and with Democrats up and down the ballot, but you'll also see it in outside groups who are going to be helping to define Republicans and helping to boost up and have the back of Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump has long said he believes he can win New York even though he lost the state in the last two elections by more than 20 percentage points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"During her rally in the Peach State, Harris also brought out Samuel L. Jackson's Spike Lee.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris is hoping the added star power will help galvanize voters with a Marist poll showing her tied with former President Donald Trump in Georgia.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris is heavily favored to win New York, the Empire State.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yeah this maybe you're right I can't imagine that people that that are asking to and will be going to the Harris rally right tomorrow Just hate Joe, but like I don't Not hate or even well, I'm just I'm just here because it's not Joe Biden No, I think they're there because it's her but are you excited about her or you excited, because Biden's not in the race and you really don't care who else it is You just want you want a live person who can actually speak: or or as we said now, I think this is getting a little out of hand.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's for sure No, and to be honest in 2015 Donald Trump Donald Trump had a he had blue collar people a billionaire had blue collar people coming out and he found a way To speak to them and and get through to them And so I don't you think she's speaking to and getting through to a different group that I can't like they haven't been talked I can't put my finger on what I'm just saying I just think it's odd and and it's never ever happened where someone's asked.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"No, she hasn't been impressive in three years And she does seem to have trouble with speaking Extemporaneously, right: i mean right and I'm not denying the fact that right now At this very second.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Mm-hmm, she's lightning in a bottle.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
It's one different thing It's very interesting to watch and if you're watching Donald Trump Donald Trump doesn't know what to do He's got no idea what to do.,Donald Trump,Arizona

"Hold on, he doesn't know what to do He said he heard bad things about Kamala Harris while in a helicopter crash With Willie Brown a hard land helicopter crash really: willie Brown just put out a statement.",Donald Trump,Arizona

Donald Trump obviously keen to block her and he is being well successful to date.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
He is ahead slightly in the polls although it's margin of error stuff and you can tell just how much both candidates want to win this state because they're both coming here on the night of Halloween to hold rallies and campaign events.,Donald Trump,Arizona

And Harris supporters here we talked to say they know Arizona is really an important state.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For the first time, why did you vote early this year: honestly, because Donald Trump told me to.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He keeps saying it and I've been thinking about it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so here I am, there's no better answer than that, right: because Donald Trump told me to.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So he is voting here in 2024, we met three other voters, one that moved from California, one that moved from Oregon, blue states who said that they moved here and were eager to vote in a state where Donald difference.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"For those of you who haven't been paying attention, you know, at Trump's rallies, he has been making it a point to tell everyone, get out and vote early, get out and vote early.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And he's been strongly suggesting and promoting to do mail in ballots as well.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Mail in ballot requests are down significantly from 2020, particularly in the coveted swing states that Kamala Harris needs to win.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
It's looking like this time around that is not going to be the case for Kamala Harris as it pertains to mail in ballots and early voting.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Once again, in between this concerning independent voters and now looking at the ground game of Donald Trump as it pertains to him being able to energize his base to get out and vote early.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You see that this is working, mSNBC couldn't find a Kamala Harris voter in sight in Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And once again, as I keep stating more, I keep stating over and over again in this video, this truly does spell disaster for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so Harris, as I said, had an 18-point advantage with Latinos.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris is plus one with Latinos in Nevada in our poll, but according to the 2020 exit polls, Biden won them by 26 percentage points.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris winning women by 16 points.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump men by 14 points in Arizona, women are going for Harris by five points in Nevada.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's a potential pool and pot of voters for Kamala Harris to be talking to.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You see, Harris has a lead on that category, an upper single-digit lead.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
That's the exact argument she says she will do and that Trump does not.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's winning those, but not overwhelmingly, by five points in Arizona, by two points that she wins that category in Nevada.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump has a single-digit lead in both those categories in both states.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala has it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She has it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's honest.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's not a felon, you know, once again.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Now it's Vice President Harris trying to fight through people here.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
But there is a significant amount of support and energy for Donald Trump that I wasn't necessarily expecting.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's the issue for the Trump campaign right now.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Who supports Trump and Gallego at the same time.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And one Trump supporter said he believed Trump's claims that he actually won in 2020 was false claims.,Donald Trump,Arizona
But he didn't buy similar claims from Kerry Lake in her last election.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So Bram how many understand why Trump would be more popular with Republicans than Kerry Lake in her state: it's a really really good question.,Donald Trump,Arizona
What we hear from voters is basically there's only one Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"How much longer can Harris ignore this crisis: chris Clem, retired border patrol chief agent in Yuma, Arizona, is here to react.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I was reading a report by another border chief who was saying the name Kamala Harris actually elicits eye rolls out of border patrol agents and border law enforcement, because everything has just gotten worse since she became the quote, Borders Are.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The fact that she's been to a border state, or she is currently in a border state, and not actually going to the physical border and meeting with her own border patrol leadership or border area law enforcement, is adding insult to injury.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And in Arizona, Trump has as many as three and a half point lead.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Hello guys and welcome to today's video, today we will be charting Trump's amazing surge during the past month in this video.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Based on the 11 most recent polls taken over the past three weeks, Trump currently leads Harris by an average of 1.1%, Trump at 48.4% while Harris at 47.3%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"For instance, in 2020, the polls understated Trump by precisely 2.3% while Biden prevailed by just 0.3% compared to the 2.6% lead he possessed in the polling average entering election day.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It is no longer under consideration for Trump and the Republican Party, which is shown by our just one poll here since President Biden withdrew from the race.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Hence, adding 1.8% to Harris' margin yields a Harris plus 12.8 final result more than sufficient to place Colorado in the safe blue column here on our map.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"With Trump holding 50.3% of Harris' 44.2% based on the last six polls, the polling average right now shows Trump leading Harris by 6.1%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump's great lead here is not surprising given Florida's recent election cycle's sharp rightward turn.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Nevertheless, Trump ended up winning by 3.4%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Adjusting for historical polling error, Trump's present six-point lead over Harris in the real clear average increases to 8.5%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump underperformed in many other states, yet he was only underappreciated in Georgia, roughly a point.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Making that little change to the present polling average turns Trump's lead from 0.5% to 1%, so preserving Georgia's tilt Republican column.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Without current polling, based on Trump's 2020 margin of plus eight, we will classify Iowa as most likely Republican.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"This includes six to seven point underestimations of Trump in both 2016 and 2020, so reinforcing its likely Republican status on our map.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Averaged out, Harris leads by 11.6%, against Biden's nine point triumph in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But in 2024, Trump has lately led in the polling average by 0.9%, with 48.5% to Harris's 47.6% based on the past 10 polls.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"For Harris, this change especially worries since she had regularly led Trump by one to two points since she became the Democratic nominee.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Applying that 1.7% polling error to Trump's present margin, his lead rises to 2.6%, hence shifting Michigan into the lean Republican classification on our map.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris's road to success depends on Michigan, since it is typically expected of left of Rust Belt neighbors, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Losing all three would definitely cut Harris's route to 270 electoral votes off course.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Starting two states west, our next state is Minnesota, where real clear polling has Harris leading in her running mate Tim Walz's home state by 4.7% on average over the last four polls, ranging from Harris plus three to Harris plus six, from 49% to 44.3%.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala Harris's lead falls to 2.7% now, with a two-point change to the poll average.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Should we change Trump's slim lead in line with historical bias, the outcome turns to a meager Harris lead of 0.4%, still within the margin of error.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris leads Trump by 7.4%, according to the most recent average from actual clear polling, a little increase on Biden's margin from 2020.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The error was same in 2016 and 2020, undervaluing Trump by 3.8% in both cycles.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now moving to North Carolina, where the actual clear polling average shows Trump with a meager 0.5% lead.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Polling Harris's 48.2% at 48.7% 11 polls total make up this average.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Trump leads in 7, Harris leads in 1, and 3 show a tie.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Although all of these polls have margin of error, the only one displaying Harris in the lead comes from less credible pollster, Atlas Intel.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Correcting for 2.5% historical polling error, Trump's lead rises from 0.5% to precisely 3%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Based on average of the most recent seven polls by real clear polling, Trump leads by 7.4%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Fascinatingly, Trump has led exactly six points in each of the last three polls, which would imply a minor underperformance relative to his eight-point winning margin in both 2016 and 2020.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump leads with 237, just barely ahead of Harris's 219, leaving 82 votes still up for grabs with just four states left and neither candidate yet scoring 270 electoral votes.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Real clear polling claims that Trump currently leads by 0.3%, having a vote share of 48.3% to Harris's 48%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump has led in seven of the past 12 polls, marking the first steady lead he has maintained in Pennsylvania for some time.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Pennsylvanian polls historically have understated Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Hillary Clinton led by 4.1% in the polls, leading up election day in 2016, but Trump turned out victorious by 0.7%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Making this change, Trump's lead increases to 2.5%, classifying Pennsylvania as a lean Republican.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Real clear polling finds Trump leads by 5.7%, almost exactly to his 5.6% victory in 2016, driven mostly by a 4.5-point underestimating of Trump in 2020.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Making this change, Trump's lead in Texas rises to 7.6%, transforming our map from lean to likely Republican.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"With two states to go now, Trump rises above the 270 mark and earns 296 electoral votes, so guaranteeing his victory.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Misses in 2016 and 2020 fall within two points, after adjusting for the weighted error, Harris's lead just slightly rises from 6.4% to 6.5%, considering the rather small polling errors.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
The Badger state's actual clear polling average shows Kamala Harris trailing Donald Trump by a shockingly narrow 0.3%.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris has led since late July, same as in Michigan and Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She hasn't quite lost her edge here yet.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It is highest here, harris's slim lead is entirely flipped by applying that 4.3-point adjustment into a Trump advantage of four points.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And compare that even to 2016 where Trump won Arizona, he won it by four points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If Trump really wins Arizona by eight points, which I'm not saying for sure he will, but if he wins Arizona by eight points, do you really think Harris is the pathway, do you really think that Harris is going to win the presidency: because if she's losing Arizona by eight points, she's a deep trouble in Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She's done the Sunbelt.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I just don't see how Trump wins Arizona by this much, but by some miracle loses North Carolina.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Outside of that, every other pollster except two, which is Bloomberg and Atlas Intel, which we'll get to that in a second, every other pollster has Trump winning Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And it's not just the polls have Trump up by just one point.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"No, no, the majority of the polls have Trump winning Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So when you factor in what data orbital found, which was Trump plus eight, you're talking about four polls right now that has Trump up by three or more in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump plus three and a half, yeah, we have Trump plus three, Trump plus four out of Arizona from, from Atlas Intel, which most people would agree is one of the best pollsters out there.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So that means you have five polls right now that has Trump winning Arizona by at least three points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"We're not talking about one Trump poll and that said, no, that's five separate polls, including the New York times, insider advantage, CBS news.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"In fact, on the average right now, it's only one poll or actually two that found Harris mysteriously winning Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
The only polls that have her winning are either outdated or they come from CNN.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Literally every other pollster has Trump up in Arizona by two, three, even five to eight points as of now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump is going to win Arizona if the election was held today.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And at the very last second, you had polls decide to show Trump up by four points and he won by three and a half.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's actually winning Arizona by four to five points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So it's crazy to suggest that Trump is not going to just win Arizona, but he's going to win it by like three to four points, which I'm not even saying it's going to for sure happen.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You have a bunch of polls showing Trump up by three, four, five, seven points in Arizona right now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But polls are not the only things suggesting that Trump's going to win Arizona by quite a bit.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"If it gets so bad for Democrats, there's a legitimate possibility that Trump could win Arizona by some crazy margin like Trump plus four, Trump plus five, which I'm not saying it's going to happen.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And I really believe that's the margin of victory Trump needs to have for Carrie Lake to barely win.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But if Trump really wins Arizona by five, six, seven, eight points, which that's what data orbital is suggesting.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But if the trends continue and Trump actually wins Arizona by four points, you're talking about 50, 50 race.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If it's Trump plus five, Carrie Lake is probably the favorite.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I still think Ruben Gallego is the favorite, but it's a different story of Trump is really winning by three, four, five points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's why I thought Trump needed to win by for Carrie Lake to barely win by like three to five points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
But it comes as Trump is facing controversy over connections to conspiracy theories.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"When asked for comment, the Trump campaign did not address Loomer simply saying his participation in the 9-11 ceremony was not about anyone other than the souls who are no longer with us.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And the Republican governor of Ohio, a Trump ally, is pushing back on baseless conspiracy theories amplified by Trump in the debate about immigrants.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Urging Trump to stay focused on issues like the economy and protecting the border.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think the more he can stick to those issues, I think the better off that he is going to be as he goes forward.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris is hoping to capitalize on her strong debate performance, even as some undecided voters say they want to know more about her plans, including how she'd address immigration in the economy.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
That is higher than the 51 million who watched Trump and Biden square off in June.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is coming back to North Carolina today.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Jeff Harris is expected to hold two rallies in the state today.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's set to speak in Charlotte around 3.40, then Greensboro at 6.50.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
The Harris team is calling this the New Way Forward Tour.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"A campaign official tells NBC News her team is entering a new, more aggressive phase.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Since Harris became the presumptive nominee, another campaign official said more than 20,000 new volunteers have signed up.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
WRL's Laura Levine will have live coverage of Harris' visit later tonight.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Noah, meantime, former President Donald Trump is set to make his second trip to southern Arizona in less than 30 days.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But before he could appear in Tucson a second time, his campaign had to make a deposit of $145,000 up front.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That required deposit came about because he failed to pay an $81,000 bill from a campaign event at the Tucson Convention Center from 2016.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump is scheduled to begin speaking at 5 p.m. More time.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Secretary Hobbs, who is Andy Biggs and does he speak for tell me who he speaks for in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, I think unfortunately he's speaking for a lot of the Republicans in Arizona, but certainly not for the majority of voters in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It'll be a big event though because there is an expectation that some 40,000 people will be there Also today relating to Kamala Harris a bit of an oopsie moment She was caught on a hot hot mic from a couple of days ago complaining about her inability to woo male voters Oh Kenny the old hot mic so as I mentioned we are broadcasting live from Nogales in southern Arizona this morning.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
You could practically smell her desperation coming from a mile away.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I don't care what kind of poll you managed to look up on Google, it's pretty obvious what she's trying to do in Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Because if she had any inkling of care about the border, aside from trying to scrounge around for votes, she would have visited the border a hell of a lot sooner than what she did recently.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"There's about five other major things she's handling, but I've asked her the VP today because she's the most qualified person to do it to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that help us, we're gonna need help in stemming the movement of so many folks stemming the migration to our southern border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But you want to know what the best part about all this desperation is: it's not how obvious it is what she's trying to do, or the fact that Arizona is currently swinging in Trump's favor, it's the fact that most people in Arizona fully understand what it is she's trying to do.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You see, that wasn't the number of points in which Donald Trump was leading Kakamala Harris, it was the percentage of voters who trusted Donald Trump to do a better job on immigration and the border, which is where that 15% lead is.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Like I said at the beginning, if Kakamala Harris wasn't desperate for voters, there's no way she would have visited the border recently.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And let's also keep in mind that according to Fox News, the sheriff of Cochise County, that being Mark Daniels, has been trying to get her to the border for three and a half years now.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He apparently has connections with the governor of Arizona, and he's been doing his best to get Kakamala Harris over there, just to see what the border looks like.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And he stated that although he's glad that she's finally visiting the border, why did it take this long to do it: well it's quite simple really, it's because Kakamala Harris has no value and she doesn't support anything that she says.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And you know what's funny about this is that apparently she's trying to introduce a bill that quote-unquote fixes the border problem.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She complains that Donald Trump and the Republican Party keep shooting down her bill, but let's not kid ourselves, the very moment that bill is introduced and is passed, we are screwed.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump got 600 K. So the Democrat firewall was 1.4 million vote advantage going into election day.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But considering when you look at the 2020 figures where Trump gets 600 K in 2020, Biden gets 2 million, that's 1.4.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump right now is investing a ton in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I really, if Trump was able to stretch a victory, a margin of victory in Pennsylvania by three and a half McCormick wouldn't be able to get, you know, get pushed over the finish line by like a point, a point and a half or something like that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But if you get that margin, now you're talking about the Senate race is getting a lot better in the rust belt for Republicans, even though Wisconsin is potentially in play if Trump can win it by two and a half to three.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's another state where Trump wins by eight and a half, nine and a half, kind of like he won in 2020 or 2016.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump is winning it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's not going to end up winning the early vote in Clark County.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So for Trump right now, and then obviously you look at all the betting and everything like that and in the Atlas Intel poll, and now we're really talking about the popular vote being a potential Trump victory as well to the point where I might have to predict a Trump popular vote victory.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But the reason that is is because of the massive shift in the liberal States where Trump's going to cut into the margin significantly.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And that's why you see a Morris with a, you know, just pathetic, horrible poll that has Harris plus five.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Um, so I really hope five 38 has ends up having Harris win because imagine they actually do go with Trump and they're like, we got it right.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yeah, i mean, Trump's doing very well, but it is very early voting there.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If you get a plus eight Republican electorate advantage, cause it was plus four and Trump barely lost.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But you can sense that there is real potential ground to be tilled here for the Harris campaign.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
The Harris campaign knows it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And I think had a very positive, just both personal experience and vibe as far as like getting people in that state excited, you know, to to vote for Kamala Harris, including a bunch of former Republicans, and there's a strong Senate candidate in that state that like very much appeals to these Nikki Haley, bulwark type voters and Alyssa Slotkin, who's like a strong national security Democrat.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yeah, and so I want to talk about exactly that, because, you know, look, it's not often that Kamala Harris is going to bring like a special guest with her on the campaign trail.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Obviously, somebody that she's going to do that with is going to have outsized importance.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so can you talk about her decision to basically start doing events here with Liz Cheney, what that signifies, and the power that Liz Cheney is able to kind of use in order to sway some of these disaffected Republicans: well, I think it signifies, number one, that the Harris campaign recognizes the importance of this demographic.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she continues to grow her vote share among Nikki Haley voters.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And so I think that explains why she's out there today.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"On Monday, she's doing three stops, one in Chester County, Pennsylvania, that was moderated by my Bullard colleague Sarah Longwell.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Then she goes on to Michigan, then to Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And the thing that she does that I think is the most impressive, and I think it's helped her a lot as far as gaining from where Biden was, is she can, she can talk about the progressive issues that she cares about, right, at this event, she still talked about how we need home healthcare for seniors and reproductive rights and healthcare, you know what I mean: like healthcare, a lot of these traditional progressive issues, but on a values level, on themes, talking about how America needs to play a strong role in the world, and how the government should be efficient and how she wants to work in a bipartisan manner to get things done.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's very comfortable in that environment.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Like you could, you know, you could tell when people are faking that, you know, and she's very much not.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And I just think that Kamala Harris wants to make sure she gets every single one of those, like votes.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And I think that's a good kind of target demo for her to kind of squeeze out a couple more votes as we're looking at a really close race.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Tim, you know, critics will will look at Liz Cheney going going on the campaign trail with Kamala and say and basically say, look, look, she didn't even have enough of a constituency to stay in the house.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's a winner, i give Kamala gets 20% of the Republicans in Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's the next president and, you know, we can all like send Donald Trump back to the Cougar Den at Mar-a-Lago or maybe even to jail.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Like if she can, as many of those voters, she can pull over huge plus for Kamala.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so I just, again, like I said, to me, Kamala seems to be really on from an issue standpoint, talking about all of the issues that she was already talking about that she, and she's really appealing to this demo just thematically and through a commitment to rule of law and the constitution and character.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so I, it's not like she's sacrificing anything, you know, on her left flank to kind of bring these people in.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Having these people, you know, basically start the conversation with Democrats like Kamala Harris will give a permission structure for a lot of these Republican voters out there to know that it is okay to like kind of like as a gateway to, it is okay to vote for Democrats and the policies that Democrats are espoused are not going to lead to the end of the world.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so when you, when you break that, like, you know, if, if, if Kamala and Liz Cheney being together can get some people to break out of that mindset, it does, you know, create an openness to rethinking certain issues and being more open to like the progressive point of view on certain issues.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"There is a community of people who recognize that, that you don't just have to pull the lever for Donald Trump because you've done so in the past and that there are other people out there who recognize the importance of electing Kamala Harris, even despite longstanding party identity.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Anthony Dewitt still feels like Trump is significantly stronger on economic policy.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Great, and you know, in the four years that Kamala Harris has been the vice president United States, it hasn't gotten much better when the moderators pushed Trump on his tariff proposal.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump boasting that his three Supreme Court justice picks helped overturn Roe v Wade, giving states the decision on how to handle abortion access, something that panelists Melissa Narves, who is expecting her third child, feels strongly against.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Um, there's nothing there's nothing new other than you know, he's shifted his stance now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris meantime stating if Congress brought forward a national bill on abortion access, she would quote, proudly sign it into law.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Carlos Guadarrama, a second generation american whose father is from Mexico doesn't approve of Harris's action or what he considers lack thereof on stopping illegal immigration.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
His statements causing tension to erupt.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Some panelists like Nicole Kepke say Harris's lack of specifics solidified their vote for Trump.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
What's her plan: i know what he did.,Donald Trump,Arizona
What's she gonna do while others like Nathaniel word say Harris was the only one who came across as a leader on stage cementing his vote for her.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So Kamala Harris is slated to be here this afternoon around 2 or 3 o'clock.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She'll be here at Cochise College in Douglas.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
They've kept detention at a minimum.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
They have leaned heavily on parole programs as legal pathways and they've provided millions of federal funding to volunteer groups.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"When pressed on the millions of migrants who have poured across the southern border under this administration or the lack of vetting that's happening in the processing, Vice President Harris points to the failed bipartisan border bill.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now Marnie, you heard from Sheriff Daniels there who has been extending the invitation to Vice President Harris for three and a half years.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Now he has not had a single conversation with President Biden or Vice President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But Kamala Harris is debuting a new ad today talking about border security, talking about that she's going to enforce the law.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's going to secure the border, different things like that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And she is expected to really kind of press on President Donald Trump about how he was the reason that the border bill that she calls is a solution, that it failed.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Now she's also expected to talk about fighting the flow of fentanyl and getting additional screening machines for the ports of entry and things like that to double down on preventing that deadly drug from getting into the nation.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now when it comes to what her and President Biden have done with the border crisis, we know that President Biden ultimately in June finally signed an executive action to crack down on these asylum seekers and these people who are crossing the southern border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But what do we need to know, are you seeing momentum shifting in Trump's favor: yeah, you know, I don't know that I'd say it's shifting in his favor.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And we do see that Trump is ahead by one in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin, and then ahead by two in North Carolina.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She is really going to have to pull it out first in early voting and then hope that the election day turnout is in her favor.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So there's a larger margin of error here, but we see that Harris is ahead by about 68%.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Again, not the best science for Harris, she wants to run up the score in that early vote.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"We see that Harris is up in that early vote 60 to 40, but it's a little bit too early to tell.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
That divide isn't quite what Harris would want it to be though.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump is winning men more so than she is winning women.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So in all three states, Trump wins men by double digit margins.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's not true for Harris among women where she's really in that high single digits.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"However, as long as those men are voting for Trump and the numbers that they are, then she really has to run up that score among female voters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She needs to run up that score if she's going to remain competitive here.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I think that some factors that might play into the lag among women and her comparative slight weakness to Biden in 2020, we look at the top issues, the economy to some degree in these states, immigration, but a little bit less so.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So it's likely that folks are tying her to the Biden administration.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She is a vice president, so rightfully so.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But otherwise, there's very little to point to as far as why she's not getting more sizable margins among women and why she's losing a little bit of ground among men.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris has done a good job of capitalizing on that housing affordability issue.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's maybe let off the pedal a little bit there, but that's a significant issue, especially to voters under the age of roughly 40 who are maybe in the market to buy a house, can't necessarily afford a house, and are seeing rising rents as well.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
We have seen that Trump overwhelmingly wins folks who say that the economy is their top issue.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And then when you factor in housing affordability, Vice President Harris overwhelmingly wins those folks.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"We've seen that Trump overwhelmingly, not necessarily overwhelmingly, but winning white voters in these swing states.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But Harris doing well among African American voters were especially important in places like North Carolina, doing well among Hispanics, not necessarily at the same margins that Biden won these voters in 2020, however, according to exit polling.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So she is tracking a little bit behind what Biden was able to do in 2020.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And age, we are actually seeing that younger voters are supporting Harris by a little bit higher numbers than we necessarily expected given Biden's performance in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's not equal across these states, but we do see that she's doing well among the 18 to 29 demographic.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"How significant do you think it is that 8 percent of the Trump voters right now plan to support the Democrat Josh Stein for the gubernatorial race, and what does that suggest about party loyalty at large in the state, given Trump's voters ability to disconnect the down ballot races with the presidency: yeah, that's a great question.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So, you know, I think that it is a potentially good sign for Harris here that Josh Stein has mounted a significant lead over Robinson.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So there could be some significant crossing the aisle here by Trump voters to support Stein or perhaps skip the gubernatorial ballot entirely.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But whether that boosts Harris, I'm not sure.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It doesn't hurt, that's for sure, but I expect there to be a pretty sizable difference between the presidential ballot and the gubernatorial ballot in North Carolina.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I think that we've seen this throughout the election that some of these Republican candidates can't perform as well as Trump at the top of the ticket.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So, you know, any sort of defection that Harris gets from some of these minority voters, that's really going to hurt her on election day.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She cannot afford to lose these votes even if she makes up a little bit in the white vote.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Vice President Kamala Harris will continue to undermine her record on Friday, this time on the issue of immigration during remarks in Douglas, Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris faces a conundrum.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She cannot campaign on policies to fix crime, inflation, and border security without undermining the Biden-Harris administration's policies.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But she must tout the administration's policies to validate her record and candidacy.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"In a blow to Harris, President Joe Biden stated Wednesday that he delegated everything as commander-in-chief to Harris, including foreign policy and domestic policy.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Under the Biden-Harris administration, migrants swamped the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris will visit the southern border invasion after Fox News polling on Thursday found more Arizona voters 15 points trust former President Donald Trump over Harris to handle the crisis.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"During her visit, Harris will try to improve her polling numbers by undermining her record by acknowledging the Biden-knowledgeing the Paris administration did not properly secure the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Political playbook outlined Harris' revised ideas.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris will argue that American sovereignty requires setting rules at the border and enforcing them.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She'll call for more resources for Border Patrol agents to do their jobs.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She'll propose new detection machines for fentanyl at border entry ports.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She'll reject the false choice between securing the border and creating an immigration system that is safe, orderly, and humane.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She'll decry Trump's failures as president to address this challenge and his recent efforts to kill bipartisan solutions to it, and say that the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
More on Harris' scant plan to secure the border is here.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
It is not clear if Harris will take any questions while in Arizona.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She has held no press conferences since she entered the race in July when asked about specific policy solutions to secure the southern border during last Thursday's interview with Oprah Winfrey.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris ignored the question, rambling off 441 words in about three minutes.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
The establishment media raised concerns about Harris' repeated attempts to avoid her record.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Concerning immigration, for example, on Monday Harris IDs refused to tell Axios if she still supports Amnesty for 2 million illegal aliens, or so-called dreamers brought into the nation as children.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He held a press conference in light of Kamala Harris's trip down to Arizona today.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And then after that on X, he posted just a bullet point of what he plans to do when it comes to the southern border.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If he becomes president, stop all migrant flights, shut down all entries through the migrant phone app and catch and release restore remain in Mexico, bring back title 42.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If he does accomplish all of those things, what happens to the southern border crossing numbers: the numbers are going to go down.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's what he did last time that he was running for office.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Notice how on his bullet points he doesn't say he's getting rid of asylum claims.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Because you know what: he does care and he understands that there's some people that have viable asylum claims.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"If you give if Harris wins the blue wall, the famed blue wall, you can see, boom, 270.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She gets there, now, take it out and let's see if Trump won the blue wall, which he did in 2016.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
You would see the math add up and he doesn't quite get there.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's going to need more add in a North Carolina.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He gets there, add in a Georgia.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He gets there, now, I do want to take you back to one thing, though, and that is Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, the blue wall.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But it is a strategy that Trump has of North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"In that Sunbelt, if he can get that, all he needs to do is to pick off one of the famed blue wall.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But President Trump has lots of unfinished business there.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So I was saying, Biden, last time, Trump has.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's where Trump won in 2020 by about 75 K votes.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, Trump is there a lot, which suggests maybe he's not totally confident about it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, what President Trump says where it's going to be too big to rig is very real.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"President Trump, he took a bullet for us.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Th for saying what I can't s Joe Biden beat Trump by f in 2020.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He then references a conversation in November 2020 in which he claims that you told him that the election was rigged and that he had won Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"To quote the former president, during the conversation, he told me the election was rigged and that I won Arizona, unquote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Mr. Bowers, I understand that after the election, and I don't know whether this is the conversation the former president is referring to, but after the election, you received a phone call from President Trump and Rudy Giuliani, in which they discussed the result of the presidential election in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The president interrupted and said, give the man what he needs, Rudy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He said, I will.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Get subscribed to this channel right now, you'd have to be a complete imbecile to believe that Trump organized any effort to overthrow the US government or former rebellion or interfere in proceedings.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But that one day, which is a terrible day, Trump shouldn't have had that day because he shouldn't have realized that there's a double standard in American politics and anything he does, they're going to try to sabotage.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's not an insurrection, but what Trump did was you have billions upon billions of property damage that summer.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Okay, they weren't supporters of Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And yet Trump is being thrown off the ballot because of one day where he did not tell anyone to commit a crime, but you did have democratic politicians say, get in people's faces.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's up to like three and a half.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's going to be up four points, 5.6 points soon.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's so popular and they're interfering, not only interfering, it's such a blatant attempt at trying to go after their political opponent with the stupidest, most arrogant, vapid, overtly partisan and political stunt.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"If 91 charges, he's still up.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the — hey guys, you know what: here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump and his loyalists in the Republican Party are as laser-focused as they ever have been on subverting future elections to regain power as they demonstrated yet again at another deranged rally in Arizona over the weekend.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Of course, all of these outrageous bad faith misrepresentations of what Dr. King said are happening as Republicans led by Trump are actively engaged in attempts to suppress votes and subvert future elections.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's now been over a year since Trump unleashed a violent mob on the Capitol with rioters who waved, among other things, Confederate flags.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And we know that not only did Trump sick that mob on the Capitol, he gleefully watched them on TV as they tried to overthrow democracy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he refused to do anything about it, as even his closest allies privately pleaded with his chief of staff to put a stop to the riot.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And yet Trump is still walking around, lumbering into arena rallies in the oversized coat and red hat like a mobster who has to umpire a little league baseball game to fix the score.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump is still free somehow, despite multiple investigations into his business and political activity, including his attempt to shake down the Georgia Secretary of State to, quote, find enough votes for him to win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's also remarkable how Trump has driven everyone so insane, they're becoming more and more like their fictional characters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So Trump is still walking free despite what you would think is overwhelming evidence of his guilt, including the fact that he fomented a violent insurrection to overturn an election that resulted last week in seditious conspiracy charges against some of the key militia figures involved.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"For example, at Trump's rally over the weekend, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell claimed he had invented a new form of paper for future elections that was somehow even more secure than the paper we have now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The coup attempt Trump and his gang of authoritarian dopes started shortly after the November 2020 election is ongoing.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Opinion Donald Trump might have Taylor Swift kicked his chance to win Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Let's begin, not long after Taylor Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for President Donald Trump went online and, channeling his fifth-grade self, which is essentially no different than his 78-year-old self, posted, I hate Taylor Swift.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump and the members of his MAJ cult then derisively dismissed all things Taylor Swift.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Even Republicans think endorsement helped Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump was first at 38%.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Kamala, shouldn't be running, she shouldn't even be running.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She didn't get any votes.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
What Kamala and her radical left cronies have done to the state of Arizona is a crime that can never be forgiven.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
What they've done to us and what they've done to us on the border can never be forgiven.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For four straight years, she's imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons all over the world.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she's resettled them into your communities to prey upon innocent American people.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If Kamala gets four more years, the entire country will be turned into a migrant camp.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Right: one of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country is the savage Venezuelan prison gang known as Trenday Aragua.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And clearly, former President Trump believes that immigration, he keeps hammering Vice President Harris on immigration.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"One quote from the beginning, he says they come from prisons and jails, a saint asylum, mental institutions from Venezuela, from the Congo all over.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So what are your thoughts so far: well, I mean, you said that they're coming from dungeons all over the world.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And look, I mean, this is kind of par for the course for the Trump campaign.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And one of the things that I point out, Phil, is that his campaign has actually rolled out policy today, specific immigration policy today.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But a senior Trump advisor talked about how, you know, if elected president, he will plan to hire 10,000 new Border Patrol agents.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, he was just about to double that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It sounded like when they were playing that video, he was doubling doubling down on on some of those those false claims made out of Aurora, Colorado.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But clearly that's something that he personally has identified that works with with these supporters.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so that's that's why he's going there, all right.",Donald Trump,Arizona
You have both VP Harris and former President Trump making appearances here in the Valley.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"VP Harris needs to sort of concentrate on mobilizing her voters, especially in the West Valley.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so she's going to have to focus on those, getting her vote out.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And clearly, she's going to go with an uplifting message, a uniting message, and try and get those people motivated and mobilized.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump's going to the West Valley already.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's going to be in Glendale.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But all he needs to do is just try not to make any controversial, if you will, headlines walking into this.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So certainly, you know, the Harris campaign is going to want to mobilize women going into this.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And certainly, you know, the Trump campaign is going to want to mobilize men.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"How is likability of former President Trump and Harris playing into people's decisions this time around: i mean, we needed a computer to tell us that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, we do have some very good news out of the state of Virginia for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He didn't, a lot of his supporters did day of.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He told them not to do the early vote.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"There a lot of them are going to go to the polls this year day of, although Trump still is going to win day of vote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And then everyone thought Harris would pick Shapiro.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I'm honestly not sure exactly why Harris keeps going up, though, because I think Trump's gotten a few great days of polling recently, especially from New York Times in specific.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But listen, it is what it is when you when you've got these models and you factor in these liberal pollsters and have Harris up by five or six in Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But as long as Trump keeps this close, I'm really not worried about that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He can talk to Zelensky.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, then why is he meeting with Trump: i think Zelensky knows that Trump is very likely going to win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We all know that right now, some diehard Trump supporters are auditing the ballots from, uh, Maricopa County in the state of Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It's only going to embarrass Donald Trump more.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I will never be a Republican, but if I were her, I might look at this data and then think twice about hitching my wagon to Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Because she was the vice president in Biden's administration.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
So it's very less likely that Kamala can get a vote from those sending their children to schools.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And with Trump as the Republican nominee, they are feeling confidence in having high wages for the blue collar workers.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"There seem to be confident that with Trump as their president, there will be tight immigration policies, which will result into a sharp decline of the crime rate and more jobs for the Arizona Arizonans.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The last three and a half years have been brutal, what do you think about Kamala Harris: i don't know if I should comment on that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's now 2.6 percentage points behind Donald Trump.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I spoke to many Trump supporters who said that the border issue was actually their main issue.,Donald Trump,Arizona
This will be my third time voting for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump, i'm going to vote for Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
People don't like him because he's brash.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Who cares: he runs the country.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's who we need, look, Trump has his quirks.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump has a lot of issues that I wouldn't prefer, but policies is where I go down.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So I gather from this, you are a Kamala Harris fan.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Big time, she's been able to completely turn a quote, quote, sinking ship into back on track.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
There was also the anti-Trump factor simply not liking the sort of character who Donald Trump is.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Like she can't do the job, you know: four months ago when I went to the headquarters, it wasn't just Dwayne and four old ladies.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump will take to Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona
That was Donald Trump in June when it felt like every poll was trending in his direction.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Harris has consolidated the Democratic base.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's got 96 percent of Democrats with her, and that's on the back of an increase in enthusiasm among Democrats, more Democrats saying that they're likely to vote, that they're going to turn out.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris doing better among black voters than Joe Biden was, a core part of the constituency, so movement there, as well as increased enthusiasm and saying that they're going to turn out.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Shelby, what do you know: yeah, so she confirmed that she's looking forward to debating Donald Trump on September 10th, which is that ABC debate that was previously scheduled and then Donald Trump sort of pushed back on it once Joe Biden dropped out of the race.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So now that seems to be on once again, from my understanding, that is the only official debate out of the three that Donald Trump had earlier announced that has been confirmed.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She tweeted about that September 10th debate.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yeah, there it is, donald, I hear that Donald Trump has finally committed to debating me on September 10th.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"All right, those are the words from Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, this was the demographic that Trump was going after through much of the race.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, the energy at these Kamala Harris rallies is the closest thing I saw would have been Bernie Sanders back in 16.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"This has been a truncated campaign, so while there is momentum, they have less they have less distance to cover, right: very, a lot easier.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The press conference today from Trump trying to push her into a corner saying, why aren't you out there doing interviews: the speed, it's hard to overstate just how important the messaging over the last five years against Biden was successful.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So, Shelby, you have new reporting on J.D. Vance and those accusations he's made against walls as military career.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he really, he was the first person I think on Trump's campaign to officially like loudly make this into a big deal.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He argued that it was stolen valor.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He argued that Tim Walz has inflated his military record.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he also spoke to me about other things about Tim Walz, about his political record, about whether he is pro-family or not, and his sort of history in his own home state.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he argued to me that there are things that he agrees with him on, like, like, you know, feeding kids in schools, but ultimately some of the other more progressive measures that Tim Walz has taken is dangerous, essentially, to America.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Anything he pointed out in particular about those family values: yeah, so he, well, one of the big things was the transgender bills that Tim Walz has signed into law.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Today, Donald Trump is falsely claiming that this ban goes too far in his view.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now, we will tell you what he says about policy and you will decide whether to vote and who to vote for.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But I have to tell you that that claim is false because he already put three justices on the Supreme Court who created this reality.,Donald Trump,Arizona
This is the exact reality that he not only supported but used his power to create.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"It was elections and politics that got you those Trump judges because some people in 16 looked up and said, what's the big difference: or they had issues with Hillary Clinton.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's pretty odd for something that every Republican president in the modern era has pushed for with a strict anti-Roe v. Wade litmus test for every judge on the high federal courts and especially the Supreme Court, and that predates Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
This is not a Trump story.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's the most recent Republican president to do it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He bears responsibility.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Fox, which so often cheers for Republican and MAGA candidates in Trump who created this reality and said it would be good, limited this to just 12 minutes and their super MAGA evening host didn't mention it at all.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"This alone, maybe not Donald Trump's trials, maybe not Joe Biden's age, but this alone could capsize everything they have going into November.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"We don't know, but the 90,000, 50,000, 60,000, 40,000 ballots dropped in Trump's category and then came out verbatim.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"In 2020, lifelong Republican Jeff Lake backed Democrat Joe Biden over Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I can't support Donald Trump in 2024 because of the chaos.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Now are there things Kamala Harris has to do is Kamala Harris for policies I disagree with: absolutely.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's a Democrat, but will this Republican to Republican outreach make a difference in what's expected to be a razor thin election in November: it's still a red state and you need Republican crossover votes in order to win longtime Arizona pollster.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
They have to get past the personality conflict and they have to make it about more pressing issues if they're going to be successful.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But in 2020, to Trump and his political party, this long process was evidence of election fraud.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Pro-Trump protesters, some armed, gathered outside Maricopa County's elections departments in the days after the election, demanding a faster vote, while Trump's supporters in other states asked to stop the count.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump is making it seem like people.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He said people don't speak the language.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Former President Trump may be out of the White House, but his influence on the Republican Party continues to loom large, especially on the state level.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The unwavering Trump supporter challenged the state's election results in a lawsuit.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Basically people who want Donald Trump to remain in office, even though he lost the election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Previously it seemed Harris had gained approximately 34 points over where President Biden had been in the race.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Next for the Hill Emerson, previously we saw Harris jumping up by 2 points in late August with Trump at 15, Harris at 47.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
In August Fox News conducted an RV poll which saw a 6-point gain for Harris with her leading Trump 50 to 49.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"However their poll in late September switched to an LV model, saw Trump gaining 2 points to reach 51 while Harris dropped to 48, a net gain of 4 for President Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Finally back in August Bloomberg Morning Consult's RV survey had Trump gaining 2 points to tie Harris at 48.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"After almost four years, borders are Kamala Harris has decided for political reasons that it's time for her to go to the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's gone to the border for years.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"What a disgrace that is that she waited so long allowing millions and millions of people to enter our country from prisons and jails, mental institutions and insane asylums.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"When Kamala is seen at the border on Friday, she will pass hundreds of miles of wall that was built by Trump.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now when she speaks, I hope everybody remembers that she has caused our cities, our towns and our country itself tremendous damage.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And I think maybe I'll have to take some to Kamala Harris for every time she does a softball interview, she wants to wear some body armor.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now, she's only doing these softball interviews.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And unfortunately, for Kamala Harris, every time that she does an interview, she makes our case for us.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I got to go around and just remind the American people that Donald Trump delivered rising take-home pay and low inflation.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's a pretty easy job, governor Walz has to go around and somehow convince the American people that Kamala Harris is going to solve the very problem she's been creating over the last three and a half years.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But here's the reality, is that under Kamala Harris's policies, she cast trillions, she cast the deciding vote on trillions of dollars of new spending.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
It's because of Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So when she stands before the American people and says, on day one, we're going to tackle the affordability crisis, or on day one, we're going to secure that southern border, our response to Kamala Harris needs to be, day one was 1,400 days ago, Kamala.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now, we know, of course, that the people who are hit the hardest by Kamala Harris's terrible policies are very often those who can least afford to pay an extra $100 to go to the grocery store, or pay a few hundred extra dollars in rent per month.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Fight for you every single day, we're going to make groceries more affordable.",Donald Trump,Arizona
We're going to make housing more affordable.,Donald Trump,Arizona
We're going to make the American dream more affordable.,Donald Trump,Arizona
It's always useful to sort of compare and contrast because I feel bad sometimes for anybody who's listening to Kamala Harris's interviews because there's no specifics.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"All right, so Kamala Harris's economic plan is to wage war on American energy, drive up the cost of oil, drive up the cost of natural gas, and drive up the cost of everything that requires low energy costs, which is everything that we buy, from the homes that we buy to the food that gets delivered to the grocery store.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You know, Donald Trump's plan to bring down energy prices is very simple.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is going around the country bragging.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump is going to lower your taxes.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, Kamala Harris wants to open.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump's plan is simple.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, there's a big lie at the heart of the Kamala Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I don't know where she gets this because for four years, Donald Trump was the president of the United States.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
But now she's come up with this lie because she's trying to scare our senior citizens.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's trying to say that somehow Donald Trump is going to go after Social Security and Medicare.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Well, you know what Donald Trump's plan is to protect Social Security and Medicare: make sure that those benefits go to the people who paid for them and not illegal aliens.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Because Kamala goes around the country, she has said explicitly that she wants to give Social Security and Medicare benefits to people who don't have the legal right to be in this country in the first place.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So to every person who has come into the country illegally under Kamala Harris's leadership, Kamala Harris wants to roll out the red carpet, give free health care and housing benefits.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump has a different idea.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump's plan is pretty simple.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But most importantly, let people know why you want Donald J. Trump to be the next president of the United States of America.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And the third request I'm going to make is I want every single person in this audience to get out there and vote for Donald Trump 10 times.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I want you to talk about why you're voting for Donald Trump, especially on social media.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That if there's a, Kamala Harris put that sign up, ladies and gentlemen.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I'm telling you, she did.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's already trying to steal the 2024 election right here in this beautiful facility.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And as much as Kamala Harris brags and says inflation is over, do any of us in this room feel like inflation is over: no, because it's not.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Well, why is the government printing trillions and trillions of dollars: because Kamala Harris cast the deciding vote on trillions and trillions of dollars in new spending.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
You don't have to agree with everything that Donald Trump says.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But Donald Trump's promise, and I think his solemn obligation as president of the United States is to fix what Kamala Harris has broken over the last three and a half years.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And that's exactly what he's going to do, let me make one more.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's what Donald Trump is going to do.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Frankly, he already did it once before.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I want to ask you a little bit because Donald Trump has said before that he will revoke the temporary protective status of some migrants in Ohio.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But this particular issue, I think that what Kamala Harris has done is she has used programs that are meant to help people who are escaping tyranny.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she's used it to grant amnesty to millions upon millions of people who have no legal right to be in the country.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And that has to stop, because here's what happens, here's what happens when Kamala Harris grants millions upon millions of people legal status.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And that's something that Donald Trump and I really believe in, is talking to the American people.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So my question is, if elected, what would the Trump fans administration handle, how would it handle administering ChIPS Act funding moving forward: yeah, so I just want to be clear here that President Trump, more than any political leader of my lifetime, believes in bringing American manufacturing back to the United States of America.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And that includes semiconductors, and one of the things that I, you know, President Trump makes this point all the time is that part of the leverage that communist China has over us is that they control the market for semiconductors for computer chips, which computer chips are in everything, right: they're not just in our phones, they're in our cars, they're in our laptops, they're in our refrigerators.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's a very good thing, president Trump, what he has criticized sometimes is the administration under Kamala Harris's leadership, the way that we try to force these companies.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's option A. That is what Trump thinks that we should be doing, encouraging more manufacturing.",Donald Trump,Arizona
What you've seen under Secretary Raimondo and Kamala Harris is them trying to say that you're only going to get money to manufacture chips if you do what we want you to do politically.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So long as you're paying your workers a good wage and building a great American product, Donald Trump and I will be on your side.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But this thing you see with Kamala Harris where she says we're going to hold your government funding hostage unless you agree with our politics.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But as President Trump said, it is what it is.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And it's going to be very fun to beat Kamala Harris on November the 5th.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But the goal here is to beat the Democrats in the service of solving the country's problems, problems that have been caused by years of Kamala Harris' broken leadership, not just as vice president, but over many, many years.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I think she keeps on making bad decisions for the American people.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Because Kamala Harris has gone to war on the American energy sector.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And you might notice behind me, the venue looks a little bit different from Trump's rallies that we've typically seen here in Arizona, especially over the past month.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Just like he was in the beginning, I've been following him more or less since 1987, from my age, I saw him mature.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He is in the right place, the right age for this right circumstances that are going on now, the right person.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I think that he is about doing something different.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He doesn't, like, have this shirt and let's get used to something different.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And so he doesn't do it the old way.,Donald Trump,Arizona
This is his third visit to Arizona in October alone.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Earlier this month, he was in Prescott Valley rallying supporters there in just last week at ASU talking to supporters in Tempe.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Again, just really underscoring the significance that his campaign believes that Battleground Arizona will have come next week.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So let's go to earlier, this is Kamala Harris's event this afternoon, six miles away from where Donald Trump will speak tonight.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now today at Talking Stick Resort Amphitheater, Harris told the crowd that this November they can choose to turn the page from the former President Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris said she would be a president for quote, all Americans and not just for some.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"If elected, she said she would walk into the Oval Office with a to-do list while she said Trump would walk in with a quote, enemies list.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Now absent from her speech here today was any mention of the southern border or calls for immigration reforms.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Harris did not take questions from the press, so we could not ask her questions on the topic that is of course a major priority to Arizona voters.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She also did encourage her supporters today to get out and vote.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She said that if anyone remains on the sidelines and does not cast a vote, that they cannot have their voice be heard in this consequential election.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She will then continue on to Las Vegas, Nevada, making campaign stops and rallies in both of those cities.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Her running mate, Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz will return here to Arizona on Saturday.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"It tends to be Mr. Trump in the opinion polls in the answer to the question, who will be best to handle the economy: and I think that really is is pretty simple.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The most recent president has been President Biden and Vice President Harris for the last almost four years.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And the recollections of 2018 and 2019 were Mr. Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But the question is, what are the policies of Mr. Trump going forward: it's not about 2018, 2019.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Vice President Harris vows to take on price gouging as a way as a way to combat inflation.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Let's talk about taxes, trump has already said many times he wants to cut taxes, extend his twenty seventeen tax cuts.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris said looking for a middle and working class tax credit, which would be kind of similar, I guess, to redeemed in the same way that the Biden tax credits were implemented.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris wants to increase corporate tax rates.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump wants to cut corporate tax rates.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Right, and we're told that, you know, the Republican administrations and Mr. Trump will cut spending.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"They're going to spend, it's borrowing spent.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, they point the fingers at the Democrats and say Democrats shouldn't be taxing and spending.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump says he can he can pay for tax cuts and he can pay for all of this by increasing tariffs.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But the idea is that what you get from China, especially, but in from other even Canada and Mexico, if you if you're on the Trump side of things, you can build, you can make, you can sell here at home.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And so the question is, why didn't we see inflation in the first Trump term: and the answer to that really is the first couple of years, there were some pretty good policymakers, I think, along with the Trump administration.",Donald Trump,Arizona
They left or he fired them.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Mr. Navarro pushed them over the edge with with tariffs.,Donald Trump,Arizona
That would have been very difficult for Ms. Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And it was obviously difficult for Mr. Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, if you don't want your taxes raised and you're a high income earner, you're not going to be a fan of Ms. Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's probably going to raise taxes for high income people.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Right, she says not for lower income people.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I think the Harris administration would be more likely to let the Federal Reserve continue their fight against inflation, which they appear to be winning.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Mr. Trump, if you look at what he did in the late 2018, he got all upset because the Federal Reserve tried to raise rates in late 2018 and it was very upsetting.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He wants low interest rates, low interest rates right now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But it would also be inflationary, we should mention that he also wants more executive control over the Fed, which that's right.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She's not the border czar.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's not in charge of the border.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So all of the problems that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have caused, all of their failed policies, they're now just putting it all on Trump.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And if you listen to the average leftist talk, you would think that Trump has been president for the last four years.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But as Kamala continues to try to blame the southern border on Trump, which we know that's not the case, no one has talked about illegal immigration and the southern border more than Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
That's how much Trump talks about it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
This is Kamala Harris is doing.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Not because I don't believe that Trump can beat Kamala, it's because of the other factors that are at play here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Are you planning on voting for Donald Trump and JD Vance, are you planning on voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz: okay.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I was seeing a lot of the things that she was saying.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And though I adore her extensive and very incredible history and education she does have, there was just some stuff that even like younger Democrats on the side really think are important.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And so like it thrills me to see people who will stand up to Donald Trump and his supporters and his apologists and say, no, that's a bridge too far.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"For just under an hour, Trump talked with a military-heavy audience in North Carolina about issues from immigration and hurricane relief to veterans affairs and international relations.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"At an event space Friday in Fayetteville, near Fort Liberty, among the world's largest military installations, thousands of attendees sat in tears of seats and folding chairs as Trump took several questions from people, all of whom had some connection to the military.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"One Vietnam veteran, who moderator Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida said had written Trump a letter after the July assassination attempt in Butler, gave the former president his purple heart, saying Trump deserved it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump bookend his remarks by saying that he would revert the name of Fort Liberty to Fort Bragg.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Right now Kamala Harris's weeks old presidential campaign got a massive jolt of energy from an electric rally Friday here in the valley.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Can the Democratic presidential nominee and her running mate Tim Walz ride the vibes to victory in Arizona and on to the White House: here are some of the sounds from the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaign rallies on Friday.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Here's a live look from the Kamala Harris rally in Las Vegas.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, what you're seeing is the enthusiasm for the vice president in Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And a poll last week by high ground public affairs shows Harris leading Trump by almost three points within the margin of error.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And I never believed the polls that had President Trump up six, eight points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He thought he was facing Joe Biden.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is proving to be a far more competent and stronger candidate than many thought.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Can I have a sense of question, will Donald Trump continue to have a hard time dealing with a black candidate, let alone a talented one: well, the problem with Donald Trump is that when he doesn't have a vision to offer, he starts to go and he starts to personalize attacks.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Can Trump avoid going there: well, it needs to be about the issues.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And it's like Kamala Harris's entire record just doesn't doesn't matter.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she's kind of rewriting history in terms of her position on the border.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And from that point, when Kamala Harris was attorney general, she went after drug smugglers, human traffickers.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She has a history.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Donald Trump, he talked about Mexico building a wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris back one of the strongest border protection bills that this country has seen in decades.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Donald Trump, on the other hand, urged Republicans not to support it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Despite Trump facing serious allegations of helping incite the January 6th attack on the Capitol and then allowing the violence to fester for hours, his picks for office are on the cusp of winning major races.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The Democrats in a risky move even running TV ads, highlighting Gibbs' ties to Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And his back candidate, Kerry Lake, was a longtime popular news anchor here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Now there's a lot of questions of whether he was going to only give the endorsement to Greitens right now, who is sort of the underdog, but he's the former governor who is facing a series of allegations, including domestic abuse, sexual abuse, blackmail that has made a lot of Republicans nationally concerned about if he were to win this primary and go to the general election, could the Missouri Senate seat potentially fall into Democratic hands?",Donald Trump,Arizona
It's not difficult to understand why Democrats are terrified while Republicans are somewhat optimistic about Trump's prospects when asked how members of both parties feel about this election.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Just glance at the battlefield polling, except for one, that of naturally Wisconsin, where Harris is likely to lose her lead in the following several days, Trump leads in every single swing state.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump is in far better shape than he was four years ago and even far better than he was in 2016 when he beat Hillary Clinton.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana, South Carolina, Alaska, and the second district of Maine, with 126 electoral votes, Trump leads now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is not going to be able to accomplish such.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She's most likely going to win by about 10 points at most.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Kamala Harris will triumph by rather less than 15.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Obama, Clinton, and Biden, the last three Democratic nominees, each get about 17 points, harris simply isn't performing as well as the prior three nominees, though.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She will most likely be the poorest performing Democrat in any contest since 1988.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Then, ascending to the Northeast, this is truly where Harris's performance has been appalling, particularly in New York.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala Harris leads the Empire State today by just 13.5% in the polling, hence this is not a flutter.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
This is not one or two surveys displaying her with such an appalling margin.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Though she hasn't cracked 15, Kamala Harris is doing better.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
New York will so probably be blue on her map for the first time since 1988.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Kamala Harris is so at 191 electoral votes, filled in for the vice president, both with the solid and probable states currently.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And Kamala Harris won't even be getting near in 2024.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump most likely will be able to win both of these states by 10 percentage points or more.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Although Trump is going to win Texas for a third consecutive time, the previous president stands to get a sizable gift.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump has not performed as well though, in 2016 and 2020, Texas usually is shifting to the left.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It hasn't been from strongest state during the last eight years.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And Trump is going to prevail in Florida today by little over seven points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump thus keeps his advantage with both the solid and probably states filled in.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He presently has 219 electoral votes.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris most likely will win the state by barely under seven points.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Should she not have, Minnesota very likely would have become a tilt state supporting either Harris or even Trump.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And looking at the state's polling, Harris leads by just 4.7%, even running under the literal governor.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Running in 2020 with Kamala Harris as his vice presidential candidate, who is not from anywhere near Minnesota, Joe Biden was able to win the state by a projected seven point margin.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And thus this is yet another aspect of Harris failing Biden from four years ago.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Actually, I would guess his chances lie at about 20%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"In his last race, Joe Biden prevailed in the state by a double digit margin.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Furthermore, if you additionally review the polling here, two recent left leaning polls released explain why she is up by such a great margin.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris is the extremely modest favorite in Nebraska's second district as well.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Just the seven swing states at last, though Harris's performance has been so bad that many of these states are just as competitive as states like Minnesota and Virginia that Biden easily won in the past.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Turning now to polling today, Donald Trump leads the state by 1.1%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He is very definitely the favorite.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Really, just look at this poll distribution, he leads practically every single one of them.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Apart from a very brief moment at the Democratic Convention when she peaked, Kamala Harris never led in Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But Trump has been ahead ever since, able to maintain his lead.",Donald Trump,Arizona
I expect the polling here will understate Trump once more.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He visited Trump five years ago in 2016.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He also defeated Georgia 0.24.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"On the polling average, Trump leads by 0.5%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump's performance thus has already been far better than it was versus Biden in the previous contest.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And when considering the poll locations here, Trump leads in an astounding majority.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump has also been ahead virtually all during the election season.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He will score two to three points to win it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Apart from this Atlas Intel poll, all of them, other from the three ties, Trump leads in every single one of them.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris is not ahead and even one, kamala Harris also has never led North Carolina.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Furthermore, given how much polls exaggerate Democratic support, Harris truly has no chance in the real elections if she cannot even lead here.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump most likely will be able to win this state by three to five percent points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump is thus just eight electoral votes from the presidency currently.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He requires one more state only.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Furthermore, Trump has passed one three of these states.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Actually, he won all of them against Hillary Clinton by slim percentages back in 2016.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And he just needed one of them at that point as well.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"For Donald Trump, this is quite welcome news.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump lately started leading once more, even when Biden was still running before his catastrophe of a debate performance.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The race has been somewhat tight, still, Trump is definitely going to bring Pennsylvania back under his presidency.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Right now, Trump is once more the favorite.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But he most obviously does not need this state.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Actually, none of the three surviving states are ones he truly needs to win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump lags just zero point three percent in Wisconsin.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Out of the five most recent state polls, though, Trump leads in every single one of them.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"In more than two weeks, Harris hasn't led the state.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And shortly after this Marquette poll ends, Trump will lead here rather quite soon.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And thus, looking at the average over the past few months, Harris has been ahead essentially from Michigan's entry into the race.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She will soon be behind, though, and on November 5th, she will also lose Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He is winning each of them by margins of about one percent point.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
That Trump now leads in the polls average surprised me greatly.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He leads Harris by zero point two percent.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He leads by six, according to the New Wall Street Journal survey.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Still, given Trump's poll rise, I will temporarily mark it in the tilt red column.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Should he be able to sustain this momentum: i do think he will be the first Republican to turn Nevada in two decades.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"With 312 electoral votes, Donald Trump readily secured reelection by his highest margin yet, Kamala Harris at just 226, the worst Democratic performance since 1988.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's going to be the state that if Trump gets it more likely than not, he's over the hump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's going to win if he gets Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Doesn't necessarily mean that these other states don't matter and that he wouldn't like to do well across the board because yeah, if you get Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, you won't need Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And Trump got just that because the Green Party is on the ballot.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But nevertheless, the more third parties the better, look at 2016, trump won the state with 48.1% of the vote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if Trump is really getting 47% of the vote already in Arizona without undecideds, if Biden's down there at 42, let's say the end result is like 48.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump now, even though you may say his favorables dropped a couple percentage points from like three years ago.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"They're not really down that much, they are up significantly in most polling from where Trump was at back in 2016 leading up to the election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump is going to go out there and unite the party behind him.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"If Trump gets 48% in Arizona, even let's say he falls short in the state, but Carrie Lake gets 46-47.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And these third parties will help Donald Trump out significantly as well in the state.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, Trump will be at 270, you only need 270 to win, but you'd like to have Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if Donald Trump goes out there, he's winning the popular vote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
That's an even bigger mandate that he has.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, this is a state Donald Trump can win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Yeah, Trump has struggled among those suburban white college educated voters.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That may be true, but at the end of the day with him on the ballot galvanizing his own base, picking off Hispanics, and you see some of those college educated suburbanites, you know, defecting from Biden, maybe not to Trump, but to third party candidates.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, what does that show you: it shows you that Donald Trump is going to be in an even stronger position to go out there and take the Grand Canyon State.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And then the polls ended up being right, well, look what happened, those same polls show Donald Trump doing very well because it's across the board and everybody knows it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And even though these people don't like Trump, they also don't like Biden.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And also, it seems like the Trump hatred fatigue is kind of kicking in because, yeah, the only people I really see foaming at the mouth angry at Donald Trump are like the DeSantis influencers right now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The Supreme Court's not going to take him off.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And even then, he's not going to be taken off, like I said, till the Supreme Court rules that he will be, and they won't.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Former President Donald Trump is doubling down on his baseless claims surrounding the 2020 election.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He touted the big lie during a rally in Arizona over the weekend.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He addressed crowds of supporters during this event dubbed the, quote, rally for election integrity.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He also took shots at the state Republican governor, Doug Ducey.",Donald Trump,Arizona
His remarks come on the heel of an Associated Press investigation that identified fewer than 200 cases of potential voter fraud in the state from last year's presidential election out of more than 3 million ballots cast.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That's far fewer than the 10,000 plus vote margin by which President Joe Biden narrowly beat Donald Trump in the state.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And you even had President Trump saying, hey, vote by mail and then show up on election day.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He keeps losing again and again and again, even worse than he thought.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And that quest continues, donald Trump demanded that Texas, a state he won, investigate its election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And overnight, just eight and a half hours after getting his marching orders from his leader, Governor Greg Abbott complied with his leader.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And that bigger loss for Donald Trump, Joe Biden, picked up 99 votes per the cyber ninja count versus what Maricopa County officially found.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump lost 261 votes.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Governor Greg Abbott caving to Trump's demands.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Why does Donald Trump want audits in a state that he won: you know, that's a great question.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Only one of those counties went for Donald Trump in the 2020 election.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So all in all, this was the state where Donald Trump had his best chance to prove the outlandish theories that he's had about the elections being fraudulent or rigged.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's the way you're going to get Trump people to stop believing the big lie.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Give Trump his chance to prove it.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They've swung and missed every time so far.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And it shows that it was Republicans who abandoned Donald Trump at the top of the ticket.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And this isn't something you see too often on Donald Trump's side.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So January 6 makes Donald Trump absolutely unfit for office.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And the second young lady really had an issue with January 6, which I think is going to turn a lot of people away from Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I couldn't agree more, it's adult time and Donald Trump needs to sit at the kids' table, or better yet, in jail.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Single-handedly, Donald Trump single-handedly changed the Republican Party for what it was.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So you think Trump probably does have an advantage in Arizona: yes.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump is ahead, trump is favored.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"In other words, if she wins Georgia, it means she's going to win all the Great Lakes states and probably the silver state as well.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So it's probably Trump's third best of them, probably.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And I'd make him the favorite there.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And my Democratic sources today would make him the favorite there as well.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So what percentage of the number of people who vote are black: and she can get her numbers back up to where Democrats typically are.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Two big ifs, she'll win.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But Trump is doing well with the young black men there and the normal way he wins states running up in exurbs and rural areas.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So some combination of her swelling black vote, holding her own with black vote and suburban voters, particularly women, she could win it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But Trump is the favorite there.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"That war would have never happened, i believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But actually, it's not, a lot of them are still backing Trump because they believe the war would not have happened if he were president, that he's a tough guy or a deal maker or whatever it is that they've heard in their part of the media atmosphere.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The Harris campaign is all about getting high, big name celebrity sort of endorsers and, you know, making carefully crafted statements and speeches and public events that are meant to signal to this community that Harris would be better.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And what the Trump campaign does is they get on the ground and they engage with people and the people in the community feel more, you know, seen.",Donald Trump,Arizona
They also feel like they have access or at least they can buy access.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I wonder if Klitschko is going to get a call from the Harris campaign at some point, right: finally, interference.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Watch out for that foreign interference, that's true, absolutely, you still, you know, the Trump people were working with the Polish president who came to Pennsylvania and all but endorsed Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"All the other swing states, too, he is ready to be reinstated as president.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Why is it taking so long: he said today, quote, the Arizona Senate patriots are moving forward with the final results to be announced in the not too distant future.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But based on today's hearing, why even wait, yeah, why even wait: president Biden should just move out now because Republicans and cyber ninjas have fixed the problem of Trump apparently losing the election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Now he gets to be president again.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Why even wait: so, I mean, in all seriousness, that whole thing about Trump thinking he's still president and importantly telling his supporters that the fraud has been proven and Biden's only pretending to be president and he got there based on a crime.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And he needs to get thrown out because he's not a real president.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's illegitimate.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has endorsed both of them, covering all his bases.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Next Tuesday, a week from today, Harris plans to barnstorm the country with her Vice Presidential running mate starting in Philadelphia and then heading west.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Are you really going to ignore President Trump: we thought he could count on you, Burnovich says.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Don't miss your chance to be on Trump's team.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump hasn't endorsed Burnovich in Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And in fact, Trump threw a fundraiser for one of Burnovich's opponents.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But Trump has not endorsed anyone in that Senate race.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Burnovich's heart may lie with Trump, but his obligation remains to the people of Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He should resign, that's from the Arizona Republic today.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I did that, and now he's trying to enforce it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"How's the vote: well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to be voting for Biden Jack, this man right here who's running for Congress, District 3, and he's going to be in Georgia.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And he's going to be a big-time politician, and he loves our country, and he loves Georgia.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He says he's our political leader.,Donald Trump,Arizona
How do we hurt Trump so that maybe Biden can eke out a victim: i don't think it's going to happen.,Donald Trump,Arizona
These are people that are deeply into Donald Trump's pocket.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And so here we are with what I call them the Trump ninjas because the company is cyber ninjas and Doug Logan is their CEO.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Let me ask you about another topic you were with Vice President Kamala Harris when she visited the border on Friday.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris has said she would extend President Biden's executive actions that restrict asylum.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She would ramp up prosecutions against those who cross the border illegally.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
It was great to have her there.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She got to meet with elected leaders, talk about these issues specifically and how it affects Arizona, the state of Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Hey, she's a prosecutor.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's a border senator, a border attorney general.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She knows how to handle these issues.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
He just wants to talk about problems.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So, yeah, I mean, she's she's prepared on day one to deal with this issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She said she would sign that legislation into into law.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's not the situation here, i mean, she is trying to manage and will try to manage a situation at our southern border that often gets chaotic and can get to a crisis.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So she's committed to working on this issue.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
That's why she was meeting with the Cochise County sheriff two days ago and Republican mayors in the area.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
We had some productive conversations and she's ready to deal with this on day one.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Of course, the vice president also put a focus on that this week, saying she would raise corporate taxes to pay for her economic plans.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The nonpartisan tax foundation estimates that raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, which Harris has proposed, will cost jobs, reduce wages and hurt economic growth.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Do you support raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent: well, I think it got lowered too much under Donald Trump's tax plan, where he also, by the way, gave a giant tax cut to billionaires like himself.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump added trillions of dollars to the deficit.,Donald Trump,Arizona
His Project 2025 plan is going to raise costs for families.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, that's Donald Trump's plan.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is focused on bringing down costs for Americans and American families on child care and health care on prescription drugs.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
She cares about families.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump cares about billionaires.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's made that perfectly clear in his last administration.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I expect in and his plan, Project 2025 pretty much says he's going to double down on what he did previously.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's trending towards Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if there's a lot update here, you can see recently Trump has really expanded his lead.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But even here, I mean, since late August when it was basically a toss up, you've got Trump up to around a two thirds chance to win the state.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"She did do a town hall last night, but not investing a ton of time in Arizona, Nevada.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You look at the Sun Belt, it seems to be swinging to Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's also even Nevada, which was kind of seen recently as the one swing state that you could argue was swinging maybe in the direction of Kamala Harris based on the polling.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Well, there have been some recent polls that have come out, maybe a few outliers, but Trump has been up in a number of them.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And I wanted to see if it had really had an effect on the betting and it has had at least a little bit of an effect.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump's got like a five, six point lead in a few polls in Nevada, i don't think that's going to happen in terms of what actually happens on election night.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"When you look at the popular vote, Trump losing it by a point that seems pretty realistic.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"It's going to be 47.6 to 46.6, obviously if that happens to where he loses the popular vote by just one single point, it's going to be, you would figure a relatively easy electoral college victory and you do have Trump winning every swing state here and it being split basically exactly how I expect it to be split with Trump taking every single swing state.",Donald Trump,Arizona
You've got a few polls that have Trump up by two.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"There was that USA Today poll that had Trump up by six, but recently we're seeing a very nice trend in Trump's direction with many of these polls.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That was Trump plus three, so that might be bringing him down a little bit in terms of this, but I would still say Donald Trump is pulling, especially relative to where he was in 2020.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, you've right now you've got Trump sitting plus 0.5, obviously very close, but it wouldn't surprise me if we saw more positive movement in Trump in Trump's direction when it comes to Arizona and then taking a look at Nevada.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You do now have Donald Trump because of that wall street journal poll with him being up by six with a very, very slight lead.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So he underperformed that pretty significantly when you look at the final result versus where we were this time in October of 2020.,Donald Trump,Arizona
So Trump's made up significant ground there and he's also made up ground when you look at 2016.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I would certainly not expect Trump to win the state by five or six points.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think that's a bit ridiculous, but like even the recent polls that have Harris up, it's very, very close.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And you can see, I mean, Harris was sitting plus one.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"At least he's gotten in 2020 and 2016, liberals will argue there's going to be a correction, but you can't really predict a correction.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Well, the midterms are totally different, trump's not even on the ballot in the midterms.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump sweeps all of the swing states wins all seven of them.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump wins Arizona by like two and a half points, trump wins Wisconsin by like a point and a half, trump wins Michigan by like point seven, trump wins Pennsylvania by like a point, trump wins Georgia by like two points, trump wins North Carolina by like a point and a half, like that's the margins we're looking at and then possibly losing the popular vote by just a point or maybe even under a point like forty seven to forty six, forty eight to forty seven, forty eight and a half to forty seven and a half, something like that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Let's see this, these liberals are school less on tariffs and why Trump's big bad tariffs are horrible.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Oh, that's so bad, let's see what they have to say about the Trump tariffs.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So when it comes to Trump, do you dislike his policies or him as a person or both: i don't I don't dislike Trump as a person in the sense that I've never met the guy.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"A lot of the stuff Trump talks about, he still doesn't know how tariffs work.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So these like these smug guys, Trump doesn't know what he's talking about.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's only a multi billionaire.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He doesn't know how tariffs work.,Donald Trump,Arizona
He's going to hurt the American consumer because the companies are going to have to drive their prices up because they're going to have to pay people a real living wage rather than outsourcing to China for mass production where the Chinese workers there make like they're in sweatshops that make nothing.,Donald Trump,Arizona
The stop he made in this plea he's making to African-American men.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, he said today he insulted them.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, he first of all admits that they're not enthusiastic about her.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
He said you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president and you're coming up with other alternatives and reasons for that.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on and told him to kill the bill, don't put it up for a vote.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution because he wants to run on a problem.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But then Trump got mad, so Republicans killed the bill to help Donald Trump's presidential campaign.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump is now, when he's not busy, peddling dangerous racist lies about Haitian immigrants eating labradoodles or whining about getting impeached over trying to extort Ukraine as he did today in his meeting with Ukrainian president Zelensky.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Well, when he's not doing those things, he's hawking $100,000 watches.",Donald Trump,Arizona
The Harris campaign laying out some specific plans to tackle immigration and the border in a brand new ad ahead of her visit today.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Watch that, kamala Harris has never backed down from a challenge.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She put cartel members and drug traffickers behind bars and she will secure our border.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Here's her plan, hire thousands more border agents, enforce the law and step up technology and stop fentanyl smuggling and human trafficking.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And that's Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Vice president getting herself on offense on the issue of immigration with a visit to the southern border is where we start today.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But this participation by this very, very conservative Republican who said that is true, I thought was a moment that could sort of make a comeback in the campaign and Kamala Harris is making sure it does.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I bet the Harris campaign has at least asked to try to make that happen.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"In 2016 and 2020, certainly some prominent Republicans criticized him, but not many, not in a big group.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"What is it about a potential second Trump term that worries you the most: well, they're the same as with the first one.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But in your view, if you're not voting for Donald Trump, but also not voting for Harris, you view it as a wasted vote.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And like I say, I know Kamala Harris, I know Tim Walz.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"You know, just at the race overall, this weekend we heard Donald Trump calling Vice President Harris mentally disabled.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That is a quote, which obviously is offensive to people who do have disabilities, but he says that on the campaign trail.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Today he's saying that Kemp can't get in touch with Biden about the hurricane response.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Harris was up by two, i'm sure that's in the, it is within the margin of error.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And right now there's kind of a honeymoon period for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That shows Kamala Harris ahead by three points, again, within the margin of error.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So I think there's a lot of kind of waiting, when will this honeymoon period end and when will she address those three specific issues: as we heard a minute ago, there's a new add out talking about Kamala Harris now embracing the toughest border security bill in decades that stalled in Congress, largely because of Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So that's how immigration is gonna play out, she's gonna have to answer questions though and news conferences, interviews specifically about what she did and how the border got to the place it's in right now.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So Tim, let's talk a little bit about the border because she has taken probably some of the hardest hits on that issue, right: the president of the National Border Patrol Council went after her yesterday at an event in Chandler, Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I would also say that we have seen a rapid decrease since the executive order from the Biden Harris administration, extremely low unauthorized border crossings, record lows in June.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And I think that's what's important, so Bram, Senator Mark Kelly obviously did not get the job as Harris this morning made, although a lot of people had a lot of reasons why they thought he should.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"When Fox News mentioned the findings, Trump responded, and we put this up on screen, Fox News and other media outlets incorrectly side with the outdated and terrible Maricopa County Election Board to report no fraud found in the presidential election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Just as a reminder, Trump lost Arizona by nearly 11,000 votes fair and square.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And you remember he gave this sort of a dirge of a victory speech on election night in the Brady Room.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He came out and said, we've won.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But when he said we won, there were one of the five key states.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And that meant that he would definitely need Pennsylvania, and he looked far away from home in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So I understand why Trump was angry about Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And I understand why he was angry about the call, because it disrupted a narrative that he wanted to put in place so that he could steal the election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And our reporting was, at the time, that Trump, where his people were both, were burning up the phone lines to Fox executives, the Murdoch family and so on, to try to change this call that you made, that your team made.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Trump, Giuliani and that team has brought legal challenges to the election results over 60 times to no avail.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris is set to make her first border visit of her presidential run.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"The New York Times says despite what appears to be a slight Harris lead, Trump is leading in three Sunbelt states according to fresh polls.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump has a five point lead over Harris in Arizona and a four point lead in Georgia with a modest two point lead in North Carolina.,Donald Trump,Arizona
One thing to keep in mind is these polls continually underestimate Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"One thing to note, this is a stark change from the same poll in August when Harris led in both Arizona and North Carolina within the margin of error.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"As you can see from this, Donald Trump is doing very well in the swing states, the key states that he needs to win in order to win the election.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He continues to rise in the polls and Kamala Harris continues to go down.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"One other key thing to note in this article is that even though Kamala Harris is just two points behind Donald Trump in North Carolina, Trump has won this state in both previous elections.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Now with these polls taken into consideration Harris going down to visit Arizona.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
I've already filled out the states that are likely to vote for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
It's definitely going to go to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Again, a left leaning media source and they still have Trump ahead in Arizona by five points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"As we previously mentioned in this poll, Donald Trump, he has won North Carolina in the previous two elections and he is pulling significantly ahead of Kamala Harris currently.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"However, Donald Trump is soaring in the polls now.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I think Kamala Harris' recent botched interview with Oprah really has her struggling to make any headway, so I think Wisconsin is ultimately going to go to the Republicans and it will give the Republicans a win in the 2024 presidential race, giving them 278 Electoral College votes.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Kamala Harris seems to be pulling slightly ahead according to some polls.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
And Donald Trump has a strong stance being pro-fracking.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And Kamala Harris is anti-fracking, even though recently she's come out and said that she isn't.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump won most of the key swing states.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"And if you look at current polling numbers in the trends of these polling numbers, you can see that Donald Trump is soaring in all of these Sunbelt states and he's winning in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania as well.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So the current prediction for the 2024 presidential race have Donald Trump ahead 312 electoral votes to Kamala Harris with just 226.,Donald Trump,Arizona
The Republican candidate Donald Trump has held a rally in his home state of New York.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"An iconic venue in Donald Trump's hometown, he's wanted to hold a rally here for years.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump had lined up his favorite famous supporters for this rally from an old wrestler to the eldest son to the world's richest man.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Ms Harris later held a rally to cap off the day where she brought up the conflict in the Middle East a key issue to voters who are unhappy with the Biden Administration's response to the Israel-Gaza War.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And that is why we're seeing both candidates, both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, out on the campaign trail trying to drum up as much support as possible, particularly among some of those persuadable voters, some of those people who might not have cast a ballot at all in the last election, hoping to somehow gather enough votes together to be able to win.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So, Donald Trump, you heard in that report from our colleague Gary there speaking about economy, immigration, about crime.",Donald Trump,Arizona
These are themes that we continue to hear from Donald Trump on the campaign trail.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And he painted a fundamentally dark picture of where the country is right now.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He talked about sinister and corrupt forces underway in the U.S. and he used this phrase, the enemy within.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's used this to talk about what he calls the radical Marxist, left Marxist in this country.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's talked about his own democratic political opponents as enemies, more dangerous, as he has said, than Iran or Russia or China, foreign adversaries.",Donald Trump,Arizona
So that is a message that Donald Trump doubled down on today.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Mr Trump's poll leads in North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia are between one and two points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"While this was all going on, while you didn't get a phone call yourself from President Trump, repeated phone calls, were you aware of this fake electors gambit that the president and his team was going through: well, I don't think we were aware at the time that it was an orchestrated scheme by the former president and his allies.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"In this poll, Harris leads with 50% of the vote, while Trump follows with 47%, giving Harris a three-point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"In this poll, Harris sits at 49%, but Trump edges ahead with 50%, giving Trump a slim one-point lead.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Just like before, Trump holds a slight advantage with 50%, while Harris is just behind at 49%, showing how close this race remains.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"This survey shows Trump ahead once again by one point, with 49% of the vote compared to Harris's 48%.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"So, what do these numbers tell us: harris started with a slight lead in one poll, but Trump consistently holds a one-point advantage in three out of four surveys.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Arizona's top elections official is calling for a criminal investigation into potential election interference by Donald Trump and his allies.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Secretary of State Katie Hobbs citing bombshell reports in the Arizona Republic revealing a campaign to intervene on Trump's behalf.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump also attempted to reach that election supervisor leading to this voicemail from the White House.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's attorney calling like to see if there's a way that we could resolve this.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Donald Trump is already facing a criminal probe for his election interference in Georgia.,Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's a he's a Republican who took the same oath that I did to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States and the state of Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona
I just talked to President Trump and he he would like me to talk to you and also see if he needs to give you a call to discuss what's happening on the ground in Maricopa.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Secretary Hobbs, I've had bill collectors in my youth less aggressive than what we've been seeing from the Trump administration here.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"The House Select Committee, investigating the January 6th insurrection, has accused Donald Trump of playing a direct and personal role in pressuring state and local officials to help overturn Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.",Donald Trump,Arizona
What happened to Mike Pence wasn't an isolated part of Donald Trump's scheme to overturn the election.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Republican Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a longtime Trump supporter, testifying Tuesday to the House January 6 Committee.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Tonight, Vice President Kamala Harris made her pitch to voters in the Southeast Valley.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And in order to win that tight race, Harris is trying to appeal to voters like Wanda Stein's from Surprise.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"In her half hour long address, Harris hammered home her plan to protect women's reproductive rights and encouraged voters to support Arizona's abortion ballot initiative.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Harris not devoting time in her speech to the border.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"On the economy, she said her plan involves $25,000 toward down payments for first time home buyers and a $6,000 tax credit to parents of newborns.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Thursday night's rally happening inside the Rawhide Event Center on the Gila River Indian Community, a community she also appealed to in her speech.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And Harris' trip to Arizona continues on Friday, where she's expected to meet with 100 or 150 people from the group Arizona Republicans for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So they say they're gonna be out here for most of the morning, just showing their support, waiting for more numbers to trickle in to kind of see how the state goes.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Mike, yeah, and what are they saying: danielle about, uh, obviously they're happy that the voting is continuing to be counted.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But are they do they want it sooner rather than later, the results is that what they're just there to support as well: for the most part, the people I spoke with Mike are basically upset that, that, you know, a few people have reported that the state has gone to Biden.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"They're concerned about that, they're saying they want the official count before any race is called officially.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And that's what President Trump campaign is also looking forward to as well.,Donald Trump,Arizona
They want those numbers to continue to come in.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"They feel like they do have the votes there in Arizona to continue to flip it back to red there in the position for President Trump and Danielle also do we can we expect another seven p.m. Batch to be released: you know, Mike, I'm not sure exactly what time numbers will be coming in.",Donald Trump,Arizona
But you can see these Trump supporters kind of going against this guy out here.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Looks like he's a counter protester as far as the counter protesters.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Looks like he's the only one out here.,Donald Trump,Arizona
You can see a lot of the Trump supporters now filing in to come over here and say what they have to say to this guy over here who's kind of screaming across.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Can't wait that she's going to come down and visit us and campaign a little bit and I hope she comes and checks out the border.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Border borders are oh, let's hope that she gets some votes over her job she did as a borders are.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now, I want I want you to watch where uh uh Harris she comes in I believe it's Phoenix she's going to come into probably Glendale she's going to talk in the Cardinals, the stadium whatever corporation owns that this week and she's going to talk there now watch she's going to do a hit and run she's not going to go anywhere close to the border and see what I invite you to go to Douglas or no Gallus see what's going on there in the surrounding area just like when you were supposed to go to El Paso you made sure if there's a good part of that town that you were on it you didn't go to the other side that was whitewashed or the dog and pony show was so I hope people remember that of you orders are now I want to mention this on a been a positive note that uh after Bidenomics had uh screwed all the families now remember that uh the the cost if you wanted to keep the same style of living that the average middle class family had to spend eleven thousand dollars more that year okay now there was a family in Pennsylvania that it was reported on Fox News last night that didn't have money for their groceries well guess who picked up the tab that's right president Trump okay let's uh keep it short there we go just over four minutes hope to see you tomorrow and everybody have a good day god bless you and remember Jesus loves you bye",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"I mean, come on, donald Trump also has 48.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Kamala Harris, come to San Diego.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Kamala Harris has now decided to visit the southern border so she can do a little photo op and pretend you know like she actually cares about the issue.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Pretend like she's going to be able to fix the problem, a problem that she created, a problem that she plans on making worse if she's elected, but right now she has to pretend.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She has to pretend and a lot of her followers will follow up right along with her.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Matter of fact, right now as we speak Kamala Harris's followers are praising her appearance and the boots she was wearing at the southern border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"That's what they're worried about, they're worried about her outfit.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"They're not worried about the fact that criminals are pouring through the southern border, some of which are taking the lives of women and children all across America.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"As she was doing this little photo op, the border patrol union started calling her out and putting her on blast on social media.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
She goes down there for 20 minutes for a photo op and decides to repeat some of the things the NPBC has said before.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"But again, where has she been the last three and a half years: and I think that's the question on all of our minds.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And if you ask me, this makes her look even worse.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
It just shows that she's not a genuine person at all.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Let's go forward and read another post, vP Harris asserted in Arizona that CBP needed more resources.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Everything that she's preached about and all of her policies for years.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"For example, she was one of the main people criticizing Trump's border wall.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Now today, or by the time you're watching this video yesterday, she's at the border looking at the border wall.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
And she's talking about building more of the border wall.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She's literally just taking plays out of Trump's playbook because they know that even though they demonize Trump and they talk a lot of crap about Trump, Trump's policies are popular.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"A lot of the stuff that Trump preaches about, even though there's a lot of people out there with TDS that hate him, a lot of the stuff that he preaches about, it hits home for a lot of Americans.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"But I just overall thought this was hilarious watching the border patrol union literally call out Kamala Harris as she's at the border for like the first time ever, 38 days out from the election.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"So he lost Arizona how many times now, Jody: five or six times.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump just tweeted last night.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Trump aware of this prosecutor strategy has been reminding employees to stick together and stay strong as a mob boss does.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So there's a fresh off the presses new poll that has come out that is showing that Kamala Harris is surging absolutely surging in the Sunbelt states now I did do a video yesterday Where it was about how Harris has opened up a second path to victory according to the post polling model So there's actually now a second path to victory that's available and you can see this from these polls So what could happen in the election is you can either have an outcome where the traditional outcome would be You win the rust belt states and you could lose actually all of the Sunbelt you could even lose in Nevada It doesn't matter right you can lose all of them as long as you win the rust belt You would still reach the 270 required to win right the Democrats could win with 270 However, there's now another path that has opened up according to the polling Which is where you lose you win zero of the rust belt states none you win, Nevada, Arizona Georgia and North Carolina and you still win the election So you're actually able to win this election by winning zero rust belt states which in and of itself is super unlikely But it gives you two full paths to victory here And the other thing is you can always do wombo combos of both.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"He was getting hammered, so here's what the numbers say So it's his New York Times Sienna polling shows VP Harris has put the Sunbelt back in play in May Trump led Biden by an average of 10 points in these States now, it's effectively a dead heat So like an average 10-point swing and we'll look at the swings in each individual state absolutely massive, so They have here they have Arizona 50 to 45 in favor of Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"Yes, we're in all of them Kamala doesn't need all of them, but NC is huge Also, I've been kind of tracking because I was curious about what's going on in NC and see there was a massive shift I should have pulled up the election results.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
So Trump is up point nine in the aggregate here In This polling aggregate.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"It wasn't even close Then we have Nevada Harris has now cut the lead down to one point in Nevada Nevada seems to be a weird holdout state Where as all the other ones, you know, Harris has taken the lead So she's she had taken the lead but now it's kind of like going away a little bit So point three so it seems to be a little bit stingy, but we have this Trump plus three from against your fall guard We have the tie from Redfield and lint Wilton.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"We can see that the numbers barely flipped back for Trump She had taken the lead by point two, but he took the lead back by point two I don't think there were any new polls added but we can see that It's a big outlier So I think the Georgia numbers don't really make sense that it really stay in line with kind of the other numbers Which is kind of interesting.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"I mean, it's plus two for Trump and then there's not really anything that has Trump this high But I can confidently say in a head-to-head There's no chance that Harris is getting 46 and I highly highly doubt that Trump is getting 50% I think Harris probably also is able to stem a lot of black voters in the state, which is gonna be a big deal But nevertheless Georgia also being an absolute massive shift so we can see here is You know Biden was down six points So she's basically done like a six point swing a lot of those are Kennedy voters who are switching a lot of double haters I think a lot of women so it's a big big deal So here are some of the margins that are shifting so We can see is this is an MIT Sunbelt polls big swing store Terrace AZ Harris up 47 to 43 in May Trump up 44 35 and an unfathomable change man He was down nine points.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"There's still a lot of ground to gain crazy amounts of ground to gain There was no pull done for North Carolina, Nevada Trump was actually up 44 to 30 So it is an absolutely unfathomable shift in favor of Harris and again This is going to continue to grow in my personal belief That's like a 14 point shift pretty much even larger than that or not larger than that maybe like 12 point shift net And then in May Trump was up 42 to 34 in the state of Georgia in this poll So a massive massive unbelievable shift So we have this huge huge Polling boost basically so really really massive shifts and then we also have a large large change in the down ballot races as well So for the NC governor race Josh Stein is up 49 to 39 and the Nevada Senate senator Rosen is up 49 to 40 Which is similar to the cook pool and the Arizona Senate guy goes up 51 to 42 The Senate races are super important as well because it's actually possible for the Democrats to win a trifecta Where they're able to win the Senate and the house the generic ballot polling has the Democrats up by about 1.1 points Which is big.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"That the administration is working on addressing, donald Trump doesn't, you know, have a plan for that.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He doesn't really have a plan for anything except in this case, in the case of border security, trying to kill, actually successfully killing a bipartisan border security deal that was going to go a long way to helping solve this problem.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"You know, Kamala Harris, I think she made the point last night in her speech that given the opportunity, if we can get this through Congress, she'll sign that legislation.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
The problem comes back to people like Kerry Lake and Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"So, you know, I would suggest that they get over themselves and understand that we know how to administer an election here in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
It's going to be a fair election and they should accept the results.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Senator, last night, Vice President Harris gave her closing arguments.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And I think the important point here is that Kamala Harris in that speech last night, you know, really, had a plan and in that plan was to include Republicans at the table.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She just because, and she made it clear that just because somebody didn't vote for her, if somebody voted for Donald Trump, she still cares about their opinion and cares about what they have to offer.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"And they will be at the table, you know, some of them.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"She made it clear that in her cabinet, you know, there will be Republican representation there.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump cares about one person and that's himself.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He made that very clear through his presidency, but also that he doesn't really care about the future of this country.",Donald Trump,Arizona
He's taken away women's reproductive rights and put women across this country in a horrible situation.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's given tax cuts to a very small percentage of the population, billionaires, tax cuts to billionaires, and he's shredded our alliances.",Donald Trump,Arizona
Kamala Harris wants to lead this country into the future in a positive way.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump just wants to drag us back into the past.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"Kamala Harris, she understands this issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
"She was a prosecutor, an attorney general.",Kamala Harris,Arizona
I first met her when she was working on gun violence and how it affected trying to get firearms away from domestic abusers who were criminals.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Donald Trump doesn't understand this issue.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"After the Parkman shooting, he said he was going to do something about it.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"And then he met with the National Rifle Association in the Oval Office that afternoon, changed his mind, and basically says now that he has never done anything productive on this issue.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Donald Trump, again, he has no plan.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"How significant is this win for Masters and really, I guess, for the weight of Trump's endorsement in this state: yeah, good morning, Savannah.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"Blake Masters, who stood alongside Donald Trump just over one week ago at a final campaign rally here, he's going to be facing Democratic incumbent Senator Mark Kelly, who just two years ago won his race year by several points, but is also still kept a positive approval rating here in the state of Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona
She heard the cries of families getting their homes taken away by corrupt banks.,Kamala Harris,Arizona
Trump has focused on his economic record during his presidency.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"In roundtables and town halls with Latino voters, Trump has spoken about creating more jobs with his energy and tariff plans.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"He's also associated economic issues with immigration, the issue he pulls highest on.",Donald Trump,Arizona
And Trump is advocating for extreme measures.,Donald Trump,Arizona
Some experts say that Trump takes his language about immigration too far.,Donald Trump,Arizona
"But most Latinos, particularly U.S.-born Latinos, don't think that Trump is talking about them when he talks about problems with immigration.",Donald Trump,Arizona
"With a little more than one month to go before the November election, Kamala Harris' presidential campaign is working to get Republicans to vote for Democrats.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So as of right now, as of July 12, 2024, Donald Trump has a 4% need in the combination of polls.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He has 48.7% of the vote, but Biden's 44.7.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm just in college Trump is only up by two.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So Donald Trump is really surging in the key state of Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if Donald Trump just wins Arizona and Georgia, which he is almost guaranteed to win at this point in time, and he wins the state of Pennsylvania, Donald Trump wins the presidency as he gets over the 270 electoral vote margin.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So this key Eastern Pennsylvania, if we're going to see Trump win, he's going to have to flip some of these counties as in North Hampton, possibly knee high, possibly Monroe, possibly Nakawana and in Dufferin county.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And comparing to the 2016 map, Donald Trump, when he won it back in 2020, he won it by 0.7%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He won Erie County, he won North Hampton County.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump had about 62% to Secretary Clinton 33.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump had 61 and a half.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And mainly these small margins, i think Donald Trump did really bad in Delaware County.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"81% to about 18, but Trump didn't really get it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he gained margin here because of the amount of vote increase that Biden had in Philadelphia County, even though it did shift Republican by 3 percentage points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When you get these big world areas outside the city, you get when you make up that vote as an our county county when Trump's getting huge margins in these other counties surrounding Pittsburgh.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So that's where Trump has got to really act before he also has to do better in the cities.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He just has to shift the entire state of Pennsylvania into his column.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But in our 50, Trump got 48, trump almost did better than 2016.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, but excuse me, he did do better.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So in some polls, we've been seeing Trump's doing better with young people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Trump just has to play are you better than you were four years ago card like President Reagan.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So that really is going to possibly help Trump because the Democrats are still divided on Israel and Hamas issue.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But I think Trump is playing very smart politically, saying he's for exceptions, he said they ended the debate.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So when you're playing, it's illegal in most cases under under Trump presidency, it's pre split.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he doesn't believe you should abort the baby in the first second or third trimester and as it's vapor and zest, which I agree with.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now both candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are trying really hard to woo the voters in the battleground state with election day just four weeks away.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In his signature style, he took a dig at his political rivals and said that he will save democracy once he's voted back to power.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So the election fever gains momentum, sources are saying that Kamala Harris's campaign has raised a staggering one billion American dollars as of September end, putting a war chest in a much stronger position than Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"With an ale-biting race drawing closer, an interesting popularity trend has also emerged in favor at up years of Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"At least according to one survey, the vice president has managed to galvanize a critical vote bank in her favor.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And now the most recent surveys from September and October indicate that Harris leads Trump at forty seven to forty one percent among the suburban voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So from July to when Harris launched her campaign to now the vice president, it appears, has managed to swing nine percentage points in her favor.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"While Kamala Harris enjoys a steady support on several fronts, when it comes to key issues like immigration and economy, several polls have shown that the voters are leaning towards Donald Trump as the preferred president to deal with these issues.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So with election rallies in the last phase, Donald Trump has proposed ending US income taxes for Americans who live abroad as part of his 2024 presidential campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, Trump's plan could potentially eliminate this burden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"While Trump's proposal targets reducing individual tax bills, his broader economic plans focus on offering tax relief to the companies operating within the United States.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
His overseas tax cut pledge contrasts with the policies that would raise the taxes for businesses manufacturing offshore with tax reforms estimated to exceed $10 trillion over the next decade.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, Trump's focus on tax cuts remains central to his 2024 campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She's joining us live from Washington, DC.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now Kamala Harris is in fact late into the race, has managed to put together one billion dollars.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's bringing in a lot of this big money, the backing of the billionaires.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I think that what's important to note is that one, by the time that the election gets here, which will be on November 5th, Vice President Harris would have spent about two billion dollars, or at least have raised at least two billion dollars.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I think it's important for Vice President Harris to raise this much money.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And the reason being is that literally, she's had only 100 days to run for the President of the United States, and had very little name recognition, even though she once served as a United States Senator, the second black woman, a woman of color, to have served in that role.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's previously held major positions in the state of California as Attorney General, and so on.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But yet, the very public wasn't necessarily familiar with her, and although she is currently the Vice President of the United States of America, but as we know, the Vice President's role is not to overshadow the President.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So I think all of the dollars that you see going into her campaign, whether it's coming from super PAC, which is important, but there's a lot of money also coming from individuals, like people who are truly interested in seeing that she wins this election.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So when you have these super PACs who are investing so much in the campaign of Kamala Harris, now there is going to be a lot of interest in knowing as to who is backing Kamala Harris at this moment.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, in contrast, Donald Trump is managed to get just about 310 odd million dollars.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So the question is this, kamala Harris, till the time that she became the contender, was not seen as a vice president who performed so superbly well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But now the surveys seem to indicate that Kamala Harris is now pulling ahead of Donald Trump.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What has she done right in the last 90 odd days that she's been in the race: i think that one, she's had a great team to campaign on her behalf.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And she herself has been out knocking on every door.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I think she's very committed to not leaving anyone behind.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, she's very visible in the community.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's very visible across the country.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And the campaign has had a robust public relations plan to go out to make sure that the public understands her policy position.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, and also for the public to understand who she is as a candidate and what she will bring to the table if she were to become president of the United States.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So I think communications, why her team has done an excellent job.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"All right, and also with respect to the Black voters within the United States of America, there was in fact this campaign of sorts which said I don't stand with Kamala Harris because she does not stand with me.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This was something that the Black women came out and said, do you think she's been able to convince the Black voters in America that she is the person that they'll have to rely their faith in: because probably she has their best interest that she, when she becomes the president, will push through it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So has she succeeded with the Black voters: well, first and foremost, African-Americans in America have historically voted Democrat.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Like, for example, you see LGBTQI Plus for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And I think people are trying to get things on the momentum, but also to look at who her opponent is.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Early voting begins today in one of the critical swing states, Georgia, former President Bill Clinton, the last Democrat before Joe Biden to flip that state blue campaign in the Peach State for Kamala Harris yesterday.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Where the election is too close to call, one of them though is perhaps more important than the rest, both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in Pennsylvania yesterday.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris going after Trump for his recent comments referring to some Americans as quote enemies from within.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he is out for unchecked power.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's what he's looking for, he wants to send the military after American citizens.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, he was supposed to be the door campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He just can't see them but you have all these balloons up here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's strange, it sounds like he got a little fed up with taking questions and went with an unorthodox way of getting around taking questions.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And moreover, those of you who are nostalgic for the Trump presidency and the Trump economy, you're forgetting all of the other things that come along with when Trump is president.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I know a lot of Republicans were a little worried because Donald Trump wasn't having a whole lot of fun in September.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he was grumpy, he was grousing, you still see it poke through every once in a while.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think a lot of people will be happy to see a Trump that's having fun on the trail because it indicates that he's more confident about where the election is going.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Maybe, but also is he running through the tape here: i mean you combine this concert yesterday with he's campaigning in California, he's campaigning in New York.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean is he really like hustling for the voters that he needs in the final push here, there's a lot of chatter about is Harris doing enough to run through the tape: i don't know that you could really argue that Donald Trump is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's a lot of back and forth about has she done enough to make the case for herself: and yes, that's true, you have to give people something to vote for.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But it would be malpractice to abandon making these points about the kind of fundamental threat that Trump poses to democracy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I think, I hope, we're going to see her do that over this final three weeks here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
All voters' worries about Donald Trump in that regard are baked in.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And speaking of unusual tactics at campaign rallies, one of the things that Harris did yesterday was actually put Donald Trump's comments, his recent comments from the over the weekend, about the enemy within, about using the military on a big screen and playing it for people at the rally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I do remember the day that he suggested that we shoot people on the streets.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Again, Harris isn't actually trying to reach Trump voters at this point.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is trying to reach people who are on the fence or may just not want to vote.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And he wasn't a problem.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And what they're not factoring in is that the people who held him back, the circuit breaker people, aren't going to be in this administration.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump was doing an event that was meant to be him speaking, a town hall, answering questions and talking about what he would be doing as president.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump just started to ask for music to be played instead and then he danced.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's for sure, his play, therefore his playlist and there for the dance moves.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I want to ask you about kind of the new tactic of Kamala Harris as well.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Playing clips of Donald Trump during her rally last night to drive her message in a new way that she believes that she calls him dangerous and unstable.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's now headed to Michigan today.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What are the plans: well, what she's going to be doing in Michigan is highlighting something that she rolled out yesterday.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trying to make that case to black men around the country that especially younger black men that she should be the one with their vote.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And she'll be doing that in an appearance with Charlamagne the God, the radio host for the breakfast breakfast club talking about all of those things.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But she's also taking with three weeks left here a pretty stringent stance against things that Donald Trump has been saying.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So one of the clips that she has talked about is this comment from Donald Trump a couple days ago that there is an enemy within that might need to be dealt with by the military.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And that is her speaking about these comments from former President Trump that there is this enemy within leftist radical people he said that might need to have the National Guard or the military brought in to deal with them.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And those are comments that Harris wants people to be focused on what she thinks about what a Trump presidency take two would be.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is ready to do the job.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice and a champion.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"How is the Democratic Party situated with Kamala Harris at the top to prosecute the case that her candidacy for the presidency is not just necessary because of the opponent that she's running against, but because of standing in the breach on behalf of people will make a difference for them when it matters in 26, 27, and 28.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And in my case, and I think this is true for Vice President Harris as well, the main issue we hear mostly about are costs.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And when you take a stand, as I have and as Kamala has, to take on what I call greed, inflation, going after price gouging, decidedly in favor of a middle class tax cut, helping folks pay for child care, helping folks make ends meet, when you take on those fights, which are, I think, at the core of what people are concerned about, you're going to piss off a lot of billionaires.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In a significant development for the 2024 election cycle, Donald Trump has recently secured a notable legal victory in Pennsylvania that could potentially alter the trajectory of the presidential race.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Trump campaign and its allies have long championed the need for robust measures to ensure that every aspect of the voting process is secure and transparent.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Recent polling data suggests that Trump is currently favored in several key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Georgia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"These states are crucial to the path to victory for any presidential candidate, and Trump's favorable position in these polls could significantly enhance his chances of winning the presidency.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This could lead to increased voter confidence and potentially higher turnout among Trump supporters, which could be a decisive factor in a closely contested state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In addition to the legal and political implications of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's ruling, there are also strategic considerations for the Trump campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision to uphold the requirements for mail-in ballots reinforces the Republican stance on election integrity and provides a boost to Trump's campaign as it prepares for the final stages of the race.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"With favorable polling data in key battleground states and a strong legal foundation, Trump's campaign is positioned to make a significant impact on the outcome of the election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's primary campaign message has focused on election integrity, arguing that stringent measures are needed to prevent voter fraud.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling, which mandates that mail-in ballots be signed and dated, aligns with Trump's position on maintaining strict voting standards.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This legal victory serves as a concrete example of Trump's commitment to securing the electoral process, which can enhance his credibility among voters who are concerned about the potential for fraud.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"By successfully defending these requirements, Trump can argue that his campaign is actively working to ensure fair elections.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The recent ruling provides a tangible victory that Trump's campaign can use to energize supporters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"By highlighting this legal win, Trump can galvanize his base, encouraging them to turn out in greater numbers.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This mobilization is crucial in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, as increased voter turnout among Trump supporters could be decisive in a closely contested election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump can use the ruling to emphasize that his campaign is fighting for the principles he has championed throughout his political career.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This can lead to higher enthusiasm and turnout among his supporters, who are likely to view the legal victory as a validation of their concerns and motivations.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Historically, mail-in ballots have been a significant source of Democratic votes, and any reduction in the number of valid ballots could favor Trump's campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump can argue that Democrats' opposition to these requirements is an attempt to undermine the security of the electoral process.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This broader impact could help secure more favorable voting conditions in key states, potentially benefiting Trump's campaign across multiple fronts.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The legal victory serves as a testament to Trump's ability to navigate and influence legal and political processes, which can enhance his appeal to voters who value these qualities.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Pennsylvania ruling reinforces Trump's campaign's argument that there are vulnerabilities in the electoral system that need to be addressed.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump can use this legal victory to emphasize his commitment to election integrity and contrast it with Democratic positions.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This can be particularly effective in debates, where Trump can highlight the ruling as a success for his campaign and as evidence of his commitment to secure elections.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"By focusing on this victory, Trump can shift the debate narrative to emphasize his achievements in ensuring election security.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The ruling strengthens his campaign's messaging on election integrity, mobilizes supporters, provides a tactical advantage in a key battleground state, and sets a precedent for other states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"19 electoral votes at stake in the Keystone State, according to our partners at Decision Desk headquarters, Vice President Harris has a slight lead over Trump with 49.2%, Trump is at 48.1%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will take their bus tour through central Pennsylvania this week, making multiple stops across the state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump will also be returning there to Butler this week as well, his first time back since the first assassination attempt in July.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Kamala Harris are hitting the campaign trail in the battleground state of Pennsylvania today.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is leading by just three percentage points nationally and by just one percent in battleground states.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"One reason this race is not just so tight but doesn't move very much is that each camp, Harris voters, Trump voters, not only disagree on what should be, but also have very different views on what is today.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And these differences, majority two-thirds of Trump voters feel that hurricane relief funds have not been going to people impacted by the hurricane.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But nine out of ten Harris voters say that they are.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So Jake, let me begin with you, the Trump campaign this morning.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's coming back towards Philadelphia, where Republicans have been outspent in the state, though a ton of money has been going into Pennsylvania politics this cycle.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris comes off of a weekend where Donald Trump was in Colorado and California, two states where he is extremely unlikely to win, as we know, Vlad.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But he's making the same argument to them that their lives would improve, same as any of these battleground states, on things like immigration and the economy, if Donald Trump gets reelected.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, Jake Rosen reporting for us from Washington.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Jake, thanks very much, let's bring in Nydia Kavaza, who is now breaking it down for the Harris campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Good morning, Vlad, vice President Harris will be focusing on courting specifically black men throughout this week.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Harris does count with the same level of support among this voting group as Biden did in 2020.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I'm seeing it this morning as well with Vice President Harris unveiling new policy proposals that are also directly targeted at helping black men.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For example, she's also unveiling policies that providing a million loans for black entrepreneurs, national health initiative that is intended to focus on diseases that particularly impact black people.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
All of this is an effort for her campaign to do outreach and to make sure that black voters and especially black men end up turning out to vote in November.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You know how annoying he's going to be now: he's going, they tried to shoot me.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"No, sorry, he just survived getting pew-pewed somewhere in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Mark my words, one, he's going to come out to many men by 50 Cent at his next campaign rally, whether or not 50 Cent clears it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Two, his poll numbers are going to go through the roof and he's going to blame everything on the establishment.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's going to say that they all conspired against him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This was a plot to make sure that America never becomes first again, because his supporters already think he's the second coming of Jesus.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here's another thing I peeped, a lot of y'all are hopping on the same train talking about some God protected President Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Anyways, do we all realize how serious of a situation that was: and I'm talking about people on both sides, the one saying, oh the shooter missed, he only had one job and then you have other people saying, well look at his pose after he got shot.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is at 235 points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"To be clear, Donald Trump could win every single one of those states or Joe Biden could win every single one of those states and have an electoral college win.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
My part two video will be about do I think Trump getting shot at will change public opinion.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So yesterday the entire world witnessed the shooting that happened at the Trump rally in Butler, PA.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Guy the red rub was talking about how you know white people are so quiet at this point because it was a white person who shot at him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he happens to be a black person, the conversation we are having now, or conversation of him getting shot will have changed and there will be more focus on the conversation of the fact that the person will shot at him is a black person, which is absolutely true because we know how these things work.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There's other person talking about how you know serious the situation is and people should just take him more serious.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's another woman in the states talking about how a news page, a blog page was literally making him that what is not by literally a detail in the picture, changing it to black and white just to make it seem that what it's not.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This guy even said the very first time when Trump held his ear that there was no blood on his hand.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is hosting a town hall just outside of Philadelphia in Oaks, while Harris is holding a rally in Erie, which is between Buffalo and Cleveland.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when it comes to crucial battleground states, well, the candidates are effectively even, with Harris up by just one percentage point.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And then after that, switched and voted to form President Trump in 2016 before going back to President Biden in 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's a greater number of votes than the margin that he lost Pennsylvania by in 2020.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Zach, the Harris campaign is unveiling a new agenda aimed at attracting black male voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"According to our polling, black voters overall are supporting Harris at the same rate as they did for Biden in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"VP Harris here is saying to black men who she really needs to turn out, particularly in a place like Philadelphia down the street from where Trump is today.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So don't say I'm not voting for Republican, but I'm not that behind VP Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, perhaps the single biggest lie that Harris told her in the debate on Tuesday, a little bit under the radar, it came toward the end of the night when she said, quote, I've made very clear my position on fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, that's verifiably false, harris has been anything but clear.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And she now claims to love fracking out of nowhere was, but when she was running for president back in 2019, she agreed that a total fracking ban was necessary.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her, in her own words, something that ABC Disney could learn from.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So, yeah, at the debate, Harris tried to claim credit for the Biden administration's increase of fracking leases.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That never happened, just like she never said in 2020, oh, I changed my position on fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Even fake news CNN fact checked her on that.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The Biden-Harris administration has fought a war on American energy production since day one.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And of course, she has her E.V. mandate, don't you want an E.V. mandate: no plastic straws, a reduction in consumption of meat, this is the party that claims they're the party of freedom and they want to provide everything for you and take everything you have.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Kamala Harris has said many times over that she wanted to ban fracking and transition energy workers.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And with Donald Trump's proposal today, look, I know a lot of guys in the energy sector that work in either oil or gas, and they work in 80 hour weeks, sometimes even more.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's a Donald Trump idea.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is how it goes now, and then we have the lies that Trump and his crack team of wing nuts have been spreading.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"For real, this is really happening, donald Trump has pushed us to the point where we can't even agree on the weather.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I don't know, i think maybe she should be partaking in lithium because Donald Trump should be forced to live on an island with all these people.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I've been hearing a lot from Kamala Harris lately.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yesterday, Trump was in Reading, Pennsylvania, where Nurse Fatschett is going all in on these bogus stories about forced gender swaps.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It was a he and comes back a she.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump criticized her for not doing interviews.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now that she's doing them, he's mad that she is.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And he's mad at the media.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's been lashing out at 60 minutes.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He says CBS should have their license revoked for reasons even he hasn't come up with yet.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he's mad at Whoopi Goldberg, who once headlined the showroom at the casino he ran into the ground.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's crazy, he was probably waiting outside Whoopi's dressing room to tell her how great she was after the show.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Instead of the expected stops in swing states, Trump is holding rallies in solidly blue states like California, Colorado, Illinois, and New York, places where he's losing by a margin wider than his pants.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So why is Trump campaigning in California and New York: with states he has about as much chance of winning as he has of winning a BET award instead of the swing states.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That is Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"These Trump flasks, the shot glass, this very patriotic water bottle, this Trump, oh, the American flag hat, made in China, this Trump military jacket, all made in China.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There are Trump earrings.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Trump camouflage oven mitt, the Trump football flask, the Trump pool float, not intended for use as a flotation device, and the Trump needlepoint flag belt.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's like she's absolutely capable to to have that message But what I'm committed to doing is I'm going to keep showing up and letting people understand that it's like hey You know I I stand with with the vice president just like I stood with with Joe Biden throughout all of this and I believe that Kamala Harris is going to prevail on this I really want people to understand I don't have anything different to say between now and 2016 that We all have to understand that it's going to be incredibly close and all of the things that's happened and all the Scandals and everything that hasn't that hasn't have any impact on Trump and here's where we are And now let's just hold hold the line between now and November And it's going to be very close and I do believe we are going to prevail in all of these things is it a pro-democracy Message freedom message is it an economic message that will win, Pennsylvania I know you don't want to give her advice, but you know the state well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This election, Kamala Harris and Erie, Pennsylvania at this hour, making her case on the economy, arguing her policies will help middle class families reaching out to black voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In particular, a key constituency, both campaigns are looking to reach former president Trump after spending the weekend doubling down with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and suggesting he would use the military against his foes tonight, turning to the economy as well.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris, 50 Trump 48 among likely voters, but this election will be decided in the key battleground states where the race is also essentially tied.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Tonight, Science Harris is closing the gap on the economy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump tonight outside Philadelphia is turning to the economy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You've been eaten alive with inflation and all I'm doing is getting you back to even Harris tonight focused on the economy too in Western Pennsylvania, making the case that her policies will help middle America and trying to reach out to black voters, stopping at a black owned business in Erie today.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's upping her outreach to black men in particular, a key constituency for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris also trying to reach out to conservative voters who aren't happy with Trump now agreeing to sit down with Fox News in Pennsylvania later this week.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Part of a blitz of interviews, it comes as she's ramping up the pressure on Trump, questioning his age and mental fitness, challenging him to another debate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris tonight responding, he's talking about that he considers anyone who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will an enemy of our country.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's saying he is saying that he would use the military to go after them.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now this is both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris's 10th visit to Pennsylvania since Harris entered the race showing just how important this state is to both of them.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It was his first event in the Keystone State since the assassination attempt on July 13.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump made comments criticizing Biden-Harris policies, focusing on the border and public safety.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They are letting horrible people into our country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They are poisoning our country by contrast.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump also spoke about his near assassination and held a moment of silence in memory of Cory Comparatori, the man who was shot and killed at the Butler rally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump and two others were also injured in the shooting.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's one of the reasons I'm here to support him and let everyone know we won't be intimidated.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The visit comes at a time when most polls show the race between him and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris remains tight.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Harris and her future running mate will travel together across the country next week, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump Questions Harris' Race in NABJ Interview On Wednesday, Trump's interview at the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago began with a controversial start when he falsely questioned Vice President Kamala Harris' race.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"ABC News senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott, Fox News host Harris Faulkner, and semaphore political reporter Katia Goba interviewed Trump on stage at the event.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump began, when Scott from ABC asked him to answer her question, Trump responded.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The former president continued mocking Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And when asked about Republican comments that she is a DEI hire, Trump deflected the conversation and asked the journalists to define DEI, which she did repeatedly.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump also appeared to question Harris's race.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I didn't know she was black until a few years ago when she became black and now wants to be known as black.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So I don't know, is she Indian or is she black: trump said Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Fox News polls released last week showed Harris and Trump statistically tied in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin improvements over Biden's position in all three states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris matched him among voters 65 and older and saw support from white voters without a college degree rise to 41 percent from April.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Both Harris and Walz brought their unique voices and experiences to connect with Pennsylvanians on issues that hit close to home.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"From education to the economy, their message resonated with voters eager for leadership and a vision for a brighter tomorrow.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris and Walz, both rising stars in the Democratic Party, brought their A-game to connect with voters from all walks of life.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The energy surrounding Harris and Walz's visit was palpable, underscoring the high stakes of the upcoming election.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Together, Harris and Walz present a powerful combination of experience, perspective, and vision.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris, with her deep understanding of national policy and her ability to navigate complex issues, brings a comprehensive approach to governing.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris, known for his common sense approach and his commitment to bipartisanship, adds a pragmatic and relatable element to their message.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Tariffs aren't unique to President Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's part of the problem with Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Sabrina, this brings up an interesting point, because when you talk to Trump, folks, as I do and I know you do, all of us do at this table, it will say, look, she doesn't answer the questions put to her.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And the reality is, when you talk to then Harris campaign folks, they'll bring up, well, does he really answer the question, does he really get into the nuts and bolts of what exactly he would do in terms of the economy: but the fact is, Trump is a known commodity.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris isn't, and the polling data shows that people are less certain about what she is or what her intentions are or what her sort of foundational principles are.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Just like or like Trump, people have a pretty good sense of those.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She needs to be showing that she takes these issues seriously.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And part of her messaging on the economy has been sort of leaning into a personal appeal as well, talking about, well, I can actually provide for you because I understand you and her talking about coming up in the middle class and really understanding workers and understanding that struggle in a way that Donald Trump doesn't.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And we do see that from when she joined the race, she has improved significantly on the economy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He's still leading, but the gap has narrowed.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The gap has narrowed, which is a positive for her, and what what her campaign is saying is the more she talks about it, the better she is doing on this and more so that you talk to voters and they're becoming increasingly familiar with her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But there is still that doubt because in part, I mean, Kamala Harris has a background as a politician, as a prosecutor.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And Donald Trump does have this branding that has worked well for him of this businessman, this successful businessman persona that can run this country like a business.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think definitely is why the race is so close and why Trump is running so neck and neck with Harris.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that is still that perception that he understands and that he is actually going to improve the economy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Harris campaign has been in Georgia, I think three of the last four days.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They've got internal polling data now that says they might even be tied.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Talk about the Harris campaign now might be tied with Donald Trump in Georgia.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But keep in mind, Donald Trump, he says he has agreed to the rules that the network is carrying, that the television network has laid out.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Harris team has not committed to that yet.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They're fighting still, Laura, over whether or not the microphones will be turned off when it is no longer the candidate's time to speak.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This was part of the deal that the Trump team reached with the Biden team.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It was the original terms of the original debate going back about two months now, and the Trump team wants it to continue.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Harris team is now saying that they want the microphones on all of the time because they think it makes Donald Trump look bad.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They have not agreed to that yet, so there's no formal agreement in place.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's not the point, i'm just trying to outline Trump's path to 270 given like the main six toss-up States that we've been talking about and given some of the data that we saw from the primary Democrats were in serious trouble regarding energy for Biden in Georgia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Trump is up big in the polls in Georgia.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's up big in the polls in Nevada as well and Wisconsin seems like that first domino to fall in the rust belt.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So you can give that to Trump as well if you're trying to orchestrate his path to victory here doesn't seem like he's at risk of losing any single state that he won in 2020.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That is what this election is going to come down to now, keep in mind Trump needs to win one of them.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's nearing 50 percent and then the Emerson poll trumps up by four in Pennsylvania in the Fox News poll.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's up by two and that's very telling because that poll was actually accurate in the midterms.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's close to 50 and it was an accurate poll.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You could argue that maybe the Philly suburbs could get bluer, but still there's a demographic floor for Donald Trump because even in those counties, there's a sizable portion of the population that is white working class.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, neither does Trump at this point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that really speaks volumes, even though Donald Trump was getting outspent in the primary in a lot of places.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He did not put as much effort into it as a lot of these other candidates who are basically vying for second did and Trump won at the end of the day.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He never led the polls in really any of these states going back to 2016 or 2020.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So the fact that he's leading in nearly every single poll should tell you there is some kind of a shift and you could talk about the midterms and polls, whatever.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's leading in every swing state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's up in the polls in Wisconsin, which is unheard of because he always outperforms them by about six and Biden's the incumbent president at 45.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is beating Biden in the state of Wisconsin.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And it's possible the third party candidates in the mix are going to help him out.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, he can get 48, 49 percent and still win the state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He has a very high floor.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Even if you want to say his ceiling is low, still Arizona is not a state that Donald Trump is guaranteed to lose, even if it does seem like it's moved away from Republicans in recent years.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he leads by three and a half points and we could look into this further.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's not like he's leading it just in Trafalgar or Rasmussen or like insider advantage with some right leading pollster that ended up being wrong in 2022.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's leading the polls in Quinnipiac.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's leading polls and pollsters that are very hostile to Republicans and that are very hostile to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But he's at 48 in Michigan.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It turns out half of them are going to go for Biden, but Trump still leads the poll by three, which confirms what I'm saying that half of Haley supporters were never Republicans.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It never was, he won every county in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Those were the counties that he was running up the score in even in suburban counties that happen to be more Republican because yes, those do exist.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He did very very well in Macomb County and I think that's a very good sign for things to come in Michigan and it shows that Biden doesn't have a lot of support in the key places that he needs to go out there and win in order to win this election.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So if you do the math on all the polls, Trump is in a very good position.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You have to defend the main six, he's leading in them.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yes, he has to go on offense technically because he's flipping these states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But is he favored in all of them: yes.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He has to play, you know, defense but also offense at the same time because you need to protect your lead in these places.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Even Hawaii has entered the mix for some reason and I'm not saying Trump can't dabble in some of these states from time to time.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's in a very, very good position.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Do I think he's going to hold every state that he took in 2020: absolutely.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, Donald Trump is at least a two to one favorite in all objectivity.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, what do you make of that: i don't believe her I Don't believe her because you can't change your mind just because you want to be the president fracking is an issue Whether it's Pennsylvania or anyplace else in the country.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"All right, the cost of gas, yeah food housing It's out of control and I don't see any end in sight unless there is a change Oh again you guys You They're gonna have to like rig something up for the first to help to help this ticket Everybody knows we need to change the leadership Some people are just Trump deranged they they're anti-Trump Trump haters, but even they know we need to change the leadership But Trump hurt their feelings But there's tons of people that got their feelings hurt by Trump that are on the Trump train Who Better would bet will better handle the economy before the debate and after the debate look at those numbers We Need common sense back man right now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's plus three for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So in terms of margin, this is probably the largest margin we've actually seen in favor of Kamala Harris in a while.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So I think Trump has a really high floor, but a very low ceiling.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He wasn't even able to crack 47 in the head to head in 2020.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm not exactly sure how he stacks up as a candidate now, compared to then he was much stronger in 2020 than he was in 2016.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"His favorables were far higher, and I think it's because the economy did well under his presidency.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But I think, you know, his floor in the Rust Belt states is probably going to be around 47 to 48 as opposed to, you know, a ceiling of 46, right: so his ceiling is probably somewhere around 49 is probably his like absolute ceiling.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So I think they're underestimating his support by probably two to 3% in this situation.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It was just Trump way overperformed his numbers by 3%.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's just that his numbers are usually fake in the wrong direction for you.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's not cracking 50 in this poll.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And it looks like it's actually turned in favor of Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania for the first time very, very slightly.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This is pretty highly unlikely, the idea that Trump is going to get 50% in any of the swing states that are not faux swing states like Texas or Florida, I guess are those faux swing states are not really swing states that we have the seven, right: the idea he'll be able to crack 50 in any of them is pretty low odds, I would say.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So you could see Kamala Harris kind of barely hanging on with like this point seven point eight lead.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The only thing that would give you pause is the people that Trump picks are always really weak and he's a lot stronger than them.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And so I personally am definitely very afraid of like the Trump overperformance because he always overperforms by two or three.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like, for example, for the national polls, if you do like F of P equals 46 because that's what I think he's going to get.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Put in whatever P you want, whatever his polling number is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The only thing is only caveat is I hope it doesn't end up being correct because Trump is a stronger pollster, a stronger candidate.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris likely to pick Pennsylvania Gov. Shapiro for Veep prediction market, say.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The Fed will cut rates fast and hard in September, say betters U.S. vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
In prediction markets show a clear consensus on whom she'll pick.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris gains on Trump, the last few weeks of prediction market sentiment and polling data show that the US presidential race was less of a test of Donald Trump's popularity and more of an expression of incumbent Joe Biden's unpopularity.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Polls indicate Harris has effectively closed the gap with Trump and is now tied in polling aggregator 538 feet averages.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris has the same momentum in prediction markets but hasn't yet closed the gap.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Pollings average which currently has Trump at 47.7% versus Harris at 46.9%.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Markets that measure a second order effect of Harris's surge are also feeling an effect while a balance of power contracts still has a Republican sweep as the highest probability outcome at 30%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Likewise, another contract that asks if Trump will win every swing state is down 4 percentage points in the last week and 35 percentage points in the last month since Biden's gaffered in performance debating Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The market is waiting for the first Trump-Harris debate to be confirmed, an event that could certainly move markets.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump's camp has said that a debate with Harris scheduled for Sept. 10 on ABC has been terminated with Biden's departure and instead proposed a debate a few days earlier on Republican friendly Fox News complete with a full arena audience.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So far the Harris campaign has said no and the market agrees that she won't show up pricing in a 37% chance of it happening before October.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's what he's looking for, for four straight years, Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails and insane asylums and the worst mental institutions anywhere in the world, not South America, all over the world.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is losing ground to Donald Trump with less than three weeks to go for election day.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"According to many of the new polls, Harris' lead over Trump has narrowed or vanished completely.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Nevada has 6, while the leads have changed hands, neither Trump or Harris are in a strong footing in any of these swing states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Democrats are a worried lot because Kamala Harris' numbers appear to be declining.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But what's making Democrats really worried is that Harris was leading by two or three points in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin since the start of August.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But now the polls show that the race has tightened and Trump is closing the gap.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
All three states had been Democratic strongholds before Trump turned them red on his path to winning the presidency in 2016.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You heard his words coming from him.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's talking about the enemy within Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He's talking about the enemy within our country, Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's talking about that he considers anyone who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will an enemy of our country.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's saying that he would use the military to go after them.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Think about this, and we know who he would target.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And we know who he would target because he has attacked them before.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Journalists whose stories he doesn't like.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is among the reasons I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"After getting a big summertime boost, Harris is now grappling with a massive gender gap with Trump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is a 78 year old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he wrote down his golden escalator nine years ago.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Kamala Harris stepped in, democratic enthusiasm went up.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But now the Biden-Harris administration's record appears to be dragging her down.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's what Kamala is going to do, she's been loyal so far but she's going to cut her own path.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Women voters trust Harris more than Trump and abortion is one of the top issues in this election.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump has managed to bounce back in the last two weeks.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Polls show that the former president has erased Kamala Harris' gains in the key battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and even Nevada.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And he's convincingly ahead in both North Carolina and Georgia.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
A key reason for Trump's resurgence could be his increasingly dark language about immigrants in the United States.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's message appears to be resonating with suburban voters in particular.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In fact, Trump is now so confident of victory that he has begun moving beyond the battleground states to stage rallies in democratic strongholds like California.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump's most efficient path to 270 electoral college votes would be to win the Sun Belt swing states of North Carolina and Georgia and flip Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's where I think you see a stark contrast, right, kamala Harris talking about cutting childcare costs, right: having a childcare tax credit.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's talking about investing in small businesses, putting money into small businesses and cutting taxes.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Former President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail with a fiery rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, reigniting his base with his signature rhetoric and promises.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The event, held on August 1, 2024, was Trump's first appearance in the state since a harrowing incident at a previous rally, which had left many supporters concerned for his safety.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump addressed the incident directly, expressing gratitude for his survival and his ability to continue speaking to his supporters, emphasizing the importance of resilience and determination in the face of adversity.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The rally, held indoors at the state capitol's New Holland Arena, marked a departure from the campaign's usual outdoor gatherings, providing a more controlled environment for the enthusiastic crowd that had gathered to hear him speak.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The crowd was a vast sea of red, white and blue, with enthusiastic attendees proudly sporting Make America Great Again hats and energetically waving Trump flags.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The enthusiasm was palpable, a testament to Trump's enduring popularity among his loyal base.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Many attendees had traveled from neighboring states eager to hear Trump speak and show their unwavering support.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Security was exceptionally tight at the rally, reflecting the heightened tensions following the recent attempt on Trump's life.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The heightened security measures underscored the volatile political climate and the very real concerns surrounding Trump's safety.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Section 4 â€“ Harris in the Crosshairs Trump didn't hold back during his speech, launching scathing attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He criticized her record on immigration crime and gun control, accusing her of failing the American people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's attacks on Harris drew mixed reactions from the crowd, with some cheering enthusiastically while others remained silent.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's narrow victory in the state in 2016, followed by his loss to Biden in 2020, highlights the state's importance in determining the outcome of presidential elections.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Next Quinnipiac in an August LV poll had Harris leading Trump 47-50.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In the immediate aftermath of the debate though they found Trump losing a point to hit 46 while Harris gained 1 to hit 51, a net gain of 2 for the Vice President.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
For the Hill Emerson last time we saw that Harris had gained 2 points over where President Biden had stood and found the race in late August tied at 48.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Also checking in with another previous pollster, previously the NYTCN College likely voter polling in early August had Harris improving substantially over Biden with a race standing at 46-50 in her favor.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Next Rasmussen had an LV poll in mid August which had Trump narrowly leading Harris 47-46.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However their next poll switched to an LV model had Trump gaining 4 points to hit 48 while Harris gained 7 to hit 48 as well for another tied race, a net gain of 3 for Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Finally in early March Susquehanna had Biden leading Trump 50-45.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However their recent poll in mid September had Trump gaining a single point to hit 46 while Harris dropped 4 to tie him at 46, another tie, a net gain of 5 for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So we have a new poll that came out from one of the most left-leaning pollsters in the country, NPR Marist, out of the state of Pennsylvania, and Donald Trump leads.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is post-conviction, he leads across the board.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He leads with independence.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He leads with enthusiastic voters, not so enthusiastic voters, and he leads, period.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He leads by two in Pennsylvania, and you have third-party candidates that are polled in the mix, but these are pretty reasonable numbers.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If Donald Trump wins this state, it is likely game over.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he wins it, you know, we have five months to go, but things are not looking good for Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump has been convicted of a felony.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so far, it is indeed bouncing off, and Donald Trump's influence in many ways is actually growing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's like, how is Trump done: you had not even 60,000 voters turnout in this district.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You look at a county like Monroe County, there was like, you know, Trump got 5,000 votes there in 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You got like, what, 10% of his voter base.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump didn't even endorse this guy either.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Trump, in terms of the primary in Ohio, did extraordinarily well.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Same poll has Trump up seven.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, you know, Trump probably wins the state by double digits.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump flipped it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But just very low turnout overall, no Trump presence or endorsement, so anyone trying to extrapolate what it means for November is just talking out of their ass.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And you see Trump's in-door seat, Mark Burns.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump, I think, stayed out of the Timmons race in 22, but then he endorsed Timmons this time around.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But again, I don't know what's going on with the intel because Trump's endorsements for a while are really improving.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But overall, it was a good night for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Is Kamala Harris going to be the next president of the United States of America: for someone who has, um, you know, sort of claims to be doing good, but actually he's not, you know, he is tearing down the fabric of society.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Hear me when I say that Donald Trump wants you to have a lousy Christmas.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump, donald Trump is the Grinch that wants to steal your Christmas.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's what Donald Trump is going to do.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Which is exactly why we need Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States of America.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Is Kamala Harris going to be the next president of the United States of America: thank you everybody, I appreciate it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And some people are considering this a flip-flop, but Harris is saying that this is simply aligning her with the Biden administration, which also did not call for banning fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that includes the power plant rule that came out in April, which would end the use of new natural gas power plants, unless they eliminate all their emissions, which is pretty much impossible.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So limit the use of natural gas in our power sector over the next few decades, they also put in place a temporary halt in the export of liquefied natural gas.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They're considered either red, meaning they'll vote for a Republican, or blue.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They're more likely to vote for a Democrat.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There are seven states that are considered swing states, meaning they could swing either way and have done so in the past few elections.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They've gone back and forth.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We also call them battleground states.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It has 19 electoral votes, and it is among the states that she would need to have to get to 270 electoral votes.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris is likely to win Philadelphia and some of those suburbs, and also Pittsburgh, perhaps, but the very far outer rings, that's where she's less likely to do well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's an uphill battle for her there, but she at least keeps herself in the game by saying I'm not going to ban fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So that was a very important statement for her to make, former President Trump is doing what many people say the president should do in a situation like this, which is bring up the record of the opponent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And so he's talking about Harris's record in the White House and the Biden-Harris record of trying to stop the use of fossil fuels and how that's associated with higher energy prices.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And also he's been talking about her flip-flopping.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"For example, he'll say, well, she said, I'm going to ban fracking.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So he doesn't say I'm going to ban, he doesn't say I was going to ban fracking.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's just bringing up her past statements.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And they're recent enough that that's fair game if he wants to talk about when she was a proponent of ending fracking.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he can keep doing that, i think that's a successful way to go after your opponent, is to talk about their record.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And she is actually changing her mind on a lot of issues that matter to battleground state voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that's why President Trump is trying to talk about it as Kamala Harris flip-flopping and that she can't be trusted on the issue, but also looking at how the Biden-Harris administration has treated the energy industry over the past three and a half years, you know, explicitly moving to end fossil fuels, which of course we know is going to play a huge role in the natural gas industry in the United States.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Recently the poll in Nebraska's second congressional district shows him up there, i don't know if that's going to hold.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Doesn't mean that their track record is awful and Trump is basically outside the margin of error for victory in the state, which is a very good sign, 49% in any poll that is a very good position to be in.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But also you have a pollster that had Donald Trump trailing the last poll called the Muhlenberg College poll.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So the fact that Trump is polling above Biden in Pennsylvania, when Biden's the incumbent, you'd have to say is a good sign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, it is true that maybe all the polls this time don't underestimate Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump in a lot of the Western Pennsylvania counties sees saw gains even in 2020, despite losing ground nationwide and losing ground in the state as a whole.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Probably not, and even then you look at some of these places really comes down to can Trump reverse some of the home region effect of Biden: i mean, seems like the novelty you could say is worn off.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, you know, it's not like it's proof that Donald Trump's going to be in a lot of trouble, especially because spending even if he gets outspent, it's a presidential year, you know, high propensity in general.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's up in every swing state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"They are one of the most liberal polls ever, but it's impossible that Donald Trump is tied nationwide in Quinnipiac.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump won by eight, and Pennsylvania, they underestimated Trump by over five.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And they're not really the strongest pollster, period.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because like I said, I'm not saying Trump's not the favorite.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's what it comes down to, and in terms of turnout, Donald Trump, you got to get that turnout operation going.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's case in New York is falling apart.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Even if he still ends up getting convicted, i don't think it's going to hurt him at this point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
His case in Florida is basically out the window.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But if you had Trump's voter base up and you give give all the Haley voters to bite, I'm not sure.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Am I saying Trump's going to win it by 21 points: honestly, I think he's going to win it by around 20.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He could win by 21 but still like to say that this proves that Donald Trump is Jover, you know by that logic.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He technically did better than Biden and Haley combined in the state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It was a mix of several things but Trump is still breaking records with the zombie vote and he technically does it again in Indiana.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But apparently it's over for him despite the fact that Indiana is like an open primary and Biden's not really getting a lot of votes.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, that's exactly the result that you get but still Donald Trump is fine.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's up in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's up in most polls in Wisconsin.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Exactly two days ago, I shared the last 14 polls in Pennsylvania, where Kamala Harris won a big victory.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris received 48% of the vote and Donald Trump, 51%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump was three points ahead of Harris in this poll.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris received 45% of the vote and Donald Trump, 48%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump has perfectly managed to get the most votes in the polls so far and has taken a solid step towards the presidency.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote while Donald Trump received 50%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump finished one point ahead of Harris in this poll.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's why Trump's excellent showing in the latest polls is an important step towards the presidency.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now, for those who haven't seen it, let's watch the results of the polls, in which Kamala Harris did very well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 48% of the vote and Donald Trump 46%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania

Harris finished five points ahead of Trump in this poll.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's why Harris's excellent showing in the latest polls is an important step towards the presidency.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yo, yo, what's up guys: i'm about to take you through Donald Trump hood.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is Donald Trump's hood right here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Show you all the Donald Trump stuff, ain't nobody here voting for Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There's a Trump sign.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let's see, this is Trump's hood.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There's some Trump signs over there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump fans, look at that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look at that, more Trump stuff, this is Trump's hood guys.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look at that, this person's really a Trump fan, look at all that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is Trump's hood.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's, that's right, this is Trump's hood, right: this is Trump's hood.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump, why you voting for Trump, do you love him, but you rather Trump than Harris, huh: yeah.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, this is Trump's hood.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This beautiful dog, look at this beautiful dog, this beautiful Trump dog, hi, Nola, are you a good girl: yeah, she's a good girl.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Three cheers for Donald Trump, all right, bye, all right, see you, Brian.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"See that, that Kathy right there, are you doing, are you both with Donald Trump to say you are you voted for Donald Trump, i said, I said, are you voting for Donald Trump, are you voting for Donald Trump: yeah.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's what I make, i make my Donald Trump video.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm having fun with this Trump's hood.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm calling this Trump's hood.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, all right, guys, little beautiful mountains, this is Trump's hood right here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let me show you all the Trump signs, all the Trump stuff around here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We got Trump trash cans.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There was one Harris waltz.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I see one little one, i see one Harris waltz.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump Vance, look at all this, trump low prices, trump Vance, it's amazing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is in a strong position to win the key swing state of Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And today we have to talk about the 2024 presidential election because Donald Trump's in a strong position to win the key swing state of Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, that's right, despite all the dooming surrounding Pennsylvania, Trump is in a very good position to win it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, does that mean he's going to win Pennsylvania by 15 points, or I'm saying he's the clear favorite: no, but I would argue as of now, Donald Trump is the favorite in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It may not be by 30 points, but I would argue that Trump is right now the favorite in the Commonwealth.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Again, that doesn't mean it's by some huge margin, but I would argue as of now, he is the favorite to win Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Therefore, he's probably the favorite to win the presidency.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's why everyone still believes that Harris is the clear favorite in Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, I'm not saying it's impossible for Harris to win Pennsylvania, but the only polls that have are winning as of now are Bloomberg, which is by born in Consult and Quinnipiac.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Even in that scenario, Harris has a much smaller lead in Pennsylvania than Biden did, that Clinton did.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If the same error occurs, not even that, just a two point miss, not a three point miss, that's still a Trump win.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We just got to see what happens, maybe by some miracle at the end of September, Harris is up by 15 points in Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I guess that's possible, but Harris is up by point five and that's with two big outliers.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I would rather be in Trump's position right now than Harris's, because if you're Trump, well, a point miss is kind of expected, especially with two big outliers like Quinnipiac, like Bloomberg, inflating Harris's margin.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Welcome back to America Decides and CBS News coverage of the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, now what did the voters think about tonight: cBS's Nicole Killian is in Bucks County, Pennsylvania with a focus group and Nicole we are all so interested to hear what these voters thought about the candidates performances.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Definitely Kamala Harris, i would say Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump, trump, kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What were your thoughts: donald Trump made a strong closing statement by saying why didn't they do all the things that she's proposing during the three and a half years that they've been in office and Biden did this entire moderate stance back in 2020 and she's trying to do it again 2024 but she didn't talk about her policy changes between 2020 and 2024.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I mean you're someone who said that you support Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
How do you respond to that: you know I think that Kamala has a lot of good plans for the future and I think that since she wasn't the one that was mainly in charge you know even though she is vice president there is Congress and there is checks and balances so like she can't do everything I think that with her being more empowered president I think that she would be able to do a better job.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
A lot of the big issues for me were the fact that Kamala is a politician and the debate is a politician's game and I believe that she definitely has a better convincing point for who to vote for.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Is there anything you didn't hear tonight that you wanted to hear, eddie: well I wanted to hear as I said at the beginning I wanted to hear honest actual policy proposals and I wanted to hear the truth and I got some honest policy proposals but they all came from Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"All I heard from Donald Trump was more angry vilification of immigrants, more goofy conspiracy theories about nine-month abortions and eating your neighbor's cat and those aren't policy proposals and I really was looking for something like that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"According to brand new data, it appears that Donald Trump's gonna get a huge victory in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, that's right, despite what Democrats may claim about the current state of the race and how Harris is actually up by 50 points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Oh, it's a Trump lead on the RCP average.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, trump is up in the RCP average by just under half a point despite Bloomberg, despite Quinnipiac, despite the New York Times posting bull shit.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're the only pollsters right now that have Harris winning Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Every other pollster, Emerson, Insider Advantage, Trafalgar, Wall Street Journal, Atlas Intel, Rasmussen, everyone is showing Trump is up in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But if it wasn't for that one poll, Trump right now in the RCP average more than likely would be up by like a point, maybe two.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And in 2020, you can argue the only reason that the RCP average was anywhere close to being accurate, actually was spot on, was because of Susquehanna, Trafalgar, insider advantage, finding very small Trump leads.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yet right now, Trump's up by just under half a point, and that's with some big outliers.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Everyone else found a tide race or a Trump lead except three shitty pollsters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The only ones when everyone else is saying Trump's up in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, more than likely Trump is up in Pennsylvania right now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yet right now in the RCP average, despite being down by five points in 2020, being down by seven points in 2016, Trump is leading the RCP average.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But I find that so unlikely just for the simple fact it hasn't happened in Pennsylvania in 2020 or 2016, when Trump's on the ballot every year.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Is it possible the polls are actually spot on or in fact understate Harris a little bit: yeah.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I just don't think you're going to see Harris Harris point miss.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If that really does happen, it's Harris not going to win Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Maybe the Harris campaign will pick it up in a week or so.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She is in deep trouble.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But like I said before, this doesn't mean that Harris will for sure win Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I am not saying that, but these numbers right now are so bad for her that how could anyone say as of now, Harris is the clear favorite in Pennsylvania: no, Trump right now is the favorite.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Is it by 80 points: no, but I would say it's clear as day that Trump is a favorite.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Thank you, starting with today's first poll, conducted by Fabrizio, Lee, and Associates between July 29th and August 1st, with 600 likely voters, Harris received 48% of the vote, while Trump also received 48%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In the second poll, on the same dates, and also conducted by Fabrizio, Lee, and Associates with different 600 likely voters, Harris received 45% of the vote, while Trump also received 45%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Going forward to the third poll, from July 31st to August 3rd, which is conducted by Redfield and Wilton Strategies, with 743 likely voters, Harris received 44% of the vote, while Donald Trump received 46%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Harris lost the poll by two points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Moving to the fourth poll from August 6th to 8th, conducted by Trafalgar Group, with 1,078 likely voters, Harris received 44% of the vote, while Trump received 46%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Trump won the poll by two points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In the fifth poll, conducted by the New York Times and Siena College from August 6th to 9th, with 693 registered voters, Harris received 49% of the vote, while Trump received 46%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris leads the poll by three points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Moving forward to the sixth poll, on the same, which was also conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, with different with 693 likely voters, Harris received 50% of the vote, while Trump received 46%, and Harris leads the poll by four points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In the seventh poll, from August 6th to 9th, which was also conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, with different with 693 registered voters, Harris received 45% of the vote, while Trump received 43%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Again, Harris won the poll by two points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In today's final poll, on the same which was also conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, with different with 693 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 44%, and Trump lost the poll by two points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump won in two polls, but Harris gained a slight edge in four polls.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"As Kamala Harris courts voters in Pennsylvania, black Greek life is thrust into the spotlight.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Ms. Harris is an active member of AKA, the oldest Greek letter organization established by African-American college-educated women, and has said the organization changed her life.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Since taking office as vice president, she's attended numerous Divine Nine engagements, including her own sororities boule on July 10.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She said at the event in Dallas, including of course in 2020 when during the height of a pandemic, you helped elect Joe Biden president of the United States and me as the first woman elected vice president of the United States.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And just days after Ms. Harris moved to the top of the presidential ticket this summer, every divine nine president pledged in a joint statement to meet this critical moment in history with an unprecedented voter registration, education, and mobilization coordinated campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Ms. Harris ties to the coalition might also prove to be a way to re energize black male voters, who Republicans have increasingly begun to view as an attainable slice of the electorate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"However, she said recent voting initiatives within the divine nine have further strengthened bonds between members, including men.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"All of us members are cheering for Kamala in our own organizations and capacities the same way, she said.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Jabari Michael Kensu, a Kappa Alpha Psi alum chapter member and a pit graduate, echoed her sentiment.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"We're all going to rally together behind her to support her because there's power in the black vote, power in the black community in America, he said, it drives the economy, it drives culture, and it should drive the election.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It shows Donald Trump defeating Kamala Harris by 3 percentage points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is huge, seeing that the last two polls, three polls, et cetera, two polls were three, as you know, three point wins for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So what this is possibly saying is we're seeing Kamala Harris polls getting more skewed up.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
You could say that some of these polls here have registered these two polls that showed Kamala Harris out of the margin of error for her victory.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Obviously, Donald Trump, the victor in this said election by I would say tomorrow.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So this is what I'm thinking, obviously Donald Trump is going to gain some.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Obviously, things are changing here, you're seeing more Trump polls coming in, which is obviously great.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So what would a the question is, I'm going to bring it up again.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What would a Harris point is: so what would a the question is, I'm going to bring it up again.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
What would a Harris point five victory look like: so let's see.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Connell Harris to win the state of Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And this looks like a Harris point.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, even if I move this, it's still a Trump win.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"OK, now it's a Harris point eight.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is Harris point seven.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But ideally we know real real clear politics is already having a Trump win.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"A zero point three percent point Trump win, but what do you guys think: let me know down below and as always, I'll see you all in the next political episode.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He was able to emerge defiantly and continue on in the campaign.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This place has certainly become an important symbolic location for Trump supporters around the country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump spent the beginning of his rally talking about the assassination attempt in very somber terms.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know that, we heard Trump talk about many of the themes that he's touched on over the years.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The need for stronger immigration reforms, some of the economic concerns that he has on trade and inflation and he was very critical obviously of Kamala Harris's policies and what he believes she would bring to the country if she's elected president.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The other day I saw her get up and say we will do this, we will do that, we're gonna, why didn't they do it four years ago, why didn't they do it: the damage is so bad and so it's been done.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump called on Elon Musk to join him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is a much different race than what President Trump faced when he was here in July.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
At the time he had just had his debate with President Biden that had been very successful from the Trump campaign standpoint.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Weeks after the assassination attempt President Biden decided not to run for reelection and so as a result Trump now faces Vice President Kamala Harris.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Harris campaign is heavily focused around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and the suburbs around those cities.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Whereas the Trump campaign is really focused on increasing turnout in rural communities around the state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They feel like that was the key part of his success here in the Keystone State in 2016 and it's something they want to be able to replicate this time.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Irrefutable proof that what Donald Trump says is the truth.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Random people at his rallies screaming that they agree with him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You can't argue with that, charleroi, the town that Trump references in that clip, is a town in southwestern Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Despite what Trump and the smattering of people in his audience who were supposedly from Charleroi say, the effect of the Haitian immigrants on the town of Charleroi has been far from disastrous.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This from the New Republic, Trump's hateful new rants at rally are harshly debunked by town leader.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The borough manager isn't the only Pennsylvania official speaking out against Trump's attacks on the Haitian community in Charleroi.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"From NBC News, local Republicans reject Trump's claims about Haitian immigrants in their towns.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That all sounds wonderful and like the sort of thing that you would expect and hope that any elected official would say in response to the kind of rhetoric being promoted by Trump and J.D. Vance, but before you praise State Senator Bartolotta too much, keep in mind that she is not only a Republican, even after the things he said about Charleroi and its good, hardworking people who are doing their best to take care of their families, she's also still a Trump supporter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Another local official, also a Republican, also infuriatingly still a Trump supporter, laid out the situation very succinctly.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Publicly announce that you are going to vote for Kamala Harris, and encourage everyone else to do the same.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Because while I appreciate that you've been willing to speak out against the lies being spewed by Donald Trump, the fact that you're still voting for him makes your defense of your Haitian constituents ring pretty hollow.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"As Trump and Vance have demonstrated of late, words mean things.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And right now your message is, what Donald Trump says about our Haitian residents isn't true and isn't fair, but I'm still going to vote for him because he probably just needs to get to know us better.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then he'll stop saying these things.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Sure, and if Benjamin Netanyahu would just visit Gaza and meet the people there, he'd stop what he's doing right away.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If only Andrew Jackson had gotten to know more Cherokee or Chickasaw people, he'd never have signed the Indian Removal Act, right: if you say you care about Haitian immigrants in your community, but you're still voting for Donald Trump, I'm going to question whether you actually care.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because if you say you value human rights, public safety, the truth, but you're willing to set them aside for what you think will be lower taxes and less federal red tape or whatever other benefits you expect to get from a Trump administration versus a Harris administration, if you're willing to set all of those values aside for those things, I don't think you really value those things at all.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But it's actually groceries and it's actually the economy and protecting social security because Donald Trump's doing a whole lot of talking in your state in the Commonwealth about, well, this here play this clip.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump, when he was in Bedminster, made that really horrible statement and said that people who get the Medal of Freedom are better.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And then he had his kind of right wing media with him in Wilkesbury and they tried to clean it up, but he just doubled down on what he said.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He should be condemning this, he served in the Army.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I would hope that he would condemn this, but I haven't heard a word about condemnation.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will win at the national level.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kristen, what was his rally like, how did people respond, what did Trump say: well, in a word, it was crowded.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Trump immediately acknowledged that when he came on the stage Wednesday evening and how he took a jab right at Kamala Harris, you know, as to be expected.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Saying that he didn't need celebrities to pack his rallies.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He also said a lot of other things that you would expect.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He did reflect on the assassination attempt itself.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he spent a lot of time honoring the 50 year old former fire chief that died, Corey Comperatorre.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And my apologies if I've said his name incorrectly.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So he spent a lot of time reflecting on that and saying how appreciative and happy he was to be back in the state and that he would be going back to Butler, although he didn't give a specific date.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"From there, he launched into more of his traditional talking points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He was hitting Kamala Harris hard on immigration, on border policy, on criminal justice.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He also had a lot of time or a lot of fun seemingly to poke at her rehab image over the last couple of weeks since Joe Biden's dropped out.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He said she went from being one of the worst vice presidents in history to Margaret Thatcher.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's right back where he's always been with his inventive name calling and his very, what's the word, you know, it's almost like he's in his own category of politician at this point because he's so biting and entertaining in his own right in a way that just continues to ignite his base and to grow it, quite frankly.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And did he comment at all about potentially who Harris's vice president would be given that he was in Pennsylvania: he didn't mention Shapiro by name, but the odds makers as of Thursday are really pointing to Shapiro as her VP choice.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, he's kind of been in the shortlist for a while now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's a popular governor in a key battleground state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he's also a young Democrat who has ambitions of his own to run for president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So it wouldn't be unusual for him to take this next step.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, he also has some baggage with him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He is very pro-Israel, which may alienate some of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party that has obviously a very anti-Israel stance amid the war in Gaza.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he's also been supportive of school vouchers in the past, and he's obviously not talking a lot about that now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, there is some more credence to the idea that he's the pick because Kamala is launching a battleground state tour in the coming week.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's starting off in Philadelphia and reportedly she will have her running mate with her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It could be could be completely wrong, but, you know, Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who said very plainly that she was not being considered.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A lot of analysts are saying she needs to hold that blue wall in the north, which includes us, Michigan, Wisconsin, some of these these rust belt blue collar states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris has to carry all of those if she wants to win the election.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And given the assassination attempt, sort of the the entire the strengthening of Trump's base and sort of the invigoration into the campaign ever since that attempt, I think that that's something that I said has become very symbolic for the Republican Party.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
How much votes did Trump and Harris get: let's find out together.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 46% of the vote and Donald Trump 45%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris finished one point ahead of Trump in this poll.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote and Donald Trump 45%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 48% of the vote and Donald Trump 49%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 46% of the vote and Donald Trump 48%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump finished two points ahead of Harris in this poll.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote and Donald Trump 51%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 50% of the vote and Donald Trump 47%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris coming in plus six over Trump and plus five guys.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If he loses Pennsylvania, he basically has to win Pennsylvania in order to come up with the victory here.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Otherwise he's got to pick off some really hard to reach states.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris receives 51% among the likely voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's important, people who are polled and say they likely will show up and vote Trump at 45%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In terms of enthusiasm, 70% of likely voters supporting Harris say they are very enthusiastic, which is up from 66% in August.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Favorability ratings 48% favorable opinion of Harris while 43 unfavorable, so she is up in favorability by five points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That is absolutely massive since she was underwater in favorability for all of Donald, for all of Joe Biden's presidency.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So she went from down to plus five, that's a seven point swing and 44% of likely voters had a favorable view of opinion of Donald Trump while 53% have an unfavorable opinion.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Again that magic 45 number for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He is stuck there, seemingly 98% of Democrats back Harris while only 94% of Republicans back Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Guys, if Harris goes on to win Pennsylvania and again, Michigan, this thing is absolutely over and realistically Donald Trump has no path to victory or very few paths to victory just to be clear.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Enthusiasm, 79% of likely voters supporting Harris say they are very enthusiastic about supporting her, 83% say they are very enthusiastic about supporting him.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So again, Trump with the enthusiasm win important for him and favorability, 48% favorable, 47% unfavorable for Harris, 44% for Harris, similar number favorable for Trump and 53 unfavorable for that, looking at Wisconsin, as I felt will be closer and in my opinion, harder to win for Harris and likely win for Trump here, given how close it's been in the past with a large secret Trump vote out there.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And a tremendous amount of undecided and independent voters swinging in Kamala Harris's direction.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And it is a massive, massive swing for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He is okay, the shooter looks like came in from behind.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And again, he's okay.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"As of right now, it looks like Trump is okay.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Secret Service was able to grab him and cover him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now in the meantime, Trump got up.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He had blood all over his face.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he did a fist pump to let the people know that he was going to be okay.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It looks like while he had his head turned, speaking to a screen, he was in fact shot.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is horrible, this is an absolute travesty, a Biden supporter has broken in to the Trump rally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The shooting unfolded as Trump addressed supporters at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Frantic scene took hold as shots rang out, sending Trump supporters streaming from the stands and away from the event.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"My gosh, this would be horrifying, in 10 seconds, Trump was put on the floor by Secret Service and they protected him from the shooter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump hears a shot and he looks and then all of a sudden he grabs his ear and he falls to the ground and the Secret Service rushed in.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He then, after being taken to the ground, stood up, pumped his fists, says, USA, Make America Great Again.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is crazy, let's see here, okay, Secret Service encircled Trump within seconds of the shots being fired and the agency statement is that the former president is safe.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Apologies, i'm just getting this just as soon as you guys are Trump shooter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Oh my gosh, look at that, right there, unbelievable, this guy, nobody is fighting harder for America than Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, I don't know, i don't know if this is the CIA from everything I'm reading that this is a Trump's, excuse me, a Biden supporter, somehow got in with a firearm 10 shots fired.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is in Butler, Pennsylvania with 50,000 supporters at the Trump rally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The last time this happened was President Ronald Reagan, who many have compared Donald Trump to.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let's all pray for the Trump family, and I will be back on later with more updates.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now let me say this, I'm not saying that she can't win this election.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I'm not even sure if she's going to lose Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I don't think that it's a lie to say that over the past two weeks, if she had a lead, she's squandering it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Like, oh man, you know things are bad when Dick Cheney is coming out for Kamala, Karl Rolv is coming out for Kamala, Mitt Romney is coming out for Kamala.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But remember, eight years ago, the left-wing media didn't have any problems pushing Evan McMullen, who was a right-wing third party candidate who hurt Trump, even though Trump still won.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now they're pushing this misinformation campaign that Jill Stein is a Trump agent, and Jill Stein is only running the hurt camel.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That was very pivotal, but I mean, I don't know how true this is, but I look, me personally, I think Trump's probably going to get somewhere around 14% of the black vote.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think he's going to get about 14%.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he gets over 15% of black votes, she's done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm hearing reports about Trump signs scattered all across Philly, especially South Philly.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I can't, I don't, you know, look, man, I don't buy this about that many black people voting Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If Trump gets anything like close, remotely close to 20% of black vote, she is toast, but we'll see.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
President Biden and former President Trump won their respective primaries in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But could last night's vote be trouble for Trump: former UN ambassador Nikki Haley won more than 16 percent of the vote in the Republican contest, even though she's, of course, no longer in the race.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In fact, polls tell us most of them are going to come back to Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's paying attention to Bucks County as well in those collar counties of Philadelphia.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He was just in Newtown, Pennsylvania, having a fundraiser, of course, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Brian Fitzpatrick, it's notable, the Republican from Bucks County, won his primary against a conservative challenger.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Are you seeing across the country some of the Republicans who are supportive of abortion rights being a little bit wary of Trump who nominated people to the Supreme Court who overturned Roe v. Wade: yeah, I think that's going to be a central question of this election because we've seen across the country since the overturning of Roe every time an abortion measure was on the ballot it has passed.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I think the story, if Trump is also elected, as we saw in early 2017, folks from the RNC staffers come in and we're that first wave of staffers.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I think more than anything else, if he's elected this time, there it's going to be staffed with loyalists from the start.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You mentioned the Trump trials.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Is it baked in or the image of Trump every day repeating the kind of salacious details of the Stormy Daniels saga, does that kind of remind those suburban voters reasons why they moved away from Trump in the past election: that's true.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Maybe the gag order in the case will be helpful to Trump if he's not able to talk about those issues.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What about for President Biden, Matt, does he look at these numbers in Pennsylvania, do Democrats look at these numbers and see an opportunity: and should Republicans be worried that Democrats could say to these traditional Republican voters or Brian Fitzpatrick voters in Bucks County, hey, we're here for you.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Is Trump and the Republican party at-largest rapid gains among minority voters: specifically, Hispanics here in South Texas has offset Democratic gains in urban areas here like Dallas and San Antonio.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now here in 2024 we saw Trump make gains against Biden in the crosstabs among voters of color before the president dropped out.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yet now, with Harris headlining the Democratic ticket, we have seen those gains diminish quite a bit.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now if Harris is going to outperform Biden anywhere, it is going to be in a state like Georgia, with a high percentage of African American and young Democratic voters that simply were not energized by Biden's candidacy, to say the least.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But this is another lean GOP poll here for Trump, lifting him up and ahead of Harris now in the race to 270, with 198 electoral votes to 196.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now here in 2024, Florida Atlantic University just released a survey here, showing Trump up 3 points among more than a thousand likely voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump won it by just one percentage point in 2020, but had polled very strongly against Biden this cycle, with an average lead of 4.9% based on 45 polls before the president dropped out.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now with Harris, we have seen one of the strongest leftward shifts here in the nation, as SurveyUSA released a poll with High Point University that his Trump and Harris tied, pulling in 47% of support each among 938 likely voters, surveyed between August 19th and 22nd.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This is not the only poll to come out recently, showing Harris in a tight race.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I should make sure to note here though that both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden led Trump in the final polling averages headed into the 2016 and 2020 elections, before ultimately losing the state to Trump on both occasions.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here in 2024 though, Trump had polled within striking distance, or even ahead of Biden in Virginia at times this cycle.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"These four battlegrounds have voted for the same candidate as one another in almost every modern presidential election, voting blue in the six elections between 1992 and 2012, before Trump then managed to flip Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, each by less than a point, against Hillary Clinton in 2016.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This would be a 3-point overperformance for Harris compared to Biden's winning margin in 2020.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And here on our map, it gets marked down as Safe Democrat adding 10 more electoral votes to the Harris tally.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The latest survey here though, again from Qantas Polls and News, between August 14th and 15th, is Harris leading by 2 points, 46.2% to 44.6%, among 601 registered voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"With Obama states in 2008 and 2012, Trump carried Iowa and Ohio each by margins of around 8 to 9 points in 2016 and in 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that does mean that Trump hits exactly 270 electoral votes now, which would be enough to make him just the second president to serve a non-consecutive term in the White House.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Again, the University of New Hampshire has Harris up 5 points among almost 2000 likely voters, 52% to 47%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That would mark a two-point improvement for Harris relative to Biden's winning margin here in 2020.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"As for the bottom poll, we see Trump expectedly leading Harris by two points, with 51% to 49%, among 701 likely voters surveyed here in late July.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I've always been saying that when Trump is on the ballot, it's gonna be very, very close.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's definitely gonna win big there again, but with relatively few votes there, what's the big idea behind the strategy of trying to cut into his margin in places like Somerset instead of trying to drive up turnout in more populous places where we know Democrats will do well: yeah, well, there's some history to this.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So when Trump is running, I have to expect that it's gonna have that same situation and Trump created in the eighties.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump carried that county by about 2000 votes.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
widening gender gap and for more on the Harris campaign I want to bring in ABC News senior White House correspondent Selena Wang.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So Selena what kind of impact right now is the Harris campaign hoping that having Liz Cheney by her side again will have: well today in these blue wall states Vice President Harris is really going after that narrow sliver of those undecided voters specifically suburban women those more moderate Republicans and independents they're really hoping that former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney is going to make a dent with some of those voters who may be unsure about Vice President Kamala Harris but are also frustrated and tired of Donald Trump and Harris's message to them is that they've got a home within the Democratic Party and Liz Cheney is making the pitch that it's because she's deeply conservative that she's backing Harris she says she's putting the Constitution over her party calling Donald Trump unchecked unstable and dangerous.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think she's really leaning into these issues that impact people personally and then doubling down on whether it's housing or child tax credit those are those are pretty big differences and I don't think that's that's a pejorative towards it there were other issues that were being dealt with and she's her own leader she's got her own path a new way forward.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And when Harris herself was on The View earlier this month when she was asked that very question she said she couldn't think of anything that she would have done differently compared to President Biden but then 30 minutes later into that interview she said she would appoint a Republican in her cabinet but Harris more recently now she's tried to draw a little more distance with President Biden saying that she will be a different president because of who she is her background in her policy focus but still struggling to get really specific and clearly articulate how she'd be different from the president and I can tell you I can I've been talking to some Democrats who say her real vulnerability is on the economy and articulating a clear vision there when so many Americans are frustrated with inflation even though it has been slowing down Kana.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Selena let's talk about some of these election experts that are right now expressing concern for Elon Musk's million dollar raffle right for registered voters in swing states who as Musk puts it have to sign a petition in support of the Constitution to be eligible I know that you asked the White House press secretary about that today what did she say.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump has taken the lead out of the state of Pennsylvania in the real clear politics polling average.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He currently leads in enough states right now to get to 270 electoral votes, which is absolutely huge.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's got the core states that he held in 2020 plus North Carolina so far in his column.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He has a lead in Georgia.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He has a lead in Arizona.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's not enough to get to 70, he needs a rust belt state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But right here right now Donald Trump officially has taken the lead.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You can get it for 1995 the iconic Trump design on the front the inspirational quote on the back and for a limited time you could buy one get one 20% off all t-shirts tank tops and mugs.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He never led down the stretch back in 2016.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is somebody who says I don't want to take this issue to the national level.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So when you look at this and you talk about the state, you see Harris in those teamster polls.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's not to say that Trump didn't win a lot of those voters or hold a lot of those voters from 2020 because he absolutely did.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris is not really able to stop the bleeding.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's probably going to bleed around 5% support, one could say, conventionally, just based on the current state of affairs in the country.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And in terms of the battle of persuasion, in terms of new voters, seems like with the current state of affairs, you could see Donald Trump make a net gain of around, you know, 5% to 6% with that demographic.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if he does that, he's got a sizable advantage in the state of Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When you look at this, he could very well flip a county like Lackawanna County, which is where Scranton is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He almost won it in 2016.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think you will see Donald Trump gain.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think you will see him gain a little bit.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I think he's going to gain with Hispanic significantly, especially among Puerto Ricans in the Philadelphia area, Philadelphia City proper in particular.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He very well can crack 20% of the vote in Philadelphia.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If the margin of error is often in Donald Trump benefits at the end of the day because of that, this is a viable result.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He'd have a sizable lead in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because Donald Trump, John Federman is right.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But it's possible Donald Trump could win Bucks.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He doesn't have to win it to win the state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But if he does win it, it's going to be very difficult to see him losing the state of Pennsylvania when it's all said and done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, Donald Trump was just endorsed by President Duda of Poland.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's their leader.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris is not capturing these people and they will determine the outcome of the state and they will determine potentially the outcome of a couple of these House races and possibly the Senate race as well.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Northeastern Pennsylvania, Harris's prospects are dicier.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And you talk about Northeastern Pennsylvania, but also the Lehigh Valley, where there's a surprising number of Hispanics in places like Reading that she's going to continue to struggle with.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's not going to be able to gain, you know, five, ten points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She might even lose ground in a lot of these suburbs of Philadelphia, depending on the suburb, like the working-class suburbs in Bucks County.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, she will lose ground.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Some of these places in Montgomery, she'll hold the margin.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She might improve marginally, but it's not going to be enough to offset her point of weakness with a lot of these working-class white voters in the state that somebody in a tumultuous time like Joe Biden, he'd probably be able to get enough of them to hold on.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And it does seem as if Harris is in a much weaker position than these individuals.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump also put a Catholic from the Rust Belt on his ticket as well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And hold on to the end, because I'm going to explain why I think the wheels are starting to fall off the Kamala Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And again, for the fourth week in a row, Donald Trump is beating Kamala Harris by two points, 49 percent to 47 percent.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And this is a stunning performance for Donald Trump who in no other election cycle ever even got close to 49 percent.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But we're going to get to that, donald Trump has been winning men by just about upper single digits every single time, 51 to 44 here down slightly among women by four points, roughly tied with 18 to 39 year olds.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In this sample, he's a little bit up.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's roughly tied among middle age voters, but maybe there's some regional up and downs and whatever.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Trump is winning big among older voters here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm happy to see that come together because he's been down and it doesn't make sense to me.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Trump is winning the white vote by five points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump's taking home 25 percent of the black vote.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But he's winning Hispanic 62 percent to 36 percent.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump is solidly beating Kamala Harris by seven points among independent voters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's a fake issue because Donald Trump is not taking our democracy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's literally running for president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He was president in the past and he facilitated a peaceful transfer of power.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris wins 90 percent to 9 percent among MSNBC viewers.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump only wins 80 percent to 18 percent among Fox News viewers.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think that's because there's still a whole cadre of left leaning pollsters that progressively moved Harris up week after week.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But you know, Emerson's Harris plus one Quinnipiac is tied.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They've had Trump up.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They might have Trump up again.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think you're going to see probably Atlas Intel drop another poll and Trafalgar and they're all going to show broadly the same kind of thing as me.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And the numbers that show Harris left or New York Post's using somebody that I'm not sure I think is kind of questionable.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There go if the polling is one point left now, Harris is still up in the national popular vote.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris, again, Kamala Harris is up to now when Hillary Clinton was really up four point five.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is doing two points at least worse than Hillary Clinton was eight years ago.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But our polling showed that Trump was up three in North Carolina.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think he's going to do better than that.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So that is a safe Trump win.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think my polling that we put out the Trump tied in Pennsylvania is to left because of the sample and the internal demographics.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think Trump is winning Pennsylvania right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's ridiculous, so Trump is doing five to seven points better than he was doing in Pennsylvania polling four years ago.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump won this state by almost a point.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think you're going to see a massive Trump outperformance here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump 49, Trump 50, all of a sudden after the debate, though, there's been a ton of Trump buying pressure and Trump is now up to 52% in Pennsylvania and the Democrats.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that puts him up four points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is really the first time in a while he's been meaningfully leaning in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Although we are now tied, trump has been down a point or two.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
If polly market shows Kamala Harris is losing.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
If the polling on real clear politics shows Kamala Harris is losing.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
If the leaked internal polling from the Harris campaign shows that she's losing meaningfully in states like Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Between now and election day, the narrative is going to be that she's loser on top of the strikes on top of now, the federal emergency management efforts in North Carolina.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But with Trump hitting plus two every single week in a row for a month, it doesn't look like the next month is going to be exciting.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm standing in a parking lot in Baltimore where just last week the so-called Blacks for Trump bus appeared hoping to change hearts and minds in a very blue state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Last week, black Republicans visited deep blue Baltimore City on a so-called more money with Trump bus tour, while attendance was low, confidence was not.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You can vote for change, which would be President Trump in a situation.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What does that mean, tell me what do you mean: he's a misogynist.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But now that it's Harris, we feel like she's someone that we'll be able to organize with and potentially work with in D.C. Today, they were preparing people for door knocking, hoping that one on one encounters can change minds.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So it's been very close, all right, now a poll this week by a bipartisan group found that Harris's lead over Trump is 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, and you see Harris at 49 percent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So those Republicans that don't love Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But are if the past is is what we would expect in this case, they will probably end up voting for him in the end.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And part of the reason why you can you can sort of bait Donald Trump into this stuff, whether it's on crowd sizes or something else, it's because Donald Trump is only focused on himself.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so when you entice him that way to talk about himself, instead of talking about the American people and how he's going to help them, it's something that we've come to know is just part of his problem.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's focused on himself.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's not focused on the future of trying to help the American people.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Twice Donald Trump was asked a simple answer in the words of the moderator.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He said, would the war be over if you were president of the United States: he couldn't answer that question.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Kamal responded by saying, well, yeah, it would be over because Donald Trump would just give up.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What we do know, and I thought Kamala Harris prosecuted this case effectively, is that Trump would just give Putin and give Russia exactly what they want and would make that entire region less stable, would put NATO at extraordinary risk, NATO countries and our allies at extraordinary risk.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Kamala Harris made clear that she's going to be an all of the above energy president.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She understands the important role those energy jobs play here in Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And she also, I thought, made a really important point for all of Donald Trump's bluster about energy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You know what: under the Biden-Harris administration, we're producing more domestic energy than ever before in this nation, which strengthens our economy and it strengthens our national security.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I have confidence that she'll continue that.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But under the Joe Biden and Donald Trump matchup, on the day that Joe Biden dropped out of the race, the numbers looked far worse for the Democrats, with Donald Trump at the advantage point of 4.5% in terms of his lead over Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But then came Kamala Harris, and she completely changed everything, not only on the national level, but also in states like Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Today, Kamala Harris leads by one.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Biden, sorry, rather, Trump was up four points against Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But as she had more time to campaign and voters got to know her well and got to see her on the campaign trail in advertisements on social media, her numbers started to increase tremendously.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She went from 44.3% today to now three points higher and 47.6%, in fact, 3.3% higher.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump, however, has lost roughly half a point since that initial dropout.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that is substantial, that is a position where Donald Trump was initially slated to do quite well.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The lead was pretty substantial, that he had room to fall, but that room and that gap had been narrowing and narrowing and narrowing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And now Kamala Harris is losing on the nuclear politics average by just 0.2% nationwide.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
New York Times had Kamala Harris up four points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Quinnipiac University had her up three points, a reduction of one point, but still largely in line with the average there in favor of Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So the 46 to 43 lead here is also very much in line with what we see on Quinnipiac of a 48 versus 45 point lead and then a 50 to 46 lead for Kamala Harris in the New York Times poll.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"One thing is consistent, kamala Harris is either ahead by three or four points, and that maintains the average that now shows Kamala Harris leading in the state of Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that is the problem for Donald Trump, because it would be one thing at the New York Times in a college poll was a fluke and he tried to write it off as such.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
His surrogates and even Hamlet Truth Social have gone after many pollsters over the past three weeks that have shown Kamala Harris in the advantage point in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He re-ups some polls that have been done in battleground states, not necessarily Pennsylvania, but other states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The Fox News poll, for instance, that showed Donald Trump with a one point advantage that is very clearly an outlier based on what we're working with nationally, but still he uplifts it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But beyond that point, there wasn't much else that Donald Trump could really uplift.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And we know that he has a long history of attacking pollsters when he disagrees with the results.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so the New York Times, when I'm sure the Trump campaign wrote off as fake news, but then came Quinnipiac University, a nonpartisan poll that doesn't dabble into Democrat or Republican politics.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is ahead by 2.3 percent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So massive, massive, massive gains that the Trump team has still yet to combat and still yet to see any type of boost in their own battleground states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They were never going to win Florida.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They were never going to win Texas.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But the argument that was made by the GOP was that, sure, Kamala Harris could re-inspire the Democratic base, but Trump would re-inspire the Republican base even more against Harris than Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's from California.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And in every other state, Kamala Harris has made improvements not only in battleground states, but in safe states, red and blue.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Not only there too, but on the national level, there is consistency in where Kamala Harris performs.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris now has a 10 point advantage over Donald Trump in the swing state betting odds a week ago.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And since then, and since Joe Biden had departed the race and now entered back, Kamala Harris now entering in, she is at the highest point we have seen for Democrats in a very long time.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She now has in a Midwestern governor who's popular in his state, who has a track record to run on from Congress, who's a veteran, a high school social studies teacher, a football coach, has a story to tell that is very, very different when compared in juxtaposed with that of J.D. Vance, when that of Donald Trump, all private sector, big law, Yale Law School, all of these different things that J.D, vance doesn't have the ability to appeal to the average voter.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris maintains this lead in a way that we haven't seen for Joe Biden at all this entire election cycle.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Because if I take it away from Kamala Harris on my current election prediction, let's say she wins Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She, you know, Biden won it by two point eight.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right now, he's slated to be the victor in Georgia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right now, he's slated to be the victor in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And it is really hard to see, now that Kamala Harris is building out this advantage and expanding her lead.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, we see that on the five thirty eight numbers here, she's ahead by two point eight percent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"On the real politics average, she's ahead by Trump is ahead by zero point two percent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Here are the exact figures, harris 51 in Pennsylvania to Trump's 45.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The top line numbers, the horse race numbers, look pretty good for Kamala Harris, but specifically on the economy, a remarkable turn here to find her essentially tied, certainly within the margin, with Donald Trump on the issue that will likely, for most voters, decide this election.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And since in the past, you know, six, seven weeks, we've seen Harris put out different policies on tax increases for the wealthy as well as taxes for families, tax cuts for families, you know, she said in a speech this week that she wants to cap childcare costs at 7% household income.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
You're starting to see voters warm up to her on her economic vision.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, so when we consider the contrasting economic visions here and frankly where the candidates have been, Harris made that comment on childcare in Philadelphia with the NABJ, one of the swing states, one of the key states we're talking about here.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"As recently as 2019, Trump had said, oh, well, maybe we'll reverse that, realizing that the politics around this had been quite heightened.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You had Chuck Schumer come out in Congress yesterday and say, look, Trump imposed this, now he wants to repeal it, give me a break.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Democrats and Harris are still saying, look, we're going to pay for some of this new spending with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, but not doing a lot to bring down overall spending.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It quite literally if the Senate ends up 50 50 in favor of Democrats because of Kamala Harris is the tiebreaking vote, you could accurately blame Trump for losing Republicans, the Senate, by jumping in and endorsing Oz rather than McCormick or staying out of it altogether.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, of course, they say he didn't really lose.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's record is a disaster.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Trump announcement next Tuesday will be on those platforms.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now this is of no surprise because I've been following Kamala and her national political aspirations for a while.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, ever since she started this back in 2020, when she ran for president the first time, if you guys didn't know, yes, she has already run for president and it didn't go well at all.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She dropped out in 2019 December, well before primaries and everything got kicked off.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She was not popular, people didn't like her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her prior track record was alarming as a senator and attorney general in California.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Nobody liked her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She was polling, so poorly she was behind Pete, booty gig, Amy Klobuchar, all these randos on a democratic side.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She pulled behind, but now all of a sudden everybody likes her and she's bringing new energy into the party.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's going to be tied to the Biden record regardless of what she says or what she does.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So who are you going to vote for: oh, I'm not excited about voting for Kamala Harris, but it's better than the alternative.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There would have been no way, you think Harris can win Pennsylvania: i think she can.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I think the energy she's brought to the campaign, the fact that she's a woman and women's rights are, are going to be a big deal here in Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Let's pause here for a second, now, Kamala may have had a better chance at winning Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If she was able to select Pennsylvania's governor as surrender mate, Josh Shapiro, but there was a little bit of a problem because the Democrats have an issue with anti-Semitism in the party.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So if she was to nominate him to be the VP, that would probably hurt her more nationally, even if it would give her a bit of a boost in Pennsylvania, which is probably why they selected the Kami teacher, quote unquote, from Minnesota by way of Nebraska and Tim Walts.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A new worry since our last visit in May, Trump running mate, JD Vance.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If Donald Trump or JD Vance really says something so outrageously offensive, that could drive me to vote for vice president Harris, but it's, it's highly unlikely.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I watch his campaign rallies.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is now the third campaign in which these never Trump voters hold significant sway.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Because I don't want to see Trump elected after the chaos of the prior four years.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In my lifetime, the Republican party has changed with Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But now it's, it's a harder call just because I am not a fan of Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The same people will be behind the scenes running the country because Kamala is incompetent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala don't know, kamala is a general idiot, like worse than the normie mouth breather.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Somebody who should not be in this position, regardless of what color she is of what gender she is.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And then, after that, switched and voted to form President Trump in 2016, before going back to President Biden in 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Former President Trump lost that in 2020 by over 25 percentage points, but he still got over 180,000 votes there.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"According to our polling, black voters overall are supporting Harris at the same rate as they did for Biden in 2020, but the likelihood of turnout lags than that of white voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What more can you tell us about the policy she's unveiling and what inroads she needs to make: yeah, Lindsay, she's going to have some policies coming out that will really focus on black entrepreneurship and careers, things like loans for black entrepreneurs who want to start new businesses and things like new pathways to have more black teachers in schools.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They're cheering on because he's Taking it to custody.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's not a threat no more.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I don't You know people make everything about Trump supporters seem horrible and bad.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's definitely crazy You know to have people that wants to you know attack Trump and I'm gonna say this attack anybody No, you you literally I don't know what as far as like how far they going like, what are you charged with: i'm pretty sure something bad.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right All the way up the hill there check that out All these people y'all look at that But then you have people at a Kamala's all Talk about Kamala's rallies Trump don't have nobody yet, man.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You don't have you know people that You don't need you don't need the buses you don't need to pay people to come to see Trump you don't need that You know, I mean you don't need none of that You literally have people that really comes to support Trump and listen what he has to say That's what you have you literally have that All these people That's lit red hats I Love it That's you need you need you need that kind of support this just goes to show you like real support though This is real support.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I don't want to mess, nobody name up I get enough of it when y'all say stuff about you know, Kamala and I mess up her name, but Gotta Puerto Rican rapper, you know, I've never heard of him but they said that I guess that he was trending because one of the His wig flew off his head That's wild that's wild he felt it though he felt it it'd have been bad if he didn't notice a real blessing to be here I'm from Puerto Rico We've we yeah, we a big part of United States we really depend on the United States Since Trump hasn't been around Puerto Rico's.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, I haven't told y'all like the full story like but I've been in some way of you know counter that position and Feel like going back You know to that state I Feel like that, you know, even if that's not if he's not around the area I don't know how far it is, you know I never been a pencil in you but it just goes to show you how how strong that man is because if that was me I probably wouldn't win Not probably won't even know it, you know and I Security probably got better.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"First, though, Kamala Harris's team attacking Trump for going with Gold Star families to Arlington at their request.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What do you make of this: oh, it's a terrible, terrible thing that she did and a huge mistake.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If I were advising Kamala Harris on her campaign, I would have said, OK, let's just pretend this never happened.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, i'm talking about if I were trying to advise her and let's go talk about abortion more.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And then Kamala made the way that the Gold Star families were treated at Arlington across the river from where I'm sitting in Washington, D.C., right now.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And now I'm on Kamala's team.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If anything, all it does is strengthen Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And again, he's he's these 13 soldiers were killed because of Biden and Harris's competence.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Trump was Trump shows up.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yes, and the fact that Trump shows up just it's he's leading by example on on every single front and he's showing up when he knows it's going to be emotionally taxing and difficult.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But it's also the right thing to do in his first and foremost job as commander in chief.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala has just been there, clay had a statistician on last week who was saying that basically so go with Pennsylvania, so go with the race.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so Trump is performing not only better like with mail in votes than than than ever before, but he's also doing extraordinarily well with pro-life pro-gun Democrats, working class union Democrats.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I think that the Trump McCormick ticket you asked about David McCormick and Bob Casey, there are so many synergies between the Trump to me ticket in 16 and the Trump McCormick ticket.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But are they just inundating the airwaves with lies about Trump or is that is the is the Trump campaign, the RNC, are they fighting fire with fire: i'm just wondering about, you know, how the how the media battle is going.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I am going to be and you may well be there to Sean, because I know you spoke and did so fabulously well at one of the most recent Trump rallies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What do you think: well, look, Jessica, in Pennsylvania, the last two presidential races have come down to 44,000 votes in 80,000 votes, representing about a point or less.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A record record amount of votes, what is the Harris coalition look like, how does she ensure that she wins Pennsylvania: well, just two things.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"One is I was running against an extreme candidate who was Donald Trump's offspring, and I would note that Donald Trump and his offspring have lost every race since 2016 in Pennsylvania, every statewide race and by the way, even some races for school board and local races.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In our Commonwealth, Kamala Harris just seems to keep doing exactly what she's doing, which is showing up in communities that are oftentimes ignored and left behind forgotten areas that you know, in the past had maybe been flyover areas for national candidates.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's showing up, she's answering questions.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's looking folks in the eye and kind of letting people kick the tires.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think she's doing what she needs to do.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I joked with her the other day when I saw her Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think she had been in our Commonwealth.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Something like four and a half out of the seven days that week she's returning.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kind of in the middle of the state, more or less, do you think that this is actually effective, do you think that she can move the needle enough to make that marginal difference to win: i do and she is, and again, I'd rather be us than them.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Again, a point or less, and so I think what folks need to do is not worry about what those polls show, but just keep working and what I'm seeing on the ground is real enthusiasm for Kamala Harris folks, not only pledging to vote for her, or maybe even some of voted for her by mail already, but they're showing up at the local office and taking a shift and going out and knocking on doors in rural areas where maybe Democrats haven't performed as well in the past.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Every time since 2016, Donald Trump, or one of his political offspring, have been on the ballot.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then Donald Trump has a proven track record of ripping away people's rights and freedoms and a blueprint in this project 2025 for how to limit people's freedoms even more going forward.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He bragged about how he ripped away the freedom for women to just simply be able to make decisions over their own bodies to start a family on their own timeline and their own terms to have a full range of medical care across this country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Far more numbers out there to support Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I understand Kamala Harris is outraised Donald Trump.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She has plenty of resources to be able to communicate her message.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I do want to say because I know she's listening backstage, thank you Madam Vice President for your leadership both domestic and abroad and for your persistent and enduring advocacy for underserved communities all across the country.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So that's why it's down by more, but this is still pretty crazy when you look at the difference and you would say that would at least help Trump by you would have to say 20, maybe 30,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump has made up so much ground with where we were in 2020 versus 2024.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, in-person is always going to favor Trump, so anytime you can see a decrease of around 15%, it is good.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump has two very straightforward paths to victory that do not require sweeping swing States, North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's, it's, I mean, he won North Carolina in 2020 and 2016.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So now with his numbers, you would think it would be even easier in 2024.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He would have to flip Georgia and Pennsylvania, both of those States.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He won in 2016, he lost in 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And it's not just like, oh, he's down by one.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's down by two weeks down by one.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So even if Trump is down by three or four in a state like Michigan, he could very easily wouldn't buy two or three.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Alexa, why should I vote for Donald Trump: i cannot provide content that promotes a specific political party or a specific candidate.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Alexa, why should I vote for Kamala Harris: while there are many reasons to vote for Kamala Harris, the most significant may be that she has a strong candidate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's a strong candidate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, she's got a great track record.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She, she, I mean, she did win zero votes.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That is, I mean, she, she, she, well, she didn't make it to Iowa and then she won zero votes in 2024.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They installed her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"No, no, no, she does have a good track record.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She does, she was one of the, I think she's like the most unlike VP and history in terms of approval writing.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"No, no, no, you're right, she has a good track record.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Vice president Harris has already broken down a major gender barrier and her career.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump left office with net loss of 3 million jobs, with a 6.3% unemployment rate, with an economic contraction of 3.4%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All of it, donald Trump left office.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And they said Donald Trump was killing people when he opened up everything and allowed people to go back to work and allow it small businesses to operate again.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And it's all total gaslighting because originally Trump opened up everything too soon.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He allowed people to go back to work too soon.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he was this big horrible person who killed, I mean, they said he killed millions.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's how evil they are, and of course that in and of itself is a misrepresentation, because a lot of those people, number one, you had hospitals that were incentivized to label every death as a COVID death due to insurance.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is just a perfect example, i think he said something about the economy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump left office at the heart of COVID.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So all those numbers fall on him to where the jobs don't get added back while he's in office and they can manipulate numbers like this.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Well today former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are back on the campaign trail Trump will hold a press conference in Los Angeles County this afternoon before heading to Las Vegas for a rally this evening Harris is back in Pennsylvania today stopping first in Johnstown before holding a rally later this evening in Wilkes-Barre We have team coverage this morning with CBS News campaign reporters Zach Hudak and Olivia Rinaldi I want to start with Zach who is covering the Harris campaign for us from Washington So Zach Harris's event in Pennsylvania tonight.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They will be in a few weeks That's important to note But Trump is making the claim that look the voters already know the issues They already know the candidates Why bother but yesterday vice president Kamala Harris in Greensboro said we actually owe it to the voters to do a second debate for them to see Kind of how Trump and I are interacting on the stage what policy differences we have and how they would impact those voters So remains to be seen whether we will see these two candidates on the debate stage again as as of this moment Donald Trump is ruling it out But CBS News proposed a debate yesterday with our partners at Univision and Wall Street Journal So we welcome them anytime to come on and talk about it.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
How do you pronounce F-A-N-I Fani: donald Trump was speaking at an NRA event on Friday night.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He had that bronzer on thick and before our eyes, we someone who's truly in cognitive decline right there.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump gets lost telling a story about marble columns.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here, Donald Trump brags about how he did nothing on guns at all.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when he was presented even with bipartisan legislation to try to stop the proliferation of guns, he did nothing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he wants to brag about that, play this clip.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's the avalanche begins, and here, Donald Trump brags in no uncertain terms about killing the bipartisan border deal.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's what Donald Trump wants to spread that unhinged conspiracy that the whole name Pennsylvania will be changed.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here, Donald Trump believes he's speaking on Saturday afternoon.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Next, Donald Trump talks about the federal criminal cases where he's a criminal defendant.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But he says even though he hid classified documents that he stole, asserted every invalid, improper privilege that exists.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He said that he cooperated more than President Biden's cooperation where President Biden gave full cooperation and for doing that, President Biden was then met with a Republican special counsel who violated every single Department of Justice rule and then tried to defame him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But here Donald Trump is saying he cooperated more.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Next up, Donald Trump tells the same exact story he told over a year ago where he claims that he watched somebody shoplift and carry a refrigerator.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's got this massive.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I said, he's a pretty strong guy, right: can you believe and the end one year ago, Trump told that same story, but he's acting now like it happened again.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Here's what he said a year ago.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here, Donald Trump talks about dino dollars, whatever that means.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Play the clip, because he understood tariffs, I charged him massive hundreds of millions of din- dollars China paid to the United States.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump tells some story about rich people and subsidies, but he's slurring his entire way through this speech.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here, Donald Trump brags about, again, another unhinged lie.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He claims that he built the entire military.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He built it all.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, that's malignant narcissism right there, and of course, this follows the day before where Donald Trump said that January 6th was an insurrection caused by Nancy Pelosi.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump said he says Nancy Pelosi caused the insurrection.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then Trump undercut his lawyer because his lawyer that would also be incriminating him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Trump says it's a Nancy Pelosi insurrection here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"No, and I know that the media wants to gaslight us and the media wants to have all of these narratives and and also hoist up fascism and try to normalize Donald Trump's behavior.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The other guy's a joke, trump is a joke.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
If we look at those clips that I just showed you and say that person should be nowhere near the nuclear codes should be nowhere near a position of power that Donald Trump is someone who should be absolutely disqualified for being anywhere near any position of power because of his own behavior.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because of his statements and his conduct, if we believe that this is a place where we can all kind of come together.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Trump campaign opening a campaign office that's right behind me, the Harris campaign has about 24 campaign offices throughout the Commonwealth.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Harris rose to the top of the ticket.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Both voters remain firmly undecided, but newly energized, she has direction and I think it evens a playing field for the two candidates.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Is she going to advance the country, is it possible that she takes it maybe in reverse: we don't know 18 year old Jamel Garcia, a student at the Brothers Barber shop, says he'll vote for the first time.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Limited recent polling shows Harris performing better than Biden versus Trump among Latino voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Reading restaurant owner Cesar Lopez also recalls Harris's trip but hasn't been swayed yet.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That makes no sense I want to ask I see you're a person of color obviously in the media Trump's constantly called racist Have you heard that stuff, and what do you make of these arguments of Trump's racist: i've never heard him say one racist thing in my life.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yes, sir, you too, thank you guys Is there a particular policy or something that Trump talks to that excites you the most: i like all of his policy I like no tax on tips.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I Like his policy with the border and that's my favorite I think we should need to deport all of the illegal immigrants and I think that we need to take our country back Absolutely.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She has no policies and she's full of word salad If Kamala Harris were elected president, she'd be the first female president You're obviously a woman would send mean anything to you the final so-called glass ceiling.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The Democrats big pitch has been nowadays about women's rights so-called women's rights and abortion access What do you make of that pitch to woman, is that an important issue, yeah, I believe that Trump has turned it over to the states for the states to regulate it And I believe that was the best decision to make Were you happy to see Roe v. Wade be overturned on the heels of Trump's Supreme Court appointees: i was happy that it was handed over to the seats.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Absolutely, trump did pick JD Vance for his VP pick What do you think of JD: i love JD.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Absolutely, they're supporting you said you like his values.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He represents your values Is there anything that he speaks to in particular that really excites you as a voter: yeah, all the policies align with What we believe and he can be able to deliver it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Absolutely, have you guys supported him in the past or you guys our first time first time supporting him What brought you guys around this time: this is the third time he's running No, we just got our citizenship here in America.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Absolutely, i want to ask you a little bit about Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's the current VP What do you think about how her and Joe Biden are running the country, oh I think They They're not like really deliver what they we expect for them to deliver That's why we got a lot of stuff going on in the country So that's the one that's one of the reason why we are supporting campus last thing I wanted to ask you is what would be your biggest fear under Kamala Harris administration if she were to be elected: our biggest fear is I don't know where though.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think she's a weak leader so with Trump being President already and He can be a good leader for us and not only for the US but throughout the whole world.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I'm undecided So I like to hear both sides of each issues and I I'm open to hearing what President Trump has to say Is there something in particular he could do or say tonight to win you over as a voter: um, I wanted to hear more about how he felt about the central banking system And I know he's probably like the only president that I heard talk about that in the Federal Reserve So I was really interested in hearing what he had to say about that and I also would like to hear more about how he feels about You know black and justices in America I Really hear so many issues of people saying that Trump is racist But I would like for him to talk on that subject in particular Many in the media do call him racist for years now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Is that important to you the sort of last class ceiling, you know Um, just to break that stigma is huge just to even have a woman president Period, you know women haven't been treated equally in this country for a long time and I feel like Kamala Harris, you know She may not be the woman for the job But I do feel like it's time in America that we start listening to black women and what they have to say politically So we're out here today in Pennsylvania ahead of this Trump rally, can you tell me a little bit more about what's that, what made you decide to come out: it was local I've been wanting to see Trump I voted for Trump the first time around and second time around And I want to see him in office this time around what in particular about Trump made you want to vote for him three times now Well, he his values align with my values if you can see my hat.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I wanted to get what's your reaction to many Democrats, accusing Trump of being a threat to democracy I think they're more of a threat to democracy the way I see it there their values seem to align with socialism Between that and January 6th many Democrats are saying this sort of disqualifies him that and all the cases against him What do you make of these Democrats effort to kind of disqualify Trump, it's all a show it's all a show if you dig down deep enough follow things closely enough you'll see it's just a show and they really don't want to see him in office because they're completely afraid of him and they're they're Their abuse of and corruption of the system Let me ask Joe Biden was the original Democrat pick until they had a bad debate and swapped him out for Kamala Harris What did you make of that whole predicament, i, think Democrats should be upset that the man that they voted for on the primaries Got pushed to the side and they put in someone else who had no no votes and no primary contender Well, are you happy to see them swap out Joe Biden for Kamala Harris, do you care: well, I care to the fact that it just doesn't seem fair.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's not right, it's un-american to do it like that One of the main major pitches from the Democrats about Kamala Harris is that she's a woman She'd break the last so-called glass ceiling.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
What would you fear most about a Kamala Harris administration: her ineptitude and her Incompetence and her Her war on the Second Amendment.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's why I love Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Absolutely I want to ask Democrats this election around have been focusing on how Donald Trump is it allegedly a threat to democracy, have you heard this stuff and what do you make of that attack by Democrats: i think he was already the president for four years.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So if he was a threat to democracy, it would have happened already What do you make of Democrats who say you know: between that and January 6th this stuff disqualifies him from being president I just think that's bs personally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I don't think he had anything to do with it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Absolutely Kamala Harris if elected she would be the first female vice president this so-called last glass ceiling Does that matter to you at all that she's a woman: no, I have two sisters and a mom.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I love women Just not her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's not the one Absolutely Democrats other picture around has really been about so-called women's rights when it comes to abortion What do you think of that being the main pitch by Democrats this election cycle: i don't know.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So the fact that somebody said even recently like I guess Kamala changed her opinion about fracking, like if you said that years ago that you're gonna shut down fracking and you're not gonna allow fracking, well I believe as Americans we should honor each other's work.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Moments after shots have rung out at a rally where President Trump was addressing the crowd.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Several shots were heard, president Trump hit the stage.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Manufacturers have said that too and Donald Trump is saying, whoa, not so fast.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I believe if I'm not mistaken Donald Trump was the first person he ever voted for in his entire life only person for president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Brand new polling data suggests that Donald Trump's on pace for victory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What is up, people of the internet: it is me, Real American, back again with a new video, and today, we have to talk about the 2024 presidential election, because brand new data suggests that Donald Trump's on pace for victory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, I am not saying it's a foregone conclusion Trump's gonna win Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because if Trump wins Pennsylvania, well, at that point, he just needs Georgia, and he's at 270.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"While Harris, if she gets Pennsylvania, that hurts Trump quite a bit because now he has to win a state like Arizona and Wisconsin, just to barely crack 272.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"At that point, for Harris, she just has to win Wisconsin and Michigan, which if she is in fact winning Pennsylvania, there's a good chance of that happening because the three states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, they vote together.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So if Harris is winning Pennsylvania, there's a good chance of the bare minimum she's up in Michigan, where at that point, yeah, she just needs one more state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's all she needs at that point.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If Trump wins it, how does he lose, do you really think George is gonna vote Democrat if Harris is losing Pennsylvania: i doubt it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I know these are different states, but at that point, Trump's got it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And even if he loses Georgia somehow, well, he wins Wisconsin more than likely.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And at that point, if he just wins even Nevada, he's got the presidency.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's why the data suggesting Trump's gonna probably win Pennsylvania is not good news for Harris.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And not just that, but with the leaners, he's at 51%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So he's up by two points, according to Emerson.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Clinton plus nine, and we all know Trump won Pennsylvania by under a point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The fact that Trump's tied according to RCP, and that's what two horrendous polls, I mean, Quinnipiac, we all know their garbage.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If the same polling misoccurs that occurred back in 2020, Trump's got it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He is currently winning Pennsylvania by a couple points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's not good for her because if Quinnipiac has even half the error they had back in 2020, that means Trump's winning by a point.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She should be up by four to five points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Not just because of one pollster having Harris plus four because if you're up by only one, hell, you're not even up by a point, you're still tied.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's up by five points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now they have Trump up by two, so is it now a fake poll or maybe just maybe the theory that there's been a response bias in polling is true.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm not denying the idea that Kamala Harris is doing better than Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But if you're the Harris campaign, knowing that Biden was supposed to win Pennsylvania by six points at the same time back in 2020, you want to be up by four to five points at the bare minimum, not tied.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But yet again, it was because of pollsters like Sussacuan, Trafalgar, insider advantage, having Trump slightly ahead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's why Trump being just even tied in the average is a big deal.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They found Harris only up by a point.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And a quick reminder that we were told for weeks now, no, for about a month now that Kamala Harris's best polling was going to happen in August.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So if her best polls are Harris plus one from Signal, which I know is Republican pollster, but they tend to be accurate more often than not.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Some of the national polls suggest Trump's up again.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Does that mean that he's for sure going to win: no, but it does seem like, yeah, the response bias that was in fact impacting the polls, which I was saying for weeks now, that was the case.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If there's still response bias, even then, if Trump's winning in the RCP average come September, which is entirely possible, Harris is cooked.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because if she is not winning by five points come September 1st, let alone just not even losing, if she's down by a point, she's cooked.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Hell, you could argue she's up by a point.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's probably done because that's supposed to be her best polling.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And she is doing piss poor even compared to Biden compared to Clinton.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's tied and that's with two garbage pollsters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Democrats gained only 5,000, a quick reminder, this was happening right when the Harris quote unquote surge was happening.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's not what Harris needed, they were banking on having a three month long surge till the election.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If this pace keeps up for Trump, he's going to win Pennsylvania quite easily.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like I'm not saying by 10 points, but compared to like 2020 and 2016, he might win it by two to three points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look, I think it's more of the same from Donald Trump, someone who doesn't show the kind of respect to the military that our men and women in uniform deserve.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is what I think many people have come to expect of Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The visits that Harris made to regions such as Beaver County, which are often given less attention by national campaigns, were particularly acknowledged by him.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris has established many field offices throughout the state.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In addition to the failure of the Trump administration to deliver a comprehensive health care plan, promote sustained job creation, and rebuild the nation's infrastructure, Shapiro was critical of Trump's record for a number of other reasons as well.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But what I've seen over the last four or five weeks with Kamala Harris is just extraordinary energy.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And you see it show up at these neighborhood offices that Kamala Harris has put in place where they're showing up not just to take a shift, but also showing up and saying, hey, listen, I'm not a registered Democrat, but I still want to be part of this campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In order to pursue a more divisive and Trump-centric agenda, he made the claim that Republicans were putting the problems that are most important to families on the backburner.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Don't believe a word Donald Trump says about abortion or IVF.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Remember, it was he who packed the Supreme Court so that they would overturn Roe v. Wade, and it was he who ran to the microphones to claim credit for it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's what he's doing here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Speaking of Donald Trump, take a look at this moment from yesterday at a grocery store in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The surprise of a lifetime for a mother there as Donald Trump gives a hundred dollar bill at the checkout line to a mother of three there in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You're at the checkout line and you see the president there, Donald Trump, coming to you with a hundred dollar bill.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So that was a huge surprise, and, yeah, it was just it was awesome to meet a former president and especially Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris leads Trump across nationwide polls.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It was a packed weekend for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The former U.S. president was busy on his campaign trail.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump revisited the town where he survived his first assassination attempt, which was on the 13th of July.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Standing behind a bulletproof glass, Trump received a roaring welcome.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Joining Trump on stage was billionaire Elon Musk.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He must win to preserve democracy in America.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is a must-win situation, must win, donald Trump's campaign also shared aerial footage from Butler showing thousands of attendees.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Squashing claims made by rival Kamala Harris that Donald Trump's rallies don't have big numbers.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"After addressing the crowds in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump rallied in the battleground state of Wisconsin, where the Republicans said that the state needed liberation from the Democrats.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz have begun a week-long media blitz where they will be interacting with media organizations and social media influencers across the country.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Nationally, Kamala Harris has a slight lead over Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The Democrat is averaging at about 49.7%, while her Republican rival is at about 46.3%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"However, the real contest is in the battleground states where Harris and Trump are in a tight contest.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Out of the seven swing states, Harris leads in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Trump has a lead in North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Both Harris and Trump are trying to sway as many undecided voters as they can.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I am playing it as if Trump might win and I should be more optimistic.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And right now, it looks like Trump will do better in November than he did four years ago.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania yesterday or the day before yesterday, rather, was legitimately massive.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so for anybody who's like, oh, no, no, no, Kamala Harris is going to win these swing states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump's winning Arizona, according to the Real Clear Politics average.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's not comfort when I I don't feel comfort when I see Harris winning by a fraction of a point in Wisconsin and Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump is winning Georgia per Real Clear Politics and FiveThirtyEight.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's a state that Trump lost in 2020.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's winning Georgia right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You should just be more optimistic, i'm realistic, if the election were held today, the most likely outcome is Harris wins, but by a smaller margin electorally than Biden won in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So don't come to me with that, i need to pretend like Harris has got this sort of stuff.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Welcome back everyone, with just 35 days left until the 2024 US presidential election, the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is heating up, especially in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In this one, Kamala Harris leads with 48% of the vote, while Donald Trump trails with 46%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A narrow one point lead for Trump here, however, in another Beacon research poll from the same dates, Harris takes back the lead, securing 48% while Trump sits at 46%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"ACFR vote conducted a poll between September 1st and 25th, showing Harris leading with 52% to Trump's 48%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is ahead by four points here.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"From September 19th to 25th, morning consult has Harris at 50% and Trump at 44%, with Harris leading by a six point margin.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Another morning consult poll conducted on the same dates shows Harris at 49% and Trump at 46%, a solid three point lead for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In a third morning consult poll from those dates, Harris takes a strong 51% to Trump's 45%, putting her ahead by six points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And finally, a fourth morning consult poll shows Harris leading 51% to Trump's 46%, giving her a five point lead.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Will Harris hold on to her lead, or will Trump make a last minute surge: only time will tell, and we'll be here to keep you updated every step of the way.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's really sticking it to them.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's okay as long as our side wins and and and by the way I'm sorry gentlemen I've noticed this especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior the bullying and the putting people down is a sign of strength and I am I am here to tell you that is not what real strength is.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris is focusing her energy on speaking to Pennsylvania voters tonight, while Trump spoke to reporters at his golf club on the California coast.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There, the former president escalated his attacks on Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And Trump continued to target the Haitian immigrant community in Springfield, Ohio.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Still, Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, doubled down Friday, with Vance suggesting that the Haitian immigrants were bringing diseases to Springfield.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This has to stop, though much of Trump's speech in Tucson, Arizona last night repeated baseless claims about migrants, he also made a new promise to working class voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"At a campaign rally in Michigan on Thursday, Governor Tim Walz dismissed Trump's baseless claims about the Haitian immigrants.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And in North Carolina last night, Vice President Harris took aim at Trump's debate performance, highlighting his promise to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And as he said in the debate, he made clear he has no plan to replace it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You remember: he has, quote, concepts of a plan.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris left DC today for Pennsylvania, making a stop at a small business in Johnstown before heading to a rally in Wilkes-Barre tonight.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They've launched three new ads since the debate, all highlighting exchanges in that debate, including ones on abortion, as well as Harris saying that she wants to represent all Americans.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They're also doing more targeted interviews, Jeff.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris did one today with a local Pennsylvania anchor.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's going to be joining a live stream next week with Oprah Winfrey that is going to be with a lot of local grassroots groups, including ones that are targeting black voters, Latino voters, rural voters, you name it, across the board.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And so her campaign is trying to make her available much more in the battleground states.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's also expected to potentially sit down with the National Association of Black Journalists as early as next week.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Because right now, even though she is still trying to reach undecided voters, that small sliver, Jeff, she very much is trying to close that enthusiasm gap that President Biden had with the key elements of her base.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I want to ask you about this far-right activist, this woman, Laura Loomer, who's been traveling with Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Who is she, and why does she have Donald Trump's ear: so Laura Loomer is well-known to us at the NewsHour, as well as to politicians and reporters across the board.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And he did not disavow her, did not condemn her comments.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"A free spirit, oK, so Lisa, how are Republicans responding to all of this: even Trump Republicans, as Laura mentioned, are responding quickly.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They think they see the danger here politically for this association.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that includes some Trump Republicans who themselves have had extreme speech.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This does not represent President Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But it's not just that side of the Trump spectrum.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Also, Tom Tillis, somewhat more moderate Trump supporter from North Carolina, wrote, Laura Loomer is a crazy conspiracy theorist who regularly utters disgusting garbage.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But the fact remains that Trump has not disassociated himself from her as much as some of his supporters will.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I want to talk about voters who support Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We've been to so many Trump events.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And while most Trump supporters, I would say, I talk to, talk about his characteristics, a significant group at every single rally I attend raised conspiracy theories with me, the woman who thought Joe Biden was dead, another woman in New Hampshire who told me she was sure that Mother Teresa was a man, and by the way, the father of Anthony Fauci.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, Trump is pointing to FBI statistics and saying they're not the best one.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Let me look at the two different kinds of statistics he's talking about.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, he says people should pay attention to something called the National Crime Victimization Survey.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when Trump says that the other survey data shows more crime, he's not saying that it's relative to 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That same data he's talking about also shows a decrease in the last year.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So there's more to it than what he says.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump returns to Harrisburg.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The brevity of it all, i didn't think he would run away.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But no, he came back, he's back in the heartland, Trump is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And look at all this Trump support.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump support for as far as the eye can see.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Oh, it's a runaway Trump train.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's a runaway Trump train.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump was, to show his love, try to win over the people of Pennsylvania to his side to become Republicans or whatever.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba, yeah, so lots of Trump love, i don't know about numbers, but I would probably I'd probably say is a few thousand people here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Trump is expected to speak tonight at 6 p.m. 6 p.m. He addresses the great the great center of the country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump t shirt, fight, motherfucker, fight, i'm in the scene.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So everybody's with Trump, they're all for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So I absolutely love Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I absolutely love him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Are you about the facts of the Trump, were you this or that: and I was like, Listen, I just believe in my heart that Trump loves us and wants to fix America.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm a she her woman everything.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I remember hearing that Kamala Harris went online and was like, you know how the Olympics were like the opening of the Olympics.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, so you think you think that Trump can win with all the cheating that goes on: i an assassination that's them two weeks ago, before the Republican Convention.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if he doesn't win, we all know what happened.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So Kamala is trying to take his place.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Somebody else is running her shit.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Historically, mail-in ballots have been a significant source of democratic votes, and any reduction in the number of valid ballots could favor Trump's campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm just giving a deep dime and noticing some broadly, I would say Concerning very concerning for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So let's get right into it First of all Trump leads by point five.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But the thing is I Think as we all know here it You know the polling aggregate does slightly favor Trump in Trump has unique point of strength here Cuz let's go to something like the 2000 election and you can see Gore was up for right 2004 Kerry was up two and a half 2008 Obama won by over 10 2012 by 5 so Trump's connection to the state with his economic policies Really is what drove him to victory a very narrow one against Hillary Clinton and even a loss that was still the most narrow in This century against Biden back in 2020.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So Trump definitely has a unique point of strength there I want to talk about why Pennsylvania is the most important state in the election Which is why we're going to be talking about it so much It's because if you give everybody all their states that they won not in 2020 But like and these doesn't mean safe states just because they're in the deepest color But it's just states that are not considered to be the seven big competitive swing states So if you give each candidate their safer states, let's just say well Kamala Harris, let's just give Trump, North Carolina, right: let's give him Georgia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He only needs Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She doesn't need any Sunbelt states so very key there and You can see Pennsylvania is key because we're saying what Trump's slightly more likely to win It's these two Kamala.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's harder, it's it's it's not what they need messaging obviously, it's not terrible, but the emphasis on it is probably too much and As you can see she just does not have the connection it's just it's something Oz it was plagued with in 2022 David Cormack does not seem to have the connection in my opinion and Yeah, so he says here we don't have the Catholic connection with Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So See so there's so as this advertising executive Says there's not really a reason to believe she can approach the numbers by and was able to get last time it doesn't mean she can't win the state but It's it's concerning and It's a big demographic also I just don't think she appeals to the white non-college educated or what would in class vote is nearly as well as binding good as Shown in the teamsters polling, but you can see this here It's not very good for Harris and obviously the Irish sense of history, you know that that's a thing but um She just doesn't connect to it and it's a problem and I know something striking I want I'll display here because obviously You know Bob Casey Jr. Is running for reelection and he is running for reelection Leading by just under four points and with the exception of you mess little and Quinnipiac Every other poll has been two or four points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So maybe as an internal poll with the race is a little bit closer than these polls show but and maybe you know Trump's beating combo that's a bigger takeaway because This was surprising to me.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, so that would be a two-point trend to the right and there's that but then of course As you can see she doesn't have much of a connection with Northeastern, Pennsylvania So as you can see through all these counties, I'm gonna multi select them and just trim them Let's let's say not anything nuts But something definitely impactful like five points to the right for Donald Trump just just based off You know these counties in Northeastern Pennsylvania and also just Eastern Pennsylvania because Biden had an advantage all there So let's let's go five points to the right.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well now She's only at point 16 Let's give Philadelphia that cuz Trump has been doing better in Philadelphia from last time and likely will continue that trend Well, he's up point 38 and even if you look at the fact that he could gain in some of the working-class You know Northwestern and Southwestern Counties of Pennsylvania because she probably has a less connection there than any vote and probably not as much as the east I'm gonna give him like a three-point shift as you can see here If that's the case he wins by point seven D to exactly the margin won by in 2016.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And if she doesn't win, Pennsylvania Kamala is very likely done So anyways, everybody, thank you so much for watching this video Please make sure to suggest videos in the comment section down below for me to make Please like please subscribe and as always thank you so much for watching epi out",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The economy was higher inflation was lower things were better overall and now with Kamala's Administration things haven't been so fantastic and she's saying she can fix the problems that her administration has caused But I just don't know if I can afford to take that risk Were you leaning towards the former president coming in tonight, probably and did you have forum in 2016 or 2020: i did So decision made there.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
What did you think: as to who I would vote for in this election I Strongly felt Kamala was more optimistic more respectful I thought she had plans that she Tried to describe in the minutes worth of time that she had I mean they really were limited with their time so I Don't know I just felt more strongly for her as opposed to her opponent I want to talk about some of the moments the debate because As we told you guys before the debate each of these individuals had a dial and if they turn the dial to the right Then they felt positive about what they were hearing in that moment if they turned it to the left They felt less so they felt negative about what they were hearing we could track that throughout the debate We're gonna show you a couple of moments where you saw the biggest movement Towards positive direction for both of those candidates You will see the lines at the bottom of the screen and you will see that movement as the sound we play you plays out We're gonna start with this Because they're radical the Democrats are radical in that and her vice presidential pick Which I think was a horrible pick by the way for our country because he is really out of it But her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Third, mathematically, it would be very difficult for either Trump or Harris to reach the necessary 270 electoral votes without winning Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris as a woman of color and the first female vice president has an advantage in attracting voters in these areas.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris' team is running online ads targeting voters in Hispanic-heavy areas of eastern Pennsylvania and ads featuring Republican members who have voted for her on over 130 rural radio stations.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"According to a member of Trump's campaign, the former president has sent his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, Ohio, to more stops in Pennsylvania than anywhere else, this state is also where Trump held an exclusive meeting with Sean Hannity on Fox News.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"On October 2nd, Trump returned to Pennsylvania to hold two rallies in Scranton and Reading.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"While former First Lady Melania Trump has yet to appear at any campaign rallies, Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, recently had a beer while watching a football game in suburban Philadelphia and spoke at a voter registration concert in Pittsburgh.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The vice president just laughed, but in fact, in September, Harris visited Pennsylvania once every three days, a remarkable frequency for a battleground state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party's strategy, kamala Harris, as the leading Democratic candidate, is employing a strategy of maintaining strong support in urban areas while trying to expand her influence in suburban regions.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her campaigns in Pennsylvania focus on policies that aim to improve the lives of residents, particularly in the post-COVID-19 context.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"However, Harris faces challenges in rural and traditional industrial areas, where her green energy policies may raise concerns about job losses.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"To counter this, her strategy emphasizes that green policies will create new jobs in various sectors, from clean energy to high-tech manufacturing.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Therefore, when Democratic candidate Kamala Harris promotes her economic agenda, she heads to Pittsburgh, the industrial heart of Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"When announcing her running mate, she went to Philadelphia.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And when choosing the venue for her first rally featuring former President Barack Obama on October 10th, she once again returned to Pittsburgh.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump and the Republican Party's strategy, donald Trump, who won Pennsylvania in 2016, still enjoys strong support from rural and working-class voters in the state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump focuses on protecting jobs in traditional industries such as coal and steel, while criticizing Democratic clean energy policies as threats to the local economy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump has allocated the majority of his advertising budget to Pennsylvania and has held more rallies in this battleground state than any other since Harris officially entered the race for the White House.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump continues to emphasize issues related to immigration, border security, and opposing the expansion of social programs, which he argues contribute to the rising national debt.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"By focusing on these issues, Trump hopes to strengthen support from rural voters and attract more middle-class suburban voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump has an advantage in using a tough stance on China to shore up support from working-class voters in manufacturing sectors, while Harris must try to strike a more cautious approach to balance economic and diplomatic interests.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So the Harris campaign working very quickly on this one and this is just the latest moment in what has been an anything but ordinary election season.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Who will be her running mate: harris's decision is expected soon and CBS News reports she met with three finalists in Washington D. C. On sunday Arizona Senator Mark Kelly Minnesota Governor Tim Walls and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is also having formal interviews with candidates who have not been confirmed in the media both in person and virtually according to a source.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The three things she's looking for competence character and core values and she has to have a personal connection and relationship with that person.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris has struggled to attract independence, of course, swing voters and non college educated voters, which have been a harder sell for her to make.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Alright man, so we got some pretty big news for Kamala Harris here.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump would accede to mr.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump that is why he wanted to decrease the importance of NATO He was playing right into Putin's hand so she was going pretty hard also in the debate on like being pro NATO It's kind of like not like a super a position that people are gonna really take a large side on either way I think and sort of be like oh man well that person's pro NATO That's my voter for them like no one's ever gonna say that kind of thing But I think it's an interesting strategy of like hey, you know Donald Trump is somebody who's going to be more sort of Okay with Vladimir Putin being able to expand it So that's gonna end up allowing Poland to you know be more likely to be taken over and so Polish Americans Hey, look out look out, you know, you do want Poland to be taken over.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump has suggested that a deal could be brokered to avert more suffering if Ukraine goes to Putin It is the beginning of a domino effect.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Mr. Trump partly because the Republicans plan to clean up the immigration system the United States immigration immigration immigration he said so I Think there seems to be something like I don't know if it's true But I have definitely heard that like generally the Polish sort of diaspora is more like sort of Disconnected from being Polish than others Even if they do identify with being Polish or are sort of with Poland They still will put that aside and kind of look at what's going on in America instead.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump slammed CBS News for the October 7th sit-down interview with Vice President Kamala Harris.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He accused the network of quote, deceitful editing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The actual answer, the longer answer that is unedited, you saw her kind of fumbling through the response, making a claim that I don't think is true, that there were movements by Israel based on feedback we have given them.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What specifically is she pointing to, didn't we have a Rafa red line at one point: they went into Rafa anyway.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So I think that was not true, but it was a much more confused, so my point being, in the unedited portion, she makes a claim about how the administration has handled Israel that I do not think is true.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In the edited version, she responds swiftly and is not seen to make that claim.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's why it would benefit for Kamala Harris to be more precise about whether or how her policy differs from Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And then there's the criticism of her answer.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So aside from her answer, which I do believe she needs to be much more clear on, at this stage, she should be very specific.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She should understand or have some sort of more elaborate explanation.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I know she's trying to keep the Zionists in the party happy and she's trying to keep the most progressive members of the Democratic Party happy, including the Arab American community in the Rust Belt states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But she does need to have a better answer.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That happens on every network, and Donald Trump is using that as ammunition.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's smart on his part because he's always blaming the media.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But you know what: he does all the stuff.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I, as a progressive, am criticizing his approach in this interview because pretty much every question was out of the Republican handbook in which he had to defend, in some cases completely bonkers claims, where he could be a thoughtful journalist, which I think he is at times.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I don't know 70,000 votes 80,000 votes perhaps and in 2016 Trump won it very narrowly And so it used to be predominantly Republican then it was voting Democratic for about 20 years and then Now it's the last two elections.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He was saying that he wasn't necessarily going to accept the results of the campaign I mean, he's never been shy about saying exactly What he intends to do and what he how he intends to respond So in one of the debates that fall with Hillary Clinton there was the question was asked You know, are you going to abide by the results of the election if you lose and he said well not necessarily stay tuned We'll have we'll see what happens each tonight.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'll look at it at the time and that was at that time an extraordinary thing to say I mean my jaw-drap because I was still looking at things the way things have always been traditionally done You know, of course, you're going to abide by it But so he said that and the other thing he said during those same debates was that if he won He might want to prosecute Hillary Clinton and there was some line that he in one of the debates that you know You're gonna be in jail or you should be in jail just awfully good that someone With the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country because you'd be in jail Secretary so he was signaling this whole notion of You're going to prosecute your political enemies and nobody had ever talked that way before Those were the two main things that led me to write those things is clear and present danger and you know, I I Lament the fact that they have now been born out by reality Yeah, and what do you think will happen if Trump loses in November if he loses in November, we have a very high Probability I should say of more post-election chaos Whether it's organized or spontaneous if we look to see what happened in 2020, you know What what does it say on the National Archives building, what's past his prologue, and he already did that in 2020 he lost 60 court cases, but it didn't seem to matter and everybody in the last resort was to have this This insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th but my fear is that November could be just as This would be the nice word for just as raucous as it was in 2020, right, in response to recent news coming out about Trump sending Vladimir Putin COVID tests in 2020 during the shortage You posted on X saying that these reports quote would be an electoral game-changer in a normal country What do you mean by this claim in like normal country: well a normal country where a normal country where if you have a president who is Taking steps to help a foreign adversary as opposed to helping your own citizens a normal country would find that to be Highly problematical at the very least, but if you notice This report came out two days ago.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So Georgia has 16, that would put him over the top with Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin and Michigan still on the table.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Again, shaded red, what else could Trump do: he could go out west and win Arizona.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Then if he wins Nevada, 271, 270 needed to win.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's over the top, at the same time, if Pennsylvania stays blue, that's why it's so important to Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then she has the slight advantage.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So let's look at some of the possibilities for her, this is what we talked about a lot on Friday, right: where you have the blue wall strategy and you have the sunbelt strategy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She could go to Georgia.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If Harris does again, she's not there yet.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But if she adds in, say, Arizona along with Georgia, that's a possibility.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's the only blue out there, but Trump can run up the score in places like, well, Butler County, that's where the assassination attempt took place, but that's Trump Country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
All the counties around there are Trump Country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But here's a question to ponder, can Harris's newfound momentum in the suburbs of Pennsylvania and among younger voters carry her past Trump's formidable base, especially in a state like Florida where Trump holds an undeniable edge among Hispanic voters: let's dive deep into the evolving dynamics of these critical states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Revealing that Kamala Harris currently holds a narrow 49% to 47% lead over Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris's growth in Pennsylvania underscores how critical this state has become.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris has made impressive gains among younger voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris leads Trump by a staggering 54% to 40% among voters aged 18 to 49.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The suburban surge, Harris's key to victory: perhaps the most dramatic development in Pennsylvania is Harris's surge in suburban areas.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Harris's ability to appeal to them could prove decisive.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Back in April, donald Trump held a narrow lead over Joe Biden in these areas.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Fast forward to now, and the tables have turned significantly, harris has managed to flip the suburbs in her favor.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This 11-point swing is a crucial factor in her overall lead in the state and speaks volumes about the changing dynamics of the American electorate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Why is Harris made such strides in the suburbs: part of the answer lies in her ability to connect with suburban women and younger families.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Demographics that have grown increasingly disillusioned with Trump's rhetoric and policies.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In contrast, trump's strength remains solid in rural Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump held a massive 36-point advantage over Biden in rural areas.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
While Trump still commands a majority in these areas.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The narrowing gap suggests that even some of his most loyal supporters are reconsidering their options.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump holds a 7-point lead over Kamala Harris among Hispanic voters statewide.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Overwhelmingly support Trump, with 61% backing him compared to just 28% for Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This solid support is a critical part of Trump's Florida strategy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Particularly in the Miami-Dade area, however, harris has found strong support among Puerto Rican voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Leading Trump by a comfortable margin of 58% to 33%.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Outside of the Cuban American and Puerto Rican communities, trump holds a narrower 47% to 41% lead over Harris among other Hispanic voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's message of economic strength and job creation resonates strongly with voters concerned about inflation.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"According to the poll, trump is trusted more than Harris to handle immigration by a margin of 55% to 38%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This reflects the strong support Trump has built among voters who prioritize border security and tougher immigration policies.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris's ability to consolidate support among younger voters and suburban residents in Pennsylvania has given her a narrow lead.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The question is, will Harris's surge in Pennsylvania be enough to counterbalance Trump's strength in Florida: the answer could hinge on turnout.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Conclusion, as the 2024 presidential election approaches, the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is shaping up to be one for the history books.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris's momentum in Pennsylvania's suburbs and among younger voters provides her with a path to victory.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But Trump's solid base in Florida's Hispanic community keeps him firmly in the game.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But former President Trump has his own issues in Pennsylvania, the suburbs.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Talk a little bit about what's going on there, yeah, so I mean, after 2016, Trump really starts to lose the suburban vote, especially the suburban women vote.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's more than the forty four thousand votes that Trump won in 2016.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I had one source tell me that Trump doesn't need these voters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Like he could just really drive out the support in these red counties in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But then again, in a race where every single vote counts, it might behoove him to try and win them back.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Definitely, the next Biden versus Trump rematch, yeah, thank you, Mabinti, you can read Mabinti and the rest of our political teams coverage at WashingtonExaminer.com.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"George, what are you learning: yeah, Jose, well, for context here, last month the Trump campaign opened up a Latino-Americans for Trump office here in Reading, Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, Trump campaign officials tell us that's no coincidence, but they built this office as a campaign office for all.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Both voters remain firmly undecided, but newly energized, she has direction, and I think it evens a playing field for the two candidates.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Is she going to advance the country, is it possible that she takes it maybe in reverse: we don't know yet.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's switching to Trump in 2024, frustrated by the rising cost of living and running a business in Reading.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She now volunteers at the recently opened Trump campaign office.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's just, I don't trust her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Why: because her background, I don't trust her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She'll vote Harris in November.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The fact that she came down in the middle of the city to talk to people at the community college for me was the most positive thing.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Reading restaurant owner Cesar Lopez also recalls Harris' trip, but hasn't been swayed yet.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Mark, Momma Kamala wants to ban fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Neither is Walls, who's made it his signature issue as governor.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris, as far as we know, again, they've gone silent on all of these plans with EVs.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But that's what Harris walls are all about.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Walk us through why Pennsylvania matters so much.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If Harris were to win this state and keep those upper Midwest states, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, that's most likely the ballgame.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Of course, though, Trump won here in 2016 before Biden went back in 2020 and polls show that he has a pretty good shot.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump has a pretty good shot at winning back some other states.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Think Arizona, Georgia, so Trump knows that if he wins here, he's on a really good path to maybe winning.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"During and after the debate, Donald Trump seemed to be on the defense.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, on the other side, Donald Trump, he is really leaning into his traditional base of support.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He was out there camp on the road with a right wing activist, Laurel Lumer, and sort of trying to announce new policy initiatives, like something like No Taxes on Overtime, really leaning into blue collar voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Mary Alice, we know immigration is an important issue for a lot of voters out there, but we've seen Trump doubling down on those unsubstantiated claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What's the latest in terms of his messaging and some of the fallout: yeah, we know that over the last four years, about 10 to 15,000 Haitian immigrants have moved to this town in Springfield, Ohio.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's talked about the strain on health care and housing.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But it was interesting, ABC got an interview with him and he also talked about how Trump's words are not helping.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The boy's father has also spoken out, really asking Trump to stop.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, it's hard to know the lasting effects on that town, on this country, when it comes to Trump's words, the ways that he often dehumanizes, demonizes immigrants.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We do know that when Trump was president, he worked to try to overturn temporary protective status, those sort of visas for Haitian immigrants.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is trying to juice the margins.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala's operation is being poorly run in the nation's biggest battleground.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I don't think she understands Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Here is one thing that she is going to do, legalize recreational marijuana for black Americans.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, she has a whole post dedicated to that one, which is, whoa, no one should go to jail for smoking weed, which is hilarious, because Kamala Harris prosecuted and put people in jail for smoking weed, which is just wild.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala having a tough time in Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Inside Team Harris's unusual levels of finger pointing, which is very typical for these people, where there's no leadership at all.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Uh-oh, latino and black Democratic leaders met with Harris officials behind closed doors in separate meetings in Philadelphia late last month, said five people who attended or who were briefed on it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala has a lot going on here, man.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now Harris's path to victory depends on her ability to turn out the Democratic voters of Philly.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In a statement, national campaign manager, Julie Rodriguez said that Harris's ground game and outreach are stronger than Trump's and we're aggressively crisscrossing the state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"All right, so use the proper labels, now the Harris campaign provided a list of politico of several examples of surrogate events aimed at engaging voters of color, actress America and Ferrera and others are all going to be there.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You're not allowed to say that if you're con Harris Latinos con Harris and that is just a bad phrasing, right, i think that's why it's what does Trump use, he uses Latinos poor Trump, right: it's not with Harris because it's con right in English con is not a good word.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is going to create an opportunity agenda for black men.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So when Trump said the word black jobs, remember they lambasted him for that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now she's good paying jobs for black men which I think is different.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And so Kamala will help protect them for them or something: i don't know.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And if black men weren't excited about that enough because Kamala Harris is going to be creating new opportunities.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Well she has a whole post dedicated to that one which is boom.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
No one should go to jail for smoking weed which is hilarious because Kamala Harris prosecuted and put people in jail for smoking weed which is just wild and made jokes about it.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, sent people to jail, she was a prosecutor.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So says Kamala Harris will legalize recreational marijuana breaking down unjust barriers that hold black men and other Americans back and making sure black Americans have opportunities to succeed as the marketplace takes shape.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Well she prosecuted black men for marijuana and other drug crimes.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But it seems a little inappropriate to me but that's Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The hip hop community needs to hear more from VP Harris about what is her plans and plans of action for black males.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
A lot of black males are not into the Harris campaign.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So there is a problem in the Kamala Harris campaign with black males.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The former first lady has been working behind the scenes to boost Harris and they're expected to have her appear on the campaign trail but it hasn't happened yet.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Many would like to see helping Harris is not there, she's absent from the campaign trail.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Well Trump's getting shot at so they're going to shoot at me.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is taking Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's their goal, and this really shows sort of just how far left that Kamala Harris got in that 2019 Democratic primary when she was running with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She was making this extremely bold promise that she was going to take the US oil industry possibly criminally prosecute them for their role in climate change.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She compared it to big tobacco saying they knew the effects of climate change.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's the big news of this episode, how the media is turning on Kamala Harris for the first time in the last couple of days.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I made Trump the favorite there, as do most of my Democratic sources, but she's spending an unprecedented amount of money.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She'll continue to work it there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here's Time Magazine, harris declined repeated request for an interview for this story.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In contrast, Trump talked about his policy vision with a Time reporter for 90 minutes across two interviews.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So Kamala Harris unprecedented hidden, but she gets real brave when it comes down to destroying oil and fracking in Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So yes, is the answer, yeah, that's her back in 2019, back when she was telling the truth on the subject, but here's more of CNN turning on her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"All right, obviously that is extremely different than what she is presenting right now.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's now lying, and she hasn't given a reason why she changed her position.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Only she just goes, was I, I was against fracking: now we're for it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She never says why, because she always said it was some kind of a crime.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But this isn't the only thing that she's flipped on that you found and you found a lot of other inconsistencies.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, she's flip flopped on a lot of issues related to energy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She said she was going to ban plastic straws.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She said she was going to ban fracking.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And she said she would eliminate the filibuster to pass the Green New Deal now.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, why isn't she telling you the truth about her positions and her goals: but again, CNN is done with her garbage.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She also ran Facebook ads during that campaign, which were touting her support for the Green New Deal, which were saying that she was going to take on big oil to stop for their role in contributing to climate change.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What do you ask Vice President Harris: send them to me here or on Instagram, Brett Baer and Roseanne Barr down there responds.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Ask her why she only goes on programs of people too weak to actually challenge her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Oh my, and Harris was terrible on Fox News the other night.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He got a hold of Kamala Harris' medical report on this tweet.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"As to her completely desperate request from my medical statement, she's dying to see my cholesterol, which is 180.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"According to her doctor's report, she suffers from urticaria, defined as a rash of round red welts on the skin that itch intensely, sometimes with dangerous swelling.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She also has allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis, a very messy and dangerous situation.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
These are deeply serious conditions that clearly impact her functioning.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Maybe that's why she can't answer even the simplest of questions asked by 60 Minutes and others.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Okay, Grandma, do you wanna vote for the first black woman president ever: okay, she's a Democrat too.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris, now that I've voted for who you wanted me to, can I have food and water, please: but that's not gonna help, guys.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Here's the poly market, trump is higher than ever.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now Trump is plus three in Pennsylvania and you do have the Senate very close with Casey only up by two over McCormick.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Some of these swing states really tightening some of them like Michigan and Pennsylvania flipping to where Trump is leading and Wisconsin is basically tied.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It'll probably be Harris plus two or plus three if that, and when the Rasmussen poll gets put in, you're going to see Trump probably have like a one to a 1.2 point lead in Pennsylvania as he expands his lead.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's got a lead in Michigan.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, he's starting to lead all these states and these are, these are really good polling numbers for Trump in states like Pennsylvania where the margin is going to be very slim, but if you get a plus three, a plus four, you will have the overall edge in terms of the aggregate.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's what we're seeing from that, and you can see when it comes to the presidential election winner, Trump is maintaining around a 10 point lead over Harris and he's had that lead for basically a week at this point or maybe a little bit less than a week, maybe a little bit less than a week.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And really, I thought there was going to be some correction and maybe there was some slight correction cause Trump went up by about 12 and it's come back down a little bit.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But nonetheless, you are seeing Trump, this is very healthy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's a, he's maintaining ever since he took the lead here, he's been able to maintain this big lead in terms of the betting.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, Bill Clinton is like campaigning for Trump at this point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And America is not having enough, so Bill Clinton is coming out and endorsing Trump, basically.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You had a plus three, remember, Trump basically swept all the swing states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What was it outside of Nevada in 2016: and that's with Dems being plus three, according to Gallup, 2016 Dems were plus six Trump nearly one.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If you're a Republican, there would have to be a crazy deviation that we haven't seen in over two decades for it to signal a Harris victory because if she wins the popular vote by a point, she's not winning the electoral college even with the recent shifts we're going to that we've seen in New York and possibly Illinois and California and Florida and all of those states are getting more conservative.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So Trump's going to make up more ground in terms of the popular vote.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And we do know that even if Trump wins Pennsylvania by two and a half to three, that's still a close race.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She was three and a half years as VP.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She was one of the most unlikable VPs ever.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She was consistently minus 14, minus 15 in terms of approval.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And then out of nowhere, like Pixie dust, oh my God, now she's likable.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, what did she do in the span of three months: nothing.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And her approval rating is going back down basically even with Trump, which would be a death sentence for her campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If that ended up being true, if the final numbers on approval rating in the exit polls are like even, I mean, it's, it's, she's not winning like that.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He's maintaining a big lead, which I didn't even expect.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's been no correction, trump is maintaining a 10 point lead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I think people just realized that if you factor in all the data in 2016, 2020, you get this new Raspies and pull Trump three plus three in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now you're getting multiple polls, some liberal polls coming out saying Trump's leading Michigan when the entire liberal narrative was that, Oh my God, she's going to win Michigan.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"RFK juniors endorsed Trump, so he's not going to take much from Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And so it's going to help Donald Trump in the end and pretty much everything I've seen says that Trump probably is going to sweep all the swing States right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's going to be the, this is the best Trump is polling by far.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What was it: nBC that had Harris plus six.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now they've got Harris plus two.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think they have a tide now in terms of a popular vote.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump involved in an election tied it with a in a liberal pollster with just the pure popular vote.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If we end with Harris getting 48.7 Trump getting 48.3, the election's not close.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump's winning over 300 electoral votes based on electoral math.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Would you look at that Rasmussen: it bumps Trump up.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm telling you, but Trump's not sitting plus point three.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump sitting plus point three.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Did they really deviate that much to now overcorrect and now over favor Trump, really: i mean, you know, it's just like insider advantage was really good in 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They've got Trump up by two.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This morning, the Cook Political Report moved three battleground states that are key, Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada, from lean Republican to toss-up, citing increased Democratic energy and unity around Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Congressman, thank you for being here, and let's start with this renewed energy from the Democratic campaign in the form of Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She is serving as vice president right now, but what do you want to know about her personal vision for the Oval Office, maybe even separate from President Biden's: well, look, I think the big first decision she had to make was to choose a running mate, choose a future governing partner in Governor Walz, which she did.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think it bodes well for her judgment and her willingness to now continue the good work of the Biden-Harris administration.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Does she need to differentiate herself a little bit, show maybe a specific vision that is separate from the work that she had as vice president underneath President Biden: look, she's going to be her own candidate, and she is.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What's your reaction to that, does she need to do a bit of a better job selling her vision for the economy, does she need to introduce that to voters: she's been our nominee now only for a few weeks, so of course you've got some campaigning to do.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And folks know that Vice President Harris has been part of administrations, been standing up for working people and standing up for folks' freedom.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's going to be part of, I know, Vice President Harris's message in western Pennsylvania and all over the country.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's the vice president of the United States and is helping President Biden navigate crises across the globe and here at home.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Vice President Harris, I am sure, is going to be open with the press.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I know she's been talking to folks to and from on the flights.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And look, the contrast between transparency on her part and Donald Trump is just tremendous.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's the issue of fracking, that's something that in the past Kamala Harris has been opposed to.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her campaign now says that she supports.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"How does that resonate with voters in your district: well, that's the right position for her to take.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's where the Biden Harris administration has been.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So that's the right decision for Vice President Harris to make.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And frankly, the fact that she has so strong support from the union movement, from folks in labor, tells you about her values, tells you about who she is as a candidate and why labor is going to be showing up for her in Pennsylvania come November.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And the stakes cannot be higher, i don't forget what it was when Donald Trump was in the White House.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I don't forget the insurrection he tried to lead and failed at leading.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he doesn't say, oh, no, she's not for that anymore.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And in 2016, Trump, I remember being up there in 2016 and coming home and writing and saying, he's going to win Erie.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He narrowly lost it in 2020 to Joe Biden.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, with three weeks to go until the U.S. presidential election, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have held rival campaign events in the battleground state of , in Pennsylvania, Harris announced a plan to give black men more economic opportunities and described some of her opponent's behavior as increasingly unhinged.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged by all-time favorite chart and let's listen to Pavarotti sing Ave Maria.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump spoke at a town hall event in Oaks where he promised to increase oil drilling to drive down energy costs.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, his remarks were twice interrupted by medical emergencies in the crowd.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He blamed a lack of air conditioning and called for music to be played.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think the messaging was very interesting in terms of Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She sort of stepped up, you know, she's always sort of for months, she has been arguing that former President Trump is unfit.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"However, she is stepping up and increasingly and more aggressively arguing that not only is he unfit, but that he's dangerous for the nation if he's reelected.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She did that at the rally today.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She also unveiled a new ad that features some of his former national security aides basically saying that so that she it is a notable and more aggressive take from the vice president.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Clearly, her campaign is trying to shake stuff up because, you know, I mean, this has been a crazy couple months and an unprecedented couple months in terms of American politics.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She had a really sort of burst of momentum, you know, through her coalescing that support through the DNC, the Democratic National Convention where, you know, she officially took officially became the nominee through the debate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So in addition to sort of becoming more aggressive in her messaging about the former president, you see her doing media interviews all over the place.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Small stuff like 60 Minutes, but also non-traditional podcasts and radio shows, i mean, she's clearly trying to do something to shake the race up.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Very hard for Donald Trump to make that up.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The question is, will there be more liberals out numbering, which there are, it's 160 K. Will that make up for the bigger turnout from Trump: we know how he gets people to go to the polls and also the independent support that I think Trump will get in these swing States over Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Wow, this is crazy, and the fact that we saw this back to back, you've got Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Oh, that's great news, trump is doing a rally in Pennsylvania tonight.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So Trump is going to be doing a rally.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's doing great in early voting.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's flipping all these counties.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He survived two assassination attempts.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're still trying to kill him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is doing better, it's just like Virginia to where all the top counties, they're all Republican and Trump is doing very well in Pennsylvania right now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump can win the election without even knowing if he won Pennsylvania, if he wins some other important states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he wins Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, you know, you could still potentially make a call at that point, you know, maybe also Virginia as well.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I think this time Trump's going to be the winner in Florida, probably within an hour because they do the early the mail in voting early.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But again, Trump can win the election without Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is going to be better than 2020, so maybe there still is a chance that these states do get called at around two or three a.m. If Trump can win Pennsylvania by two or three points, I think it is possible.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The early voting looks very good, he's flipping counties and you've got Democrats, you know, signing artillery shells to be used as an escalation force to trend to World War Three.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's just the reality, we're going to be electing Trump because Trump is looking for a de-escalation of this war.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he's already talked to Zelensky.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's already talked to Putin.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so that's why at least with Trump, we're going to get some dialogue moving in the direction of potential peace as opposed to Democrats bragging about signing shells that are going to be used to, you know, in Russian territory.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Pennsylvania primaries took place today and the results were devastating for Donald Trump and expectations were exceeded for President Biden and Democrats.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"On the other hand, Donald Trump only got slightly over 80% of the votes, about 460,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"As Amar Moussa says, Trump is in deep trouble in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump at 54%, Nikki Haley at 46%, whereas President Biden in Delaware County at 97%, to Dean Phillips at 3%, you will see this consistent trend of Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Take a look at Chester County, Donald Trump, 49.2%, Nikki Haley, 45.2%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if you want to take a look at, look at Cumberland, Crawford, Donald Trump underperforming there as well.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is on track.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He said to get less than 70%.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's about 30% of the GOP casting a protest vote against Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is not winning Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's not winning this country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump decided to give an interview in with the, the biggest Pennsylvania local media station, Action News.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He says, how great it is that women's reproductive rights have been taken away because of his own action and how very happy people are that Donald Trump overturned Roe v Wade.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here's his interview with Pennsylvania's Action News, ABC six.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And as the Biden Harris headquarters pointed out on the right, this is Donald Trump spending today bragging about ending Roe v Wade on the left.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When you do that, we'll teach Donald Trump and extreme migrant Republicans a valuable lesson.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"On the other hand, the message that Donald Trump was talking about today was thousands of people were turned away from the courthouse in lower Manhattan.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then he calls the New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He calls her maggot Hagerman.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Trump says maggot Hagerman of the failing New York Times falsely reported that I was disappointed with the crowds.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So that's how Donald Trump spending his time.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And folks, the trends are overwhelming pro democracy and rejecting the madness, rejecting the chaos, rejecting the meanness, rejecting the wannabe fascism, rejecting the attack on our democracy, rejecting the loserness, the weirdness, all of that that Donald Trump represents and supporting on the other hand, President Biden and the pro democracy movement, normalcy, democracy, our Constitution, actually delivering things, policies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The beginning paragraph here in this article says when Vice President Kamala Harris ruled out her economic agenda, she went to Pittsburgh.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"When she unveiled her running mate, she went to Philly.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"When she had to pick a place for Obama's first fall rally, it was back to Pittsburgh.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump has earmarked the greatest share of his advertising budget for Pennsylvania's held more rallies in the state than in any other battleground since Ms. Harris joined the race, including two on Wednesday 3 in the last week.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"At the same time, Trump is such a unique figure that he's so much better and more appealing to Republican voters or even swing voters than in Oz or in a, or even a Dave McCormick, if you look at how much more he's running ahead of him, that maybe he's the only guy left in America who could still win of the state of Pennsylvania as a Republican.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's what helped Trump to spin his tails about how the election was stolen in, you know, Philadelphia, blah, blah, blah.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The other thing to point out about Pennsylvania is, you know, Trump just had his giant rally in Butler, Pennsylvania with Elon Musk.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We're turning to the site of that assassination attempt on his life and that's another like X factor in all of this, whether that helps to drive local enthusiasm for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"New York Times interviewed some local supporters who were really energized, inspired by, you know, his reaction in that moment and decided, you know, not only am I gonna vote for him, I'm gonna volunteer, I'm gonna be a like precinct captain or whatever.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The ads are just everywhere, and also like I said, the choice of those ads were Trump, every ad, immigration, immigration, immigration, immigration, migrant, immigration, and then there were some Dave McCormick ads, which tried to do that thing where he's like, Bob Casey's the real radical on abortion, but from Bob Casey and from Kamala, it was abortion all day long.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris finished 3 points ahead of Trump in this poll.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 48% and Donald Trump 50% of the vote.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump finished 2 points ahead of Harris in this poll.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 48% of the vote and Donald Trump 45%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris finished 4 points ahead of Trump in this poll.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris finished 5 points ahead of Trump in this poll.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote to Donald Trump 48%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris finished 1 point ahead of Trump in this poll.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 49% of the vote and Donald Trump 47%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris finished 2 points ahead of Trump in this poll.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 52% of the vote and Donald Trump 47%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 50% of the vote and Donald Trump 49%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, what has changed events-wise, just to put this in some context from then to now, this poll here where Harris was up five was taken just after that Harris-Trump debate in September.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There have been a number of events, Harris interviews.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A month ago, Harris was actually above water, as they say, 48 percent favorable and 45 percent negative a month ago.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So her numbers have moved in a negative direction.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She had a clear advantage on this basic question of the perception of the candidates.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
What are you seeing there: and I think that's another weight that Harris is sort of facing here.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So Harris weighted down by this, and Trump, there's sort of a bit of a positive reassessment of him since he's been president by some folks that might be helping him as well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They're saying those policies helped their families.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, Ana, he has really ramped up his rhetoric in these last weeks of the election, calling anyone who has opposed him or investigated him criminals, enemies from within.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Take a listen to some of what he said over the weekend.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And he's also heightened his rhetoric when it comes to immigration over the weekend, calling America, quote, occupied, calling the town of Aurora, Colorado conquered by Venezuelan gangs.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now he is here in Pennsylvania over the weekend.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He was in both Colorado and California, notably not battleground states, but he is here today in Montgomery County, one of those color counties around Philly as early voting is underway here so far.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Democrats taking more advantage of that option than Republicans of the former president did encourage his supporters over the weekend to vote early, vote by mail.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He clearly has these tendencies, strongman tendencies, but he is also saying that if he gets reelected, he will, he intends to act against his political opponents.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He mentioned that perhaps he should revoke CBS broadcasting license.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We know what he wants to do to legal and undocumented immigrants here in the United States.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I think the most disconcerting part when you hear the most aggressive, darkest themes from Donald Trump is that you also have to consider that it reflects the support of a large portion of this country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, he's never received over 50 percent, so it's not a majority of the country, but about 48 percent of the country is prepared to vote for Donald Trump and those messages.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That suggests a deep cultural rot in the country and Donald Trump is reflecting that.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, let Trump's running mate, JD Vance, he still won't give a direct answer on who won in 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Of course, Donald Trump and I believe there were problems in 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Did Donald Trump lose: ask the question and you know, that's the question.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You want to say rigged, you want to say he won.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, laVance seems to be trying to twist himself into a pretzel on this, trying to please Trump in the face.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But will this string of non-answers on 2020 or Trump's rhetoric that we're hearing, does any of that do damage with the average voter: well, the Harris campaign certainly seems to think that it does.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And the Harris campaign really clipped that moment, pushed it out on social media.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Voters, especially persuadable voters, want Harris to talk about the economy and immigration.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Those are areas where she could really draw separation with herself and Joe Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And that's something that she's particularly under pressure to do right now.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And yet she hasn't really been able to answer that question when it comes to her about how she would be different than Joe Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And that's probably in huge part because she respects the president.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's still part of the administration and really honors Biden for both choosing her to be vice president and endorsing her very early in this race.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Congressman Vance also said Trump's attorney general pick will be more important than his VP pick if he is elected here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He made the Supreme Court in his image and remade much of the federal circuit as well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He will use lawfare.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He will use the Department of Justice.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He will use the IRS to go after people.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And apparently he is going to round up undocumented immigrants in the country as well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Should that worry Republicans: well, Harris is certainly using this issue.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is something that she has a lot of credibility on.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She was talking about it before she was even running.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And it's a huge one that she has a difference from Joe Biden, who really, frankly, was uncomfortable talking about this issue.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I think we're really seeing her push that and this media blitz.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That was a huge focus of the interview that she did with Call Her Daddy, this very popular podcast, particularly in the South and the Midwest.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So the campaign is certainly trying to find ways for her to continue to message on this.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Congressman, part of the surge in Democratic enthusiasm once President Biden dropped out of this race was this idea that the race would become less a referendum on Biden, more of a referendum on Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That is what Republicans have unleashed on Vice President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Decide the poll of the revisionist history of his years, so many people adhere to the vice president's message that they're not going back.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
How is Kamala Harris going to play in PA: it's going to be difficult if she continues with who she's been up until this point.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, she is further left than Hillary.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She is a San Francisco Democrat that is again further left than the average Democrat in, in my home state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, she will probably hit somewhere where Obama hit or Hillary hit.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And you know, the other counties, that's where her challenge will be Erie County, North Hampton County, Cambria County.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's against fracking.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Unless she does a John Kerry, I was for the Iraq war before I was against it, before I was for it, before I was against it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, Selena, I want to my view of the world is there is only one selection for Kamala Harris for her running mate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump got a major victory in the state of Pennsylvania within the last 24 hours that could single handedly change the results of the election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign and the RNC secured a major victory with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court this week.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let's remember when it comes to October surprises, understand this with the Trump October surprise.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Don't you think Trump at that point being an incumbent, they would throw everything they had at Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's what I'm saying, but Trump's going to have a lot of stuff on Harris and they're saving it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He was like the second highest donor to their campaign saying that they manipulated the election with big tech.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's pretty typical there, this week, the Trump campaign and the RNC forced Waltz administration in Minnesota to inactivate over a thousand voters on the rolls who could be non-citizens or ineligible to vote.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And it's again, the same, the same script she used during the debate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Last night, Kamala Harris had a rally at like a preschool gym.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's how bad it's getting, but here she is.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So I mean, and she does the exact same thing in this and making life more affordable for people.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now everyone's for Kamala, but it's like they give they've given her a chip and the factory settings is this story.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is very well received with the Amish to give you an idea.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump created all of these voters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's amazing, i'm going to tell you, this is the first time I've seen a Trump sign being a flag being flown on the back of a buggy from the horse and buggy from the Amish country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"No matter what she says she's going to do for them, she's had nearly four years to do it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's the one that's caused all of this.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump won that by 29 and 24 points the last two elections.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Cumberland, Donald Trump won that by 18 and 10.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because if Kamala can't win Pennsylvania, she's not winning.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that's based on these two right here, Quinnipiac and the New York Times, which has Harris up five and four.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She is the Vice President of the United States for having a sake.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump needs over 60% of the white vote to win.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's just no other way around, he's got, if Trump could get 65% of the white vote, he's not losing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's people right here, so by far and away, the largest group they polled was the Kamala base, all right: it's pretty interesting to me.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So we have more women than men, more rich people than Trump's base and whites.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
White women making a lot of money are significantly higher in the heels up category than the other Trump category.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's Trump stuff.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
47% voted for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And yet in this case, Trump is still tied.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Vice President Kamala Harris will join President Biden in Pittsburgh, their first joint campaign event since he stepped aside, and she became the nominee.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
CBS News campaign reporter Aaron Navarro is joining us now with more on the Harris team's movements.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There's one big survey out Sunday, it's suggested Harris got no notable convention polling bounce, which I don't think is a complete surprise because, you know, once she shifted to the top of the ticket, there was this ground swell of enthusiasm, which, you know, one could say that would have been what happened after perhaps the DNC, instead she got it before.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But Trump is also a little bit ahead in some key issues when we're talking about economy, you know, the inflation border security.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"How is the Harris campaign kind of working to close the gap on some of these key issues: well, the Harris campaign stance is that they are still the underdogs in this race.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris really doesn't have that option.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's got to do both simultaneously, what do we know about how she's preparing: it's a truncated schedule.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's going to New Hampshire on Wednesday.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump's team is okay with it being muted, saying it's the same rules as the CNN one.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris over the weekend kind of go to Trump and saying that he believes that she believes his handlers don't want the mic to be on because they're afraid of what he might say.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The vice president, Kamala Harris, insist she won't ban fracking today despite claiming otherwise back in 2019.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So yesterday I went to the swing state of Pennsylvania to the town of Zelia, Nopal to speak with word energy workers who say they don't trust Harris and her flip flops on fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It's much easier to work under a Trump administration than this administration by far.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Haskemilla Harris holding a narrow one point lead within the margin of error for most polls.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But the last couple of polls you will note have Trump starting to take the lead back.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We begin with the race for the White House where former President Barack Obama hit the campaign trail for Kamala Harris in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania on Thursday.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I'm sorry gentlemen, I've noticed this especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down is a sign of strength.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Taking shots at the Republican presidential nominee, the former president called Donald Trump a whiny old billionaire who is obsessed with himself.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I've said it before, Donald Trump is a 78 year old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, he did add that Kamala Harris was in fact ready to be the next commander in chief and would do a fantastic job as president.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The 44th president known for his calm and cool demeanor expressed a burst of emotions rarely seen as he accused Donald Trump of threatening America's democracy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigned in battleground states with the Republican in Michigan as the Democrat visited Arizona.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"With just 25 days left until election day, a Reuters Ipsos poll shows Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in the suburbs for the first time.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
President Obama's appearance on the campaign trail showing support for Kamala Harris comes at a crucial time.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The race is still too close to call and the Harris campaign is deploying its big guns to help seal the deal.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Former President Bill Clinton is also expected to hit the campaign trail for Harris as both sides make their closing arguments to the voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yesterday, Donald Trump's town hall event just outside of Philadelphia was seemingly cut short when members of the crowd fainted.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump calling Kamala Harris not a smart woman.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris said that Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In fact, she played a video of one of his latest comments where he talked about having the military go after the enemy within.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He was talking about radical liberal people here in this country that set off a lot of alarm bells, not only on the left, but throughout the political world, hearing him talking about using the military potentially on American citizens.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris said he's talking about the fact that he considers anybody who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will an enemy of our country.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Earlier in the day, she released an economic plan that is tailored to black men, a key constituency that this campaign is a little bit concerned about right now.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She has been holding events that are primarily focused on winning over more black men, men she'll need if she wants to win this election in very close states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump, on the other hand, in a town hall outside of Philadelphia held an event where he was focused on support from suburban women.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There were a couple of people who needed medical assistance, and he commented on that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And after just a few questions from South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem in a planned Q&A, he basically cut off the question and answer phase and just called for music to be played for the next 40 minutes or so.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He just stood there on the stage, kind of swaying, dancing a little bit to some of his favorite songs from Pavarotti, from Guns N' Roses, and no one could quite understand even some puzzled faces in the room about what exactly was going on.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris will be looking to do really well in not just Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and their suburbs, but also in some of the smaller cities.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump will more be looking to run up the score, especially in more rural and ex-urban areas in the center of the state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala doesn't give a frack about you.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's accusing Vice President Kamala Harris of flip-flopping on fracking, which she now says she will not ban.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is making her own play for rural Republicans with ads like this one.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What's up, guys, boy, Benny: not all Trump parades are made equal.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Some are just built different, like, Amish Trump parades in Pennsylvania with horse and buggy and Trump flag.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is your president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If you like it or not, he's the energy you had with Barack.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is going to be strong in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is going to be strong, and that's we have to respect that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
A ton of his planned or recent stops have been in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What does Trump say when he's there: he's just freaking hilarious.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Why do you think people love Trump: your job, which is a good job, an energy job.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But if you don't put Trump in, you're not going to have any energy jobs in here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You know that she's never said frack in her life just a short while ago when she realized her poll numbers were dying in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Thank you very much, great job, the only time Kamala Harris said frack was when she saw her poll numbers in Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In Pennsylvania, Trump winning by 30 plus points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In Georgia, Trump winning by 20 plus points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In Arizona, Trump winning by 30 plus points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's perfect, yeah, kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump are tied in battleground states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But guess what: just at time of publishing Donald Trump leading now in the Quinnipiac poll.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What does that mean: it means now now corporate polls are showing that Donald Trump is back, baby.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump's back ahead, now starts the surge.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Hey, Donald Trump is your president.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if you like it or not, he's the energy you had with Barack.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because you know, this Trump train don't stop.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Today Kamala Harris unveiling a new plan to cover in-home health care for seniors.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It's not one of the giveaways that Kamala Harris is promising or for that matter some of the pandering that Donald Trump has done.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It could be longer, i wonder if there might be some motivation to change that law, Senator, when Donald Trump claims victory at nine thirty at night on election day, are you worried about reliving this again: look, I think it's a it's a valid concern.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If if Donald Trump does not win the election, do you think he's going to admit that he lost: i don't think so.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, we have a new poll that came out today from Harvard Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Not to be confused with Kamala Harris, but the poll shows that this race nationally is a dead heat.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They have Harris at 49%, they have Trump at 48% in their poll.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And this might be the final poll they end up dropping too.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But do keep in mind that that's good for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If Kamala Harris is at 49% in the popular vote and Trump is at 48, she's probably going to be cooked in the electoral college, all things considered.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Make no mistake, Donald Trump in the 2020 election, he didn't even get 47% nationally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In 2016, he only got 45.9% of the popular voters, somewhere in that range.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But already right now, he sits at 48% in this poll, which is absolutely huge.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He was never polling this high and the electoral college is what dictates the outcome.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So Donald Trump is a two-point lead in the states that actually matter.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
A lot of people really aren't saying Trump's going to be like winning any of those states by like three or four points to really skew the average.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is a good poll for Donald Trump because if that's the average in those battleground states, that means that Donald Trump is probably going to end up winning the election, especially given the top line nationally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's true, i mean, the head pollster there is a Trump supporter wants Donald Trump to win.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's at 50 percent and Kamala Harris is down there at 47 percent.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But here's the deal, the New York Times still doesn't understand how to pull the rust belt, especially when Donald Trump is on the ballot.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And do you really think that Harris is going to do better than Joe Biden by nearly two points in the state of Pennsylvania, current Harris compared to Biden in 2020: the answer is probably not.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
You would probably anticipate Donald Trump to do better.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is done, but now Donald Trump leads in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's the favorite even in Michigan.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's polling by up by 1% in the state of Michigan.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's the clear favorite even in Wisconsin.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
A lot of people talk about the shy Trump voter.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think it's more the hidden Trump voter.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I think the shy Trump voter was always kind of like a false way of explaining it, especially as pollsters nowadays typically don't poll by phone as much as they used to.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And what we do know is that when you look at the polling now compared to the polling then Donald Trump is in a much much stronger position.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's not like he's barely in a stronger position.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's in a significantly stronger position and I'm not anticipating a six-point polling error again in Wisconsin.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But do I think you could see Trump win the state by like two to three: absolutely.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They're showing Trump up.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And even the New York Times could only pull a Harris plus one.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But Donald Trump maintains himself to be in a very solid position.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"A lot of the people that are registering to vote to vote against Donald Trump, they're not typically going to be registered as Republicans.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when it comes to a state like Pennsylvania where Trump is expanding his lead, it's just common sense.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Use your common sense, do you think that Kamala Harris is going to do as well with these white working class voters, you know, compared to somebody like Joe Biden: of course not.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There's even an argument to be made, she may not do as well as somebody like Hillary, you know, who did very poorly with these people.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In fact, she may do worse in some places.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It's true because she's even less of a solid candidate to appeal to these people in terms of that demographic.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
You could easily see Donald Trump make massive gains.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, you're talking about close to 10 point gains with these types of voters, and that would put him at 50 percent.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And even if he does lose some with, you know, white college educated voters, he loses some of these supporters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's probably not going to lose a ridiculous amount of them from what we understand if they were able to stick with him twice in terms of the black voters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's likely set to gain some.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"We could debate how much, but he's likely to gain some.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's likely to gain with Hispanic voters as well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Is Harris going to do as well as Biden did in those places: no, and that's the majority of the country because the majority of the country, they don't live in those upscale suburbs.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And when you look at these polls, even some of the Bellwether polls, oh, Trump is up in Erie.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's up in Northampton.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I know the polls didn't have him up by like three to four and I'm not even saying he's going to win the state by this margin.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But is it possible that he does well enough: it's absolutely possible.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris is not really gaining a lot from 2020 and there's a lot of room that she apparently would have to grow.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's not exactly getting it, even if she's improving slightly.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And I don't even think Harris is really that strong of a candidate when it comes to these like, you know, millennial men, for example, which, you know, typically when they grow up as well, they're going to be, you could argue, moving to the right.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You've been listening to Vice President Kamala Harris at a campaign rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, delivering some of her sharpest and strongest attacks to date against Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She went right after his comments about using the military against American citizens who he calls, quote, his words, the enemy from within.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And she even played those comments on a big screen in the arena.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She also said, which I wrote down, she's he's referring to anyone who doesn't support him.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Anyone who will not bend to his will, those are part of her remarks.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, I heard them as some of her strongest remarks, rebuke of what is at stake here, of the threat of Trump to date.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
When you hear and I want to ask you something that she's kind of asking us all to do.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So let's talk about what he's saying and what it means.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When you hear Trump talk about the enemy from within, what do you hear: i hear echoes of Victor Orban, of Vladimir Putin, of Nicholas Maduro.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he's already done the first two, and now he's coming after the third, which is toâ€”instead of us being opponents, he's calling us enemies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when he calls other Americans the enemy, when he says that he should send the National Guard or even the military after American citizens, he is doing his best to say that the only way to survive as a country is to essentially abdicate responsibility to the Constitution.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump has been part of that.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But so have the policies he plans to reinstate.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Access to capital is one of the strongest barriers to starting your own small business, and he will eliminate that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When you hear him say he doesn't believe in DEI, what he's saying is he does not believe that people of color, namely young black men, should have access to capital.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What he has said and what he will do is return us to a time when young black men are walled off from opportunity.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, what he is willing to do is to lie about his intentions.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if you listen to his lies, it's like listening to Santa Claus.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's what Kamala Harris is doing.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's saying we have not done everything we need to.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But she has a plan to address those challenges.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her willingness to speak directly to a community is a sign of respect.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What that is saying is that this is a population that needs to hear more, and she's responding to that need by answering the call and putting out an agenda and saying, here I am, ask me questions, I'm ready to serve you.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And with Harris only recently becoming the Democratic nominee, voters say they want to hear more about her policy proposals.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"On Capitol Hill, Trump allies advised him to steer clear of personal attacks.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I think President Trump would be wise to explain how he would change the country, stay away from the personal stuff, talk about policy differences.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Democratic leaders expect Harris will lean into her experience as a prosecutor to go after Trump and detailed differences between the two.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A stark contrast in two candidates, one who's a seasoned prosecutor who's going to make her case and one who is a felon.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
CBS News has learned she even had a phone call with the 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to get her advice on debating Donald Trump.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Sources say Trump meanwhile has had less formal debate prep, though he has been getting some help from Florida Congressman Matt Gates and also former Democratic Congressman Tulsi Gabbard.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You may remember debated Harris back during 2019 Democratic primary season.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Liz back to you, Natalie, thank you, now we talked to some Bay Area voters ahead of tonight's debate and one person told us Trump's rhetoric specifically around immigration is too divisive.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If Trump wins, he's always anti, you know, like kick, let's kick everybody out and build a brick wall.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Governor Newsom is expected to be in Harris's spin room tonight.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The Trump campaign said its goal is to quote prosecute Kamala Harris, dangerously liberal record.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They also said Trump knows Pennsylvania voters better than her.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He understands the issues that they are facing.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He delivered for them in his first term.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He supported our energy independence.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He supported good paying energy jobs in the fracking industry here in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Trump campaign also said that Trump knows Harris's record well from her time as attorney general of California and San Francisco's district attorney and is ready to discuss her policies.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Meantime Harris used the joint campaign appearance to say U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris' remarks concur with the White House's months-long opposition to the company's planned sale to Nippon Steel of Japan.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, is scheduled to be sentenced in his New York hush money case on the 18th.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Zooming out, Harris has a slight edge nationally.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Over the weekend, there was another scare near a Trump rally, this time in California.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Secret Service says the incident did not put Trump or anyone at the rally in danger and so far no federal charges have been filed.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Major, this will be Harris' eighth visit in western Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Why is she honing in on this particular area of the state: so, Lindsay, anyone from Pennsylvania will tell you that the eastern part of the state is more east coast, more mid-Atlantic.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And there are counties around Allegheny County that Trump carried.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There are three counties right around that that Trump carried 60-40.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, this area is when you want to get Allegheny County if you're Harris and you want to lose by less in those pro-Trump surrounding counties.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Harris unveiled a new policy aimed at helping black men.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, one of the things that Harris campaign is learning is that in 2016, this was a complete blind spot for Hillary Clinton's campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris campaign is trying to address that as well.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"President Trump is ever so slightly chipping away at Harris's lead, even though polling is effectively even.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He said to me, the Trump campaign has an explanation.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It may not have the best explanation, but it's offering things in very sharp contrasting language.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The sharp contrast are not coming in through as clearly from the Harris campaign and voters who are still on the fence like that sharper clearer explanation, at least so far from the Trump campaign gravitating just a tad in that direction over Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"More than 230 doctors, nurses and health care professionals are calling on Trump to release his records.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Harris campaign has a very definite attitude that former president Trump, by denying the 2020 election and rhetoric on the campaign trail so far, makes him unfit.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And if you watch Trump rallies, as I do a fair amount, you see he's not the candidate he was in 2020, certainly not as sharp as he was in 2016.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Harris campaign is trying to make that overall health, fitness, mental acuity argument a subtext to this campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So Anthony, we just spoke with major about the push from the Harris campaign to court, particularly black male voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What does your polling suggest: well, in our estimates, Harris is getting the same percent of support among black voters that Joe Biden got in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The first one is, does her campaign think she needs to get an even higher percentage of that: that we'll see.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And this is what I mean, look at Harris voters and what they say about the economy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But nearly nine in 10 Trump voters say that it is bad.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris voters, more likely than Trump voters to say that the U.S. stock market is higher now.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And the ratio of those who say it's higher to lower is much more for Harris voters than for Trump voters, even excluding those people who say they don't know.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Look at this, nine in 10 Harris voters say, yeah, yeah, hurricane relief is going to people impacted by the hurricane.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But two thirds of Trump voters say that it is not.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Look at how many more Trump voters believe that there's going to be widespread fraud in this election.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Many more Trump voters say that after all is said and done, that they should challenge the results if the other side wins much more in comparison than to Harris voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"For Trump voters, a majority say they feel that efforts to promote gender equality have been going too far.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's a majority, but look at Harris voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Look, I want to see Kamala Harris deliver her vision for a future for all Americans, particularly for young Americans.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I think she has done that in her economic policies that she's laid out.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I think she's done that talking about investments in climate change, reducing fossil fuel emissions and investments across the board in our generation concerning student loans and housing affordability as well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So I think Kamala Harris needs to deliver that message to the American people and deliver that message to young voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Ryan, same question for you, what are you hoping to hear from Trump in Tuesday's debate: yes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm super proud to cast my first ever ballot for President Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right now, inflation and prices are up, wages and savings are down under the disastrous policies of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"President Trump, in his tenure in the White House, was a lot more affordable, and the American dream was in reach for our generation.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so a vote for President Trump is a vote for affordability, prosperity, and the American dream for my generation.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's abortion bans are going into implementation state after state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You look at what's happening in states like Kentucky with these extreme abortion bans because of Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now, with former President Donald Trump found guilty of 34 felony counts, how will his unprecedented criminal conviction affect the upcoming election: well, from one end of the state to the other, KDK and our sister station CBS News Philadelphia are teaming up today to listen to you and take the pulse of Pennsylvania voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, from my perspective, it seemed like he's hands on with a lot of things.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The verdict in the Trump trial, does that move you anyway: honestly, no.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"President Kamala Harris, i do want to say because I know she's listening backstage.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This matters more than anything right now, the stakes of this election with the statement being made by Donald Trump, I felt like I had to be here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And what would you hope to take away from this whole situation after the rally is all said and done: well, I think the reason Trump is here is show strength, that he will not be chased away.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The attacks will not stop him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I'm like, so is it not honorable for Donald Trump to stand up after someone trying to take his life, raise his fist and let all of his supporters know that he is leading the charge, is the danger any different when a king would rush straight into a bunch of men with spears: so maybe you can criticize Donald Trump for that and say he's dumb, but there's a big difference between someone who's willing to sacrifice and someone who is stupid.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump knew the dangers and standing up was to send a message to the world.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He won't back down and coming back here is very similar, is that what motivates you to come back here: because some people think the people, the rally goers, the attendees, the guests are crazy for showing up to a place where somebody tried to kill another person.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Is he an individual that motivates you to keep going, like what's that fire, what keeps you up at night: you know, I've never been the biggest fan of Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump was just a good president and he's the best president of my lifetime.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And the bar was really low, but I like Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think he's a good guy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think he's got character defects.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Nobody's perfect, but to see his foreign policy in action, to see his domestic policy, it's undeniable.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's the right guy for the job.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm very excited for 2028, but when Trump says, I'm going to come back to the place where I took a bullet, nearly died, that is a powerful statement.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And with that being said, seeing Donald Trump's willingness to come back to a place where he nearly died, I'm getting off the podcast chair and I'm coming out for the first time in a few years to one of these rallies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I'm going to try and be as influential as I can to inspire people to be as brave as Trump is in the face of taking a bullet.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I said, do you like RFK Jr.: and he goes, yeah, I love him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I said, RFK Jr. says that if Donald Trump wins, he wins.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You tell me you hate Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But a vote for Kamala Harris, what's her party bringing you, dick Cheney and Liz Cheney: come on.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So please, if you don't like Donald Trump, totally get it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So Libby, let's talk about Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he's headed to Georgia.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This comes, of course, as we know, Trump is struggling to close that gender gap with Vice President Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"After that town hall, he has a rally here in Atlanta, Georgia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let me ask you about that, because I know you've been covering the Trump campaign for a long time.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Can you tell me about that, what the campaign is saying this morning about what the former president was signaling: trump was a town hall in Oaks, Pennsylvania last night.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But the Trump campaign is calling it, quote, a love fest.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Maybe Harris Faulkner, the Fox News moderator, will keep it more on message.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But last night, definitely more bizarre Trump event that we've seen this election cycle.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Vice President Harris has been replaying some of former President Trump's words that he's used at his rallies and in certain interviews that indicate that he would use the military, for example, to go after his political opponents or leftists.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In other words, talking about immigration, sure, which a lot of people say is a problem, but also saying that he's going to use the powers of the federal government to go after his political enemies.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I wonder if the Trump campaign has responded to the vice president's use of his own words at her rallies to rally voters to her cause.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She says these are the words of an autocrat, someone who is threatening to use the military in this way.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He talks about Nancy Pelosi and Harris herself.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So this is why the vice president Kamala Harris just says, let Trump's talk, speaking, do the arguments for them.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"They think that he can dig his own hole, if you will.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And last time Trump had a rally in Atlanta, I will say he told this huge crowd of supporters that Trump, that Kemp, excuse me, is disloyal.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We'll see if he changes that messaging three weeks out with the hugely popular governor and other Republicans in the state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He'll be watching and trying to make sure that there's no efforts to overturn the election again.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This time, as you say, he is still under criminal charges here in Fulton County for that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's at 49% to 45% for Harris among independents.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Back in 2020, he only had 44%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris is underperforming with them.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is also underperforming against minority voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Biden received 82% support in 2020, but right now Harris is looking at 59%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Unsurprisingly, Trump is leading Harris among men, 54-44, while Harris is leading Trump among women, 55-43.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When Marist polled other states, Harris is having a five-point lead over Trump in Michigan, and I believe only a 1% lead in Wisconsin, but with Pennsylvania, it's really coming down to the wire here.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If you go back and look at the Real Clear Politics polling average, the last eight or so polls that were conducted, I should say, since the debate on September 10th, shows that Harris was up as much as five points, according to Quinnipiac.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But it seems that that post-debate bump that a lot of analysts expected that she would have is pretty much gone now.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That has Trump up 1%, overall, the average of the last 10 or so polls shows Harris is only up 1%, as compared to President Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He was up 4% on this day, September 19th in 2020, and Hillary Clinton was up 6.6 points in 2016.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So you're definitely seeing Harris underperforming Clinton and Biden in big ways.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 48 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 46 percent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 48 percent each.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 47 percent each.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 49 percent each.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump received 46 percent each.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 47 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 48 percent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 50 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 48 percent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 52 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 48 percent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 50 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 44 percent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 49 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 46 percent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 51 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 45 percent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris received 51 percent of the vote and Donald Trump 46 percent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"First, I wanna ask which candidate is leading so far: currently Trump is in the lead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"2020, Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now I should mention, Donald Trump recently posted on Truth Social.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He said he was a head of Harris when it comes to the polls.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He just did the other day on the Team Trump Facebook page.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The vice president heading to a couple areas of Pennsylvania that Trump won in 2020.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So what in the campaign math makes you think that this is the best strategy right now to spend time in Trump country: well, thanks for having me.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Ian, Trump has been leaning into that baseless conspiracy theory about migrants eating pets.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In the first five minutes, Vice President Harris talked about her plan to expand small businesses and give new small business owners a $50,000 tax deduction to help them afford to start a business.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She talked about her plans to take on grocery pricing and housing pricing and bring those down for the American people.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She talked about reproductive freedom and how she wants to protect it and sign a law that codifies Roe v. Wade.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"When you talk about trying to expand who she's reaching, we have heard from some undecided voters that we've talked to that even after the debate, they still don't know enough about the vice president's plans for the future and how her vision is different from President Biden's.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, she was able to do it in the debate to talk about her own proposals and what her own priorities would be as president.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She said, you know, I'm not President Biden and I'm certainly not Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And she's offering her own set of proposals and vision for the country.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And what the next 50 some odd days will do is allow her to get out on the campaign trail and share those priorities directly with the American people.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so what she's going to be doing is continuing to explain how she wants to bring down those prices, how she wants to create new small businesses in this country, the things that are her real economic priorities that may be a little bit different than what President Biden has proposed and emphasized, but speaks to what she will do as president with her priorities.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Can you point to those specific differences on those key issues: well, for example, just a couple of weeks ago in her plan to support small businesses, she talked about the investment climate that we need in order to help entrepreneurs start small businesses and grow.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She thought that was too high, so she suggested a lower rate of 28 percent as the number for that, because it can help incentivize more investment in entrepreneurs and startups in America.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And that's because she really believes in sparking growth among small businesses in this country.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And when the vice president talks about her history as a prosecutor, for example, and who she was fighting to protect and who she was defending, taking on the big banks to get 20 billion dollars for homeowners who got screwed during the during the financial crisis, you know, taking on gangs who were smuggling people and drugs across the border.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That is her history and record that she brings to her values that she would prioritize on policy as president.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I have to, i wasn't happy with Biden-Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris won, as far as I'm concerned.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She was direct, she was concise.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She had more talking points ready.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump really didn't, and she got under his skin, and she knew how to do it, and it worked.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I didn't like that she didn't answer direct questions about her policies and direct questions about what happened in the last 3 1,000 years that she should have been part of.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She talked around it, and I want a more direct answer.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I like how she brought up multiple things that she wanted to do for policy, and people keep saying, I don't know why she doesn't want to talk about policy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's an M. Wickel.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I'm so cheer-girl, i'm here for the 21 months.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The debate last night, and Kamala really trashed Trump good.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He would not vote for Trump a third time.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She's been in office this whole time with Biden, so she could have done something for this whole entire four years.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Carmela, grandpa: or however long, she could do something now, too, so she's not doing anything.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So it just doesn't really make sense to me as to why, if she really wanted to help the country out, why would she have the ability to do that right now: she's in office.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She would destroy Trump in debate, highlight choice as an issue, energize our base and bring back young voters, give us a generational time change its time.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I bet he's so unbearably smug right now deserves to be.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, i mean, every single Congress person, I think, who spoke up and vouched for her early on, they're allowed to be smug.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris has recently faced criticism for her limited media presence since taking over from President Biden as the Democratic candidate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her recent interview with CNN's Dana Bash, alongside running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, saw no major missteps, but Kennedy's critique highlights ongoing concerns about her leadership.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This development comes amid growing criticism of both Governor Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris for their limited engagement with the press since Harris's presidential campaign launched in July.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It took more than six weeks for Harris and Walz to sit down for their first official interview, which aired as a pre-taped segment with CNN's Dana Bash on Thursday.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"To date, Harris has yet to hold a formal press conference, raising further concerns about transparency and accessibility as the campaign heats up.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Appointed by President Biden in March 2021 to address the southern border crisis, Harris has faced criticism for her limited engagement with border issues.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her positions on key issues, such as health care for illegal immigrants, fracking and policing have evolved over time, leading to questions about her consistency as she prepares for the upcoming election season.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"More on that in a moment, but Donald Trump's cognitive decline was on display.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here, Donald Trump told people to go out and vote on January 5th.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He said, he said January 5th.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I'm a big, and then kind of like in the middle of his speech, Kristi Noem's like, all right, so here are the songs that you wanted us to play.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And then Donald Trump's like, all right, let's play the song.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then he just stands there for like minutes listening to these songs.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he like just kind of bobs.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm just going to show you small portions of it because this goes on for minutes as he's bobbing around and these songs are playing here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Then he talks about, he says he knows guns, but just listen to what he's saying.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then someone has a medical event at the event and Donald Trump says the individual should lose weight.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He mocks the person who's having an emergency in the crowd.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Here's the individual, by the way, who Donald Trump yells at and tells to lose weight as he's being stretchered out of the rally.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's what the individual looks like, here's what Donald Trump says.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is a good person.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You know, then Donald Trump spreads more lies about Springfield, Ohio.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he says that the migrants who are there lawfully are actually illegal immigrants, spreading more racism and xenophobia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump then tries to talk about gas and cooking.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I don't even know what he's even saying here because, again, he's really mentally having real issues.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then Donald Trump takes the mic again.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He says he's going to take another question, then changes his mind and then calls Democrats evil.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He then tells his production crew to play the YMCA and then starts dancing to the YMCA.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris made it very clear on this.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's ready, she has been making this clear for a long time.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's ready to be commander in chief and she released her medical records.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Donald Trump said that he would release his numbers.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He would release his his medical records.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look, he says now, I think he forgot to do it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's been forgetting things.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Kamala Harris is right on this.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's a nearly 80 year old man.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's ranting and rambling until people get bored and leave his rallies.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He went on there and he suggested that he is going to send the military against the enemy from within.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In other words, Americans who don't support him.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Just to be clear, if any of your neighbors or friends or anybody thinks about that, you know, he's talking about he's talking about you.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's talking about you.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's talking about someone who comes to a rally to express their love and their commitment to our democracy.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump sees that as an enemy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So look, if anybody wants to pretend that this is a normal conversation that Donald Trump is having, just dispel that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, said, no one has ever been more dangerous to this country than Donald Trump, and he is a fascist to his core.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let that sink in and don't be a damn bit afraid of saying it, because that's exactly who he is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's exactly who he is, but here's the thing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And we can do that by making Kamala Harris the president of the United States.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And here's Vice President Kamala Harris, and here she plays a montage of Donald Trump clips showing his own words.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Here, play this clip, and so after all these years, we know who Donald Trump is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He is someone who will stop at nothing to claim power for himself.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he tells us what he would do if he is elected president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So here tonight, I will show you one example of Donald Trump's worldview and intentions.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He has worked to prevent women from making their own health care decisions and threaten your fundamental freedoms and rights.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I think that if there's a tie in Pennsylvania, like in the statistical polling, I think that Trump will win.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Over the last couple of months he's either like mildly ahead or mildly behind, but it's like within one point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think that he can win in a statistical tie.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He was not polling that well in 2016 and he managed to pull off a win in the state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It wasn't by a huge margin and it was close, but he did win.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think that he wins on a tie.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In fact, I think that he wins if he's a couple of points behind in the state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If the trajectory of the race though remains roughly stable, I would expect Trump to win Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He would also get Georgia and North Carolina.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's pretty much the election, he seems to be far ahead in Arizona, which is hilarious.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And this, by the way, is terrible news for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She goes to the border, as literal borders are, and doesn't really want to take questions from journalists, of course, about this.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And basically just sloganeers the entire time, trump has put forth concrete plans for what he wants to do.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris has borrowed Trump's homework a couple of times, but otherwise, she has, at this point, and this is inexplicable, even for the Kamala Harris campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Even for her, though, it seems odd that more than half of her actual policy positions are literally borrowed from her opponent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Maybe if you go back to the Andrew Jackson days, I'm sure there was weird shit that happened then like him randomly deciding to duel somebody, something like that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It'll go over so well, i mean, I'm looking at the political situation, they're like, what the fuck is going on at this point: and I think that Trump wins.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I can't imagine the American people are dumb enough to vote for Kamala Harris, by and large, number one.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump will conduct diplomacy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's getting roundly criticized by the liberals for doing so as well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's like Trump says, hey, I want to get a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris understands that government must work in partnership with the business community.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If you're a middle class family or a family trying to get into the middle class, Kamala Harris is going to cut your taxes.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If you're getting squeezed by prescription drug prices, Kamala Harris is going to take on Big Pharma.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And she's chosen the person that she believes can help her win this election and that she believes can help her best govern.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There have also been some reports that your predecessor, former lieutenant governor and now Senator John Federman expressed concerns about Governor Shapiro to the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And I know, that sounds crazy, like, wait, what: according to some people, Kamala Harris is up by 15 points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's gonna win in a landslide.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is coming from someone that covers the Harris campaign for NBC News.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And she said, the polling is so bad in Pennsylvania, that not even Josh Shapiro could deliver the state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Maybe she's wrong, like, maybe this is just misinformation, whatever.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Look at this, on the RCP average right now, Trump is up by two points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, trump plus two, despite Trump, quote unquote, collapsing everywhere else, he's still up by two points in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So while the national and even statewide polling in some states has gotten worse for Trump, it seems like in Pennsylvania, it stayed about the same.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's up by around two to three points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's coming from public polls, but not only that, a couple days ago, we heard from not just people at the Trump campaign, but from the Harris campaign, their own polling.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And apparently the internals have Trump up by around two to five points in Pennsylvania as of now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It could, but as of now, the public polling is showing a Trump plus two lead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Because if even Josh Shapiro couldn't save her, she's in deep trouble.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And not only that, Trump's at 48%, except for one poll, he's at 48, 49, and 50% of the vote.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, so he's already about to crack 50%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, I want to go over why this is a big deal that Harris is potentially in deep trouble in Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So let's just say, okay, Minnesota, Virginia, Harris wins those states, New Hampshire, Maine, whatever.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Okay, let's say Trump carries Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"At this point in time, he just needs Georgia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he's the next president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You just can't, and on top of that, the same Eternals, they have Trump up by Wisconsin by a decent amount.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now it's really, if Trump carries one state, just one, even Nevada, he would be at 270.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris could win every other state, which this map's not going to happen, but in this scenario, Trump's is victorious.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's why it's such a big deal if Pennsylvania goes towards Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's why I think the Harris campaign, they're kind of freaking out because if Josh Shapiro wasn't enough to save them, how are you going to win, how are you supposed to win Pennsylvania: if not, even Josh Shapiro would be enough to win the presidency.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that's the problem here, the pathway to the presidency for Harris is all but gone because now she could afford to lose maybe one more state like Wisconsin or a Nevada.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But after that, she cannot lose a single state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, does this mean Trump's going to win Pennsylvania by 10 points: no.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But if he's up by two to three points as of now, which by the way, this should be Harris's best polling right now, especially in August.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This should be when her polling's at her and it's absolute peak.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So she's already down by two to three points and this is when she should be pulling her best.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And if Trump is really winning Pennsylvania, do you really think he's losing Wisconsin: i doubt it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So really at this point, Harris cannot lose any more states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That doesn't happen, we just got to see what happens, but the Harris campaign, they're a lot more trouble than some people think if they're down in Pennsylvania by two to three points because how are you supposed to come back from that, especially if Trump's already at 49% that means with undecideds allocated, Trump's probably above 50% of vote.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I really don't know what the Harris campaign does if they lose Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If she just gives up in Pennsylvania, which I don't think she will, but if she's losing Pennsylvania by two to three points as of now and even Josh Shapiro wouldn't have saved them.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Does anyone really expect her to win: i don't know.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I guess it's possible that maybe she wins every other state except Pennsylvania, but I don't see that occurring.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
If Trump is still up by like three to four points in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, he's probably the clear favorite at that point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now the most recent New York Times, Siena poll shows Kamala Harris at 43% of the vote in the Northeast part of the state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Whereas a lot of the places where Donald Trump has increased his vote over the last two election cycles, you're seeing kind of a stagnant population and in some places even going down in population.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So that means less voters for Donald Trump, more voters overall, that's going to add to the overall number.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If she gets 43 percent or higher in the Northeast part of the state, game over.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's done, kamala Harris wins.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Whereas Trump almost kind of invites it on himself where he does so many.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And J.D, vance has been on TV constantly, and he does a lot of press conferences as well that it's a kind of double edged sword to caramelize not giving herself the opportunity to make mistakes, but at the same time, it kind of cuts off access to who she is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She's statistically tied with Donald Trump and a bunch of battleground states in recent polls, including in Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And within that several thousand votes, we saw some polling that came out from the New York Times Sienna poll, which is generally kind of respected as one of the one of the better polls out there, which showed that Harris has a four point lead on Trump, which but at the same time, it said that they were tied nationally.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And if you take into reporting from our own Selena Zito, who basically kind of crisscrosses Pennsylvania the whole time, feels to be that there there's Kamala still got a lot of work to do there if she's going to win it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He had Long Island.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Sorry, he he went and did a thing at a crypto cafe and then moved on to this rally in Long Island.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And, you know, I was thinking, why is he kind of going after New York: because it's a blue state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I sort of understand the crypto bit of it because he's obviously made a play for that that industry.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But I would have thought that Trump would want to purely focus on these crucial swing states.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, he's obviously been in Pennsylvania a lot and Trump is somewhat kind of omnipresent and he's never off your TV.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's never not posting on on a truth social.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So he is everywhere, and he has paid a lot of lip service to those states in the past.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Maybe, but yeah, there just seemed to be a kind of strange lack of focus from his campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And for his sake, hopefully it doesn't cost him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris, as we kind of have covered, is in this virtually tied race right now.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She she doesn't have a lot more opportunities to rise in the polls.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, whereas you mentioned Donald Trump's kind of scattershot right now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he were to get on message and start campaigning where he needs to, he has some opportunities for growth.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But she's run a fairly flawless campaign so far and still isn't budging.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, where is her opportunity to rise: well, it's a great question.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I don't know if she does have many more opportunities, if any.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The debate, I think we saw with her own eyes, I think she did pretty well against him.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I think she won that comfortably, but it didn't seem to be reflected in some of the focus groups that came out after.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I think when you say she's run a flawless campaign, it's because it's mistake free one, I guess, is a better way.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, it's mistake free, but it's because she's not giving those opportunities to go mistake free.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's given hardly any interviews thus far.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's she can very rarely.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I don't think she's done a press conference as far as I can recall.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And J.D, vance has been on TV constantly and he does a lot of press conferences as well.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That it's a kind of double edged sword to caramelize not giving herself the opportunity to make mistakes, but at the same time, it kind of cuts off access to who she is.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And ultimately, you're sort of relying on, OK, she may be doing the old TikTok here and there maybe for Gen Z or whatever.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So I don't know if Kamala really kind of has many more opportunities.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They don't seem to want to do another debate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She certainly has shown no indication that she's going to go on a freewill interview spree.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So the fact that somebody said even recently, like I guess Kamala changed her opinion about fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He seemed to enjoy it as well He's heading to Chicago for an interview with Bloomberg News today, and then later to Georgia another battleground Robin All right, Tara.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Specifically, there are concerns about Nikki Liu, Harris's campaign manager in the state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So if the Harris campaign can't win over Philly, they're in big trouble.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Really: yeah, like there's this underlying sense that this lack of engagement with local leaders, it's a pattern for the Harris campaign, not just limited to Philadelphia.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And is the Harris campaign doing that: well, based on this article, there are definitely some doubts.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You know, it's interesting though, because the article does mention that like financially, the Harris campaign is in a good spot.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Exactly, yeah, and I think that's what some people are worried about with the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Because time is running out, with the election just weeks away, is there enough time for the Harris campaign to salvage their chances in Pennsylvania, or is this a sign of larger problems within the campaign: it's hard to say for sure.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Will Donald Trump maintain his influence, or has Kamala Harris seized the moment to turn the tide: stick around.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It shows Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by two points, with Harris polling at 49% and Trump at 47%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This narrow margin reflects a competitive race, with Trump staying within striking distance, showcasing his resilience and ability to maintain strong support in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Next, another BSG, gS strategy group poll conducted over the same period September 19 to 25, with the same for 170 for likely voters, reveals Harris leading Trump by a single point, with Harris at 50% and Trump at 49%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This razor-thin margin demonstrates that Pennsylvania is highly competitive, and Trump remains a formidable challenger capable of gaining ground.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Moving up, a morning consult poll conducted between September 19 to 25, with a sample of 993 registered voters, shows Harris leading Trump by six points, polling at 50% compared to Trump's 44%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Though Harris holds a decent lead, Trump's numbers still suggest that his campaign is maintaining a strong base, especially if turnout shifts toward more committed likely voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In another morning consult poll from the same date September 19 to 25, surveying 993 registered voters, Harris leads Trump by three points, polling at 49% to Trump's 46%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This poll shows a closer race, indicating that Trump is capable of gaining more support among registered voters as the election date nears.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris's lead in this poll is significant, but Trump's ability to secure 45% of the vote indicates that his core supporters remain engaged and enthusiastic.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A second morning consult poll from the same date September 19 to 25 and the same 920 for likely voters mirrors the previous result, with Harris leading by five points, 51% to Trump's 46%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This consistent result suggests that Harris is performing well in Pennsylvania, but Trump's sustained support shows that he still poses a strong challenge.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Moving up to the at-lassing tell poll, conducted between September 20 and 25 with 1,775 likely voters, Trump leads Harris by three points, polling at 51% compared to Harris's 48%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This shift in Trump's favor reflects his ability to rally voters and gain momentum, indicating that Pennsylvania remains a battleground state where Trump is making strong inroads.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Another at-lassing tell poll conducted over the same date September 20 to 25 and the same sample of 1,775 likely voters also shows Trump leading Harris by three points, with Trump polling at 51% and Harris at 48%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This consistent result underscores Trump's growing support and positions him as a serious contender in the state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Next, an Emerson College poll conducted from September 27 to 28 with a sample of 1,000 likely voters shows Harris leading Trump by one point, with both candidates polling at 49%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Although Harris is technically ahead, this poll reveals an extremely tight race where Trump's space remains strong and could tip the scales in his favor.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This result highlights Trump's continued momentum and ability to appeal to a broad cross-section of voters, keeping him highly competitive in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Finally, the last poll in the image conducted by Patriot polling from September 27 to 29 with 816 registered voters shows Trump leading Harris by one point, polling at 50% compared to Harris's 49%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This close result demonstrates that Trump is in a strong position heading into the final stretch of the campaign, with Pennsylvania shaping up to be a critical battleground.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Both candidates made campaign stops in the keystone state in recent days with Trump swinging by bucks at Lehigh counties and President Biden making a three-day push through PA with stops in Scranton, Philadelphia and in Pittsburgh.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
President Donald Trump worked at a Pennsylvania McDonald's.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And today we got to talk about president Donald Trump working a shift at a Pennsylvania McDonald's.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The optics look great, he was great.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's a billionaire, big, uh, real estate tycoon, whatever, but he's still to us, one of us.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So this was great in my humble opinion, now some people don't agree with me.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look, if Trump was to volunteer to rescue puppies, okay, puppies and kittens he's rescuing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, of course, when it comes to Kamala Harris going on cooking shows, going in restaurants, flipping burgers, I got a picture of Kamala literally flipping the burger.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Oh, she's great, and she's an amazing cook and should bring it to the white house.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, whoever that is talking, you already know it's just somebody that didn't like Trump already.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It doesn't matter what Trump did.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like I said, he could volunteer to rescue puppies and kittens and they would still try to find a way to say he did something wrong.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He could be out there picking up litter trash.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The New York times as Trump served up McDonald's fries, vitriol boiled outside.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, so talking about all you Trump supporters are being negative and violent.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Uh, Newsweek, McDonald's, Donald Trump worked at failed last health inspection.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, but I digress now what's this year: uh, MS 13 DNC, the difference between work and Trump's Trump's stage McDonald's theatrics.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There are reports suggesting Trump worked at him at Donald's, but that's not quite right because there's differences between work and stage theatrics.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump makes for our special thing in McDonald's.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's the best from Fox, now, you know, we dealing with, we talking about the mainstream media being very bad.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, now here's a Kamala let her cook.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
You see what they do.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You see what they do flipping burgers, but Hey, it's cool because you know, Kamala, that's mamala.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is locking down food network voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her love of cooking and dreams of opening a restaurant are relatable to America's foodies.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But when Trump goes in McDonald's, it's a stage photo op and everything else, right: okay.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now let's go back to the McDonald's and see Trump in action.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Thank you, i want to take a look at the Trump store.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is relatable because what do we say: okay.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's what people think that this is just a real person and he wasn't really trying to be mean or nothing like that because he gave her a compliment right afterward.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, so he comes to you from the common sense perspective and then he comes to you from the business perspective and real people can recognize that we see what's going on.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Don't be a good guy, he doesn't.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's a great guy, how many McDonald's you own, hey, you know what: i'm looking at Trump and what he has on the red tie with the white shirt and the, and the yellow, like the golden arts to this type situation.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I.P, to Dave Thomas, trump could be a new Dave Thomas.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump serving fries through the drive-thru to the reporters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, president Trump, thank you, hello everybody.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then this iconic picture of the staff leaving when Trump won hilarious.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look at Jen Psaki, all these people with Burger King hats on, okay, great, and then this person says Donald Trump gave me seven nuggets in my six piece order.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
My man coming up to see Trump in the window.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"President Trump, especially work more days at McDonald's and Kamala.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Is that what she does every day for a living, is she a burger flipper or is she a politician for the past 40 years or whatever the case may be: i mean, come on, let's start playing games.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump is set to hold a major rally with GOP candidates tomorrow night.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Back to Trump for a second, rachel, he's traveling to the state on Saturday for a rally with those top Republican candidates.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Why is he traveling to central Pennsylvania: yeah, and he'll be in Wilkes-Barre.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The most recent poll for the New York Times shows Harris is closing in on Donald Trump in a number of swing states.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's ahead in Arizona and North Carolina and narrowing his lead in Nevada and Georgia.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Trump has enlisted the help of former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard to prepare for his upcoming debate with Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Sam, Ms Gabbard, debated Harris back in 2019 during the Democratic primaries.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Is that a smart choice: in 2020, Kamala actually had to pull out before it even went there because she couldn't even make the primary.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Back to my previous point, there's such a thing as a good resignation, right: she knew when she pulled out earlier.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"When Kamala was Vice President, she got a 28% approval rate, which is lower than, I think it was Mike Pence, lower than Dick Cheney, and lower than Biden.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's got the lowest ever polling for things like that.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And then what, five minutes ago all of a sudden: even this vote was even the Vice President she polled for.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She got the lowest ever on record.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She brings joy to this.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She has this, and then they talk about the Vice President nominee, J.D. Vance, as weird, and every title is weird.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But I think Kamala is picking up a pretty big anyone but Trump vote that Joe Biden simply couldn't because people were thinking, well, one guy's a bit out there and a bit crazy and a bit offensive and a bit of a cowboy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But now that Kamala is there, everything she's done has been really well scripted.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's been really slick and polished, she hasn't had to face an election debate yet.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And on that, I mean, there's a lot of speculation that the minute she actually has to do that and debate Trump, that's when it's quite possible.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's going to have to do all the press conference, which she has refused to do.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, Trump's already spoken about it at one of his recent rallies in which he said that her proposals now for putting a tax on food and all the rest of it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's calling her comrade Kamala now because she's trying to institute communism.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yo, when I tell you this is crazy, so there was an attempt on Trump's life at the rally in Pennsylvania, right: so the gunman was unalived, you know, taken away from the scene.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So listen, just to give you some background, if you don't know anything about it and what's going on, Trump was injured at a shooting at Pennsylvania rally that left at least one person unalived.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So he injured, he critically injured two other people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He shot at Trump and I believe the teleprompter glass is what ricocheted and cut him on the air.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So Trump said on social media that he was shot and was hit by a bullet in the upper part of his right ear.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, okay, so see his one story that said that it was a teleprompter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now Trump is saying that he responded and he's saying that he was shot in the air.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Listen, I don't really, I'm not on the side of Joe Biden, not on the side of Trump either, right, to be honest with you, I understand that politics get a lot of people enraged, but I don't think anybody deserves to lose their life at all, right: so President Joe Biden spoke with Trump after the situation.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So Reince Priebus, the convention committee chair, also a former Trump administrator, chief of staff, said on a Saturday night that the event was going to, was going ahead with guests already beginning to arrive in Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So and Trump is planning to still attend per his advisors.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So those around Trump said that he has long feared the attempt on his life.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So yeah, so that happened, i also wanted to take a moment out and read the statement that Trump made on Twitter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So Donald Trump said, I want to thank the United States Secret Service and all of the law enforcement for their rapid response to the UDA that took place in Butler, Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I understand that you don't like Trump, but I seen people even making comments talking about they wish that it got done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I know that people don't like Trump, but I don't have any hatred for him at all.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is perplexed by the concept that two weeks ago he was talking about President Biden and now he's talking about Vice President Kamala Harris.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala, donald Trump then wants the crowd to know he is not cognitively impaired.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So he wants to share the story of Hannibal Lecter again here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But when I say Hannibal Lecter, they say, why does he keep mentioning it, because Hannibal Lecter was a serious psycho, right: he was the Silence of the Lands.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump says many wives would not want to be with them.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Ergo, she's tough on crime.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Play the clip, she wasn't tough on crime.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's only tough on guys like me because they want to go after their political opponents.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Then Donald Trump says he doesn't know much about shootings or, you know, he says people like him when it comes to the Second Amendment, but he doesn't know a lot about that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But what he does know about his golf, he says, play the clip.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He said that's like sinking a two-foot putt, dad.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That would be the equivalent, is that right: he actually said it might be less than that because some people can't sink a two-foot putt like Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's a great guy, great young athlete.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So all these things and, you know, then you figure what are the odds that that happened, right: he then calls Vice President Kamala Harris a new fighter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala is the new fighter.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Who cares: he then accuses Vice President Kamala Harris of inventing a Southern accent in Atlanta, Georgia.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Play the clip, in her speech in Atlanta last night, Kamala Harris even tried to outbrand a new Southern accent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He then calls the leader of the Senate, Democrat Chuck Schumer, a Palestinian and someone who's with Hamas.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's how Donald Trump labels Chuck Schumer.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Pretty pathetic stuff there, then Donald Trump just rambles on about telling rich people that made some he doesn't like, that they want him to take over telephone companies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He then says the reason that he loses is because Democrats cheat, play the clip.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He then asks the crowd if they like red meat.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, he then lies about crowd sizes in speeches that he gave many months ago.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He lies about the size of the crowd size in New Jersey.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He says it's like 107,000 people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He lies about the crowd sizes in the Bronx.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then Donald Trump praises the crowd size on January 6th.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's horrible, it's insurrection.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, trump then talks about how he's been accused of throwing hamburgers on the wall.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's all there publicly, but Donald Trump's gonna, Donald Trump, meaning he's just gonna go out there and lie.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He then attacks President Biden for calling Pennsylvania a state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then Donald Trump shortly thereafter calls Pennsylvania a state instead of a commonwealth.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He would call it a state often.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Then throughout the speech, Donald Trump was praising his lawyer or spokesperson, Alina Habba.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And this is par for the course for Alina Habba and Trump surrogates.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And this is the first time that I've ever seen a Trump surrogates.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Donald Trump, if you look at the Venn diagram, is both a rapist and a fraudster.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
One of Donald Trump's top surrogates also posted the following.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump's top surrogate, Laura Loomer, says, ""'Donald Trump lifted the ban on blacks and Jews ""'coming to country clubs in Palm Beach, Florida. ""'",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He also has a Fulton County mugshot, ""'his own sneaker line and three baby mamas. ""'",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is blacker than Kamala Harris will ever be.'""",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Go and vote, former President Donald Trump at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks last night for a town hall, he took questions from the crowd for about 90 minutes with South Carolina's Senator Kristi Noem serving as moderator.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Trump campaign estimated 5 to 6000 people were here for this event.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump stopped taking questions during those times requesting Ave Maria be played the first time an instrumental version came on.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And during the second emergency, Trump specified he actually meant Pavarotti's version, so that came on.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She rallied voters in Erie, telling the crowd the region is one of the most influential in presidential elections with the vote in Erie County, often predicting the national result.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris also touched on some hot topics of this year's race like abortion.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris will return to the Keystone state tomorrow for a campaign event in Philadelphia.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
There's polling that showed today Kamala Harris up by a point.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This is a tough state to compete in and win in, the good news is what Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are doing is showing up in the communities that need to meet them, the communities that are oftentimes ignored or left behind.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, right before they went to the DNC in Chicago, they weren't in Philly or Pittsburgh.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They're showing up in the communities that need to hear from them, need to understand, you know, what they're all about, kind of kick the tires and understand more.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I want to just get your reaction to something that Donald Trump says a lot about Jewish Americans.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look, I think it is more of the same from Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I have been the recipient of many attacks from Donald Trump, including anti-Semitic attacks from Donald Trump over the years, as have the people of Pennsylvania and the American people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is someone who peddles bigotry and hatred.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He constantly tries to create others in our society, separate people out based on what they look like, where they come from, who they love, who they pray to, and it is something that is deeply offensive, I think, to many people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When you look at what Donald Trump has specifically said to American Jews, this notion of this dual loyalty where American Jews can only care about Israel, that is deeply offensive to me and to many others.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He has failed the test as commander in chief before.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And one of the things you had to do was go into court and basically preserve the kind of integrity of the state's election system underneath the sort of fuselage of lawsuits from the Trump campaign and others.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Are you confident about the election infrastructure in your state, about the sort of these kind of county-level canvassing boards, any kind of mischief that folks in the Trump campaign might get up to to get people to not do what is essentially their legal duty to count certified votes: yeah, in 2020 here in Pennsylvania, we had a free and fair, safe and secure election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Turning now to the US campaign trail, Vice President Kamala Harris takes an indirect jab at her Republican rival Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"During a campaign stop in Pennsylvania, Harris suggested Trump as a coward, whose politics focused on putting down rivals.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Opinion polls have shown Harris bringing fresh energy to the Democratic campaign and closing the gap with former President Trump both nationally and in many battleground states.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"During a rally in Flint, Harris highlighted her plans for what she called an opportunity economy and vowed to put middle-class working families first.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"During the town hall with voters, Trump spoke about the economy criticizing Harris's policies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"On Saturday, Trump will hold a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, returning to the site of that first assassination attempt back in July.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So Caitlin, why did the Trump campaign want to return to the scene of that deadly assassination attempt: well, Lana, this has been in the works for a while now, the Trump campaign wanting the former president to return to the scene of the crime, essentially, to show defiance in this campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And it's hard to kind of overstate how seminal a moment this was, that first assassination attempt, not only in American politics, but specifically when it comes to Trump and his supporters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I want to get a little bit more of a sense of Harris's message for Michigan voters because we know that both Harris and Trump have spent a lot of time there in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, so Kamala Harris, when she's here in Michigan, she's really hammering home the fact that it was the Biden-Harris administration that passed this massive inflation reduction act, which contains billions of dollars worth of grants and subsidies and credits and incentives for green energy and especially important here in Michigan for green vehicles, incentives to buy them, but more importantly here in Michigan, incentives to build them, incentives to convert factories into electric vehicle factories.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He said, well, we've got to look at everything.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, that's good, here's Harris answering questions to the press and this is a market change.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But here is Harris with a decidedly different rhetorical approach to this age old question that we get from the Beltway Press.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But to see Harris basically, I'm not going to take the bait.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Would be an interesting dynamic, would you rather have a 51 or 52 seat majority with cinema and mansion or a 50 seat majority with none of those with like maybe tester being the most conservative for Harris: it sort of depends on like, you know, there was like back in the in the days where like Joe Lieberman was around and, you know, Evan Bayh.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What we saw was a small Harris lead, but within the margin of error becoming a race that is way, way, way too close to call at this particular point.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Look at that with exactly 270 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 268, alright, so Kamala Harris wins the electoral college when she wins the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump wins in the electoral college, 287 electoral votes to Kamala Harris's 251 electoral votes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And the bottom line is, if Kamala Harris loses in the state of Pennsylvania, and that is the tipping point state, as Mr. Berman put it, the state that put Donald Trump over the top in the electoral college, there are gonna be some real questions as to whether Kamala Harris should have chosen Josh Shapiro given how popular he is in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Could she have been a winner if she had chosen him instead of Tim Walts: we don't know the answer to that question.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The Harris campaign has added an issues tab on the campaign website, but I wonder what you think about this perception from voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, first of all, I think we basically know what a Kamala Harris presidency would focus on because there is kind of a communal bottom-up agenda from the Democratic Party really at all levels.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
We have four years of Biden and can compare that to four years of Trump and voters can render their judgment based on that.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Polling in recent days shows Trump is ahead in every swing state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And there's also been some analysis on the swing states that are the most ethnically diverse are the ones more likely to favor Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, and Trump even giving a visiting Detroit, a majority black city, somewhat a city that's been majority black for about a century and also doing things like holding rallies in the Bronx.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump will be the next president.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if you look, Trump is close in Michigan and it's close in Pennsylvania, but he's farther ahead in other swing states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's ahead comfortably there, so a lot can happen and a lot can be wrong with polls.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Christian, talk to us about what the world might look like if Trump is successful.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, it's on fire during the Biden administration, but Trump says he'll fix Ukraine.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He'll do something different in the Middle East.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What will the world look like foreign policy wise if he gets up: right.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he has the benefit of being a challenger where you don't actually have to go into intricate detail.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump gave, I think, the benefit of the doubt to China.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You may recall in his first year in office, he had a summit at Mar-a-Lago.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He gave a mini trade deal to China, but then China inflicted the coronavirus on the world and has not accounted for that or come clean about its origins.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So I think you'd see a second Trump term without as much chaos and without as much groping for what America first policy really means.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Robert O'Brien, who was the final national security of the four that Trump had, I would say he was the only good one, wrote something recently in Foreign Affairs, an establishment magazine here, but saying basically it would be a return to Ronald Reagan style peace through strength, meaning we don't go abroad looking to do nation building.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Trump does want to negotiate with Russia, which for some reason is controversial here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"First up, let's talk about Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's been hitting the ground hard, especially focusing on black men voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris has been outlining her opportunity agenda, which includes key issues like abortion rights.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's really emphasizing how critical this issue is, aiming to sway voters who might be on the fence.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris even took a jab at Trump, criticizing him for downplaying the significance of abortion rights.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But Trump is not backing down, he's been holding a town hall near Philadelphia, rallying his base in this crucial state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is as fiery as ever, focusing on his core supporters and trying to lock in those votes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris is pushing hard on this front, but she's facing some challenges too.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Specifically, she's having a tough time garnering support from Muslim and Arab leaders due to concerns over U.S. policies in the Middle East.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Former President Bill Clinton is supporting Harris in Georgia, while Senator Bob Casey is targeting GOP challenger Dave McCormick's residency in a new advertisement.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So what's the takeaway here: both Harris and Trump are putting Pennsylvania in the spotlight, knowing that the state's voters could very well decide the outcome of the election.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Added Chapter Harris is also focusing on economic policies, aiming to boost job creation and support small businesses.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She believes that by strengthening the economy, she can win over undecided voters who are concerned about their financial future.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Additionally, Harris is making a strong push to connect with younger voters, emphasizing the importance of education and student loan forgiveness.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She knows that the youth vote can be a game changer in this election.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"On the other hand, Trump is doubling down on his promise to bring back manufacturing jobs to Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's focusing on trade policies that he claims will benefit American workers and revitalize the industrial sector.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is also making a concerted effort to appeal to veterans, promising better health care and support for those who have served.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
His campaign is highlighting his past efforts to improve the VA and his commitment to the military community.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Whether you're a Harris supporter or a Trump backer, make sure your voice is heard.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And we know Trump is about, look, he's a great here going through this, he's doing it because he l and I love the fact that h that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Rain or shine, they showed up for President Trump tonight in Western Pennsylvania and it was pouring rain.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
President Trump wants to give a boost to another primary candidate.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's endorsed Dr. Mehmet Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You know him as Dr. Oz from TV.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's running for Senate in Pennsylvania and hopes to ride that Trump wave to victory on May 17th, just as J.D. Vance did in Ohio this past Tuesday.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's from his campaign website you can see.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But the question, are these candidates truly on board with the MAGA agenda or just looking to get Trump's seal of approval and the spoils that come with it: nyle Scanage, White House columnist at The Hill, among a number of other titles at our sister publication.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look, you've got to give Trump credit, right: ohio, Pennsylvania, same kind of workers.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, clearly, as you say, there was a very tangible effect from Trump's endorsement of J.D. Vance in Ohio, when it comes to Pennsylvania, yes, there are certainly some questions from more ideological conservatives about some of Mehmet Oz's past positions on issues like gun control and abortion.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Off the record, how many Republicans that you talk about worry that tying yourself to Trump in 2022 will allow Democrats to run against Trump, even though he's not on the ballot: i think it's a great question, and that concern is definitely out there.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We were just talking about Trump's value in a Republican primary with the broader electorate.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, no, the general always makes it more difficult, interestingly enough, one of the reasons that Trump says he endorsed Oz, even though, as you point out, he's probably to use a MAGA word squishy on a couple of their issues, transgender issues being among them, is he thinks that Oz will do better in a general election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's GOP approval in Pennsylvania, 77 percent, how long is Trump's endorsement good for, and I guess the answer is till it's not, right: yes, that is the answer.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There have been various predictions made at times by people in my business, as well as by Trump critics in the Republican Party, suggesting that his influence is about to wane, his grip is about to loosen, that traditional or establishment Republicans are about to make a comeback.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What we're seeing in a lot of these primaries is a test of how far the simple backing of Donald Trump will carry you, whatever your past record happens to be.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, and so much of that, at least for Trump and Trump supporters, depending on the state, is how much you'll buy into the 2020 was rigged and President Trump actually won and it was stolen from him, something that Democrats just love getting Republican primary candidates to say so they can run against it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The flip side of sort of the view President Trump delivered on the stump today, Pennsylvania, is President Biden in Ohio.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now with three weeks to go until the US presidential election, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have held rival campaign events in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Ms Harris announced a plan to give black men more economic opportunities and described some of her opponents' behaviour as increasingly unhinged.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now his remarks were twice interrupted by medical emergencies in the crowd.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She sort of stepped up.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's always sort of, for months she has been arguing that former President Trump is unfit.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She also unveiled a new ad that features some of his former national security aides basically saying that.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Clearly her campaign is trying to shake stuff up because, you know, I mean, this has been a crazy couple of months and an unprecedented couple of months in terms of American politics.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She had a really sort of burst of momentum, you know, through her coalescing that support through the DNC, the Democratic National Convention, where she officially took officially became the nominee through the debate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So in addition to sort of becoming more aggressive in her messaging about the former president, you see her doing media interviews all over the place, traditional stuff like 60 Minutes, but also non-traditional podcasts and radio shows.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, she's clearly trying to do something to shake the race up.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And now that she has Governor Tim Walsom in the ticket, we have yet to see any Pennsylvania polls yet, but I do imagine that will offer a bump to Kamala Harris, even if marginal, any bump will help her, given that now in the most recent polls, she's either leading or tied in this state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I also believe that to be true, my video this morning I said, I believe Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will win this state by one to two points, but right now, a four point margin isn't far out from where it's closer to be.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But looking at the general election matchup, Kamala Harris now takes the lead.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's been leading in the five way for a little bit period of time.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's up 0.6% of the five way.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Practically every recent poll here, besides Harvard Harris and Russ Musken, show Kamala Harris leading.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You could also see in the two way race, practically every recent poll shows Kamala Harris leading.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so the 0.5% advantage here, while not certainly as impressive as Biden's plus six points in 2020, Hillary Clinton's even seven point advantage after the convention, we are finding that Kamala Harris is rebounding, especially relative to Biden, who again, when he dropped out, was down three points nationally.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so I think Kamala Harris really narrowing down this state too, also has now been translated to some of the political betting market odds.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now Donald Trump stands at the lowest point he has been in this entire past three months.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But so Kamala Harris is now rising, rising, rising, whereas she also rising is the state of Pennsylvania relative to where President Biden was.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But what we know, based on data points, even before she announced Tim Wallace as the VP, and I do think he adds a lot, especially being from the Midwest, an election winner of 2020 and 2022 rather in 2018, he does well in the state, is that Pennsylvania, right now I have as a lean Democratic state, I do believe Kamala Harris and Tim Wallace can win it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Even the Emerson poll, we can see here, has Trump up by two, which was a very good poll for Trump just right after the announcement.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The poll taken right before the announcement had Trump up by five.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I think that's exactly what these polls are revealing, that the true margin right now is somewhere around Kamala Harris being up by one to two points in the state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, against Biden, Trump led by 2.9%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In Nevada, Donald Trump leads Kamala Harris by four points, but that's including a poll that was inside her advantage that was taken earlier on before she was announced as the nominee.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The only poll after she became the nominee has her up by two.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris make major improvements relative to President Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She has the opportunity to take this VP selection, which Democrats, Republicans alike seem to really like him.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"We found out that under the Donald Trump administration, Tim Walz was actually appointed to this round table of governors who advised the president.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This complacency in our complicity, complacency, this election cycle has been all about Donald Trump maintaining and building momentum.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When he was up against Biden, the first real thing that we saw was that in the most, in the time where the Democratic Party needed to unify the most, they were not unified because many members of Congress, senators, governors had concerns about President Biden's viability.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"A month and a half ago, Kamala Harris was not the presidential nominee.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Because as I have been saying for months now, Donald Trump was never hitting 50% in battleground state polls.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But Kamala Harris as the opposition to Joe Biden, not opposition, but the alternative to Joe Biden does far better.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And that helped Trump because his enthusiasm numbers were through the roof compared to Biden.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now coming to an abrupt halt because Joe Biden dropped out of the race, Donald Trump Republicans must be really angry because this is a very difficult position for them to navigate.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They spent an entire convention railing against President Biden only for the day after the convention ends for Joe Biden to drop out of the race.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, 22 days to go until Election Day, and the stock market hit another record high day, with the Dow closing above 43,000 for the first time in history, something Donald Trump said could never happen with Joe Biden in the White House.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Tonight, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump both held campaign events in Pennsylvania, in Erie, Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her seventh visit to the western part of the state, Kamala Harris, used Donald Trump's own words to prosecute him.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"After all these years, we know who Donald Trump is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I've said for a while now, watch his rallies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Listen to his words, he tells us who he is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So you heard his words.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump, donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He has worked to prevent women from making their own health care decisions and threaten your fundamental freedoms and rights like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Vice President Harris is being more aggressive in questioning 78 year old Donald Trump's mental fitness for president for another four years.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Over the weekend, Kamala Harris released a summary of her medical records revealing that she is quote, in excellent health and adding quote, she possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency to include those as chief executive head of state and commander in chief.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In North Carolina yesterday, Kamala Harris said this.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's not being transparent with the voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's not being transparent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So check this out, he refuses to release his medical records.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He is unwilling to do a 60 minutes interview.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He is unwilling to meet for a second debate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The Journal's survey asked economists how Trump's proposed broad-based tariffs would affect domestic manufacturing employment of the 44 economists who responded.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In an interview today, Vice President Harris said this.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump heard and was like, He is, and Biden was like, I am: speaking of Trump, I read that he's holding a big fundraiser in Palm Beach that I expected to raise $43 million for his campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yep, for an $800,000 donation, you get to sit at Trump's table.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And yet, when Donald Trump lies or cheats or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls POWs losers or fellow citizens vermin.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I love this, they be getting juicy though.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"President Biden and Vice President Harris were down there meeting with local officials and comforting families, asking how they could help.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And yet, when Donald Trump lies or cheats or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls POWs losers or fellow citizens vermin, people make excuses for it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I've noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior of bullying and of putting people down is a sign of strength.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It never has been, said, cut him in.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris spent her day in the Southwest campaigning in Arizona and Nevada.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's continuing her recent media blitz with a Univision town hall.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Trump traveled to Michigan.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He spoke at the Detroit Economic Club laying out his agenda.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And there is a concern privately among some Democrats that Vice President Harris, her support among some some union members could be a little bit soft.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Bob, I want to switch gears and talk about Florida Governor Ron DeSantis there is accusing Kamala Harris of playing a political game with the hurricane disaster response.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He said that she never called or came to visit after any other hurricanes in the last three and a half years.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Vice President Harris and her team say she is fully engaged as well.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"During a campaign stop at Erie, Harris slammed Trump for his ominous comments about the enemy within the United States and threat to deploy the military domestically.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump, I think in our collective opinion, certainly mine, is an unserious man.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged and he is out for unchecked power.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's what he's looking for, and Donald Trump also hit the trail in the state with a town hall outside Philadelphia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Earlier in an interview, Trump discussed his concerns about the upcoming election day and his potential second term from dismissed Biden's awareness and emphasized that the real threat comes from within the country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He doesn't hold the administration, so he has no power to deploy national guard or the US military, but giving out such threats.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For example, if you look at what Kamala announced as a policy decision about doling out shops, about the one million unforgiven, small loans of twenty thousand dollars to the undeserved communities, she's trying to look at black men because the votes of the black men, because polls suggest that black men are drifting away from the Democrats.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In the final weeks leading up to election day, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are making their final pitches to voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Today, Trump is participating in multiple town hall events while Harris returns to Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris continued her campaign blitz, focusing on black male voters, with an interview on the radio show, The Breakfast Club.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Meantime at a Bloomberg town hall yesterday, Trump falsely claimed there was a peaceful transfer of power back in 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You're looking at Nydia Cavazos in Detroit, following the Harris campaign on the left.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And Jake Rosen here with me in Studio 57 with the latest on the Trump campaign, nydia, let's start with you, Harris back in Pennsylvania today.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Her 11th trip, I understand, to the state since launching her campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Who specifically, which demographic is she trying to win over there: good morning, Earl.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And this is as she tries to court Republican voters from moderate Republicans to Republicans who have turned against former President Donald Trump.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And we're not necessarily favoring his policies or his personality per se.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And all of this is part of the Harris's campaign's efforts to do outreach to these communities, especially in suburban areas.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So for Harris and her campaign, the focus here is to not only ensure that her base is going to turn out and vote and have strengthened this voter turnout, but also ensure that they're making inroads with Republicans or moderate Republicans so that she can gain support here and further her chances of swinging several battleground states in her favor.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And based on these NBC reports, you can see that while there is a shortcoming in terms of finance that the Trump campaign has raised versus the Harris campaign, there is this massive millionaire, billionaire swell that we've seen over the last couple months to close that gap.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Is there a difference in approach from the Trump campaign versus the Harris campaign when trying to get this block: well, the Trump campaign feels really good about where they stand with Latino voters only needing to peel back some in states like Florida, where this is being taped, but also Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, same as what we saw yesterday with the Fox News Town Hall with women in Georgia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Just like Eddie said, trying to peel around those margins, women in a state that Trump needs to win, a group that Donald Trump is not doing well in, and a group that needs to improve in the home stretch.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris is riding a big wave of momentum to the Democratic DNC there.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's no longer the case, right, so what will President Trump be doing during the DNC: yeah, so early on, it looks like he's going to be focusing on Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He is in Wilkes-Barre today and then York, Pennsylvania on Monday at the start of the DNC in Chicago.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He won in 2016, narrowly lost in 2020, looking at some polling that came out this week from Quinnipiac University, looking at likely voters in Pennsylvania, Harris is up by three points, so there's some work for him to do there, Gio.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Jay, Harris is getting some good polling this morning in the Sunbelt states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The three states to keep an eye on out of this are North Carolina, where Harris has a narrow lead over Trump by about two points, and then, of course, Arizona, where Harris is up by five, that New York Times-Ciena College poll shows, and then Nevada, where it's got Trump up by a few points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And Perry, Trump has been taking some heat, of course, for comments that he made this week about the Presidential Medal of Freedom.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let's go ahead and take a listen to this, the highest award you can get is a civilian.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now, Perry, the Trump campaign is defending those remarks.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But as Trump has said, he is who he is, and this is how he's going to be talking to voters, Gio.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania

"Telegraph, Kamala Harris is set to face significant protests from pro-Palestine demonstrators at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, with police preparing for potential chaos reminiscent of the 1968 Vietnam War protests.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Despite this, Harris has reasons to celebrate, as new polls show her leading Donald Trump in several swing states, suggesting a potential new electoral path through the Sun Belt states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her popularity among younger, liberal voters, women, Latinos, and black Americans contrasts with Biden's previous struggles, the convention will likely highlight tensions between Harris and pro-Palestine activists, reflecting her more critical stance on Israel's actions in Gaza.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The police are preparing to manage the protests with strategies aimed at preventing violence, while Trump has condemned such demonstrations and hinted at a military response if elected.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yahoo U.S., Michael Moore, the outspoken filmmaker known for Fahrenheit 9-11, is optimistic about Kamala Harris's chances in an upcoming debate against Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania

"Harris aims to secure support in urban areas with large black populations, while Trump focuses on white, non-college-educated voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The Harris campaign's early ad reservations allow them to lock in lower rates, ensuring a robust media presence as the election approaches.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris leads former President Donald Trump in Arizona and North Carolina, while trailing narrowly in Nevada.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This shift comes as Harris steps into the role of presumptive Democratic nominee, revitalizing the party's chances in these critical battlegrounds.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The polls indicate that Harris has strong support among young voters, black voters, and women, which could be pivotal in securing victories in these states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"As the Democratic National Convention approaches, Harris's upcoming speech is anticipated to further boost her campaign, setting the stage for a crucial period leading up to the presidential debate and the start of early voting.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The illustration reflects the confidence within Kamala Harris's party as they navigate the political landscape.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"With the Democratic National Convention on the horizon, Harris's anticipated speech is expected to solidify her position and energize the base.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"According to New York Times' Siena College polls conducted from August 8 to 15, Harris and Trump each garnered an average of 48 percent support among likely voters across these states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Notably, Harris leads Trump in Arizona and North Carolina, while the two are nearly tied in Nevada.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This marks a substantial shift from previous polling in May, where Trump had a nearly 10-point lead over President Biden in some of these states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris has energized Democratic voters, with 65 percent expressing at least some enthusiasm about voting for her, compared to 68 percent of Trump supporters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She is also leading among key demographic groups, including women, young voters, and independents.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris enjoys robust support from black and Hispanic voters, demographics Trump had previously tried to court.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"While Trump maintains an edge on issues like immigration and the economy, Harris has a significant advantage on abortion, a topic she has championed since the 2022 midterms.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Despite being in what the Trump campaign calls a honeymoon period, Harris' momentum is influencing down-ballot races, benefiting Democratic candidates in Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Trump campaign has questioned the accuracy of these polls, noting discrepancies in self-reported voting behavior from 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Harris's possible VP picks are also making their best case to be her running mate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
New polling from Emerson College shows Harris neck and neck with Trump in those swing states.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump inching slightly ahead, harris is being pulled in several different directions when choosing her VP pick.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He has battled Trump directly, which fits with Harris's campaign message, painting Trump as a fella.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But some of his policy stances could bring ire from within the party.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It was that last comment there from that Trump voter that has rung out a few times from other Trump voters here, even though they've said they're going to vote for Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"John Delano, politics editor with CBS News Pittsburgh, spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris about the top issues for the Keystone State voters, including her stance on the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by the Japanese company Nippon Steel.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But both former President Trump and Vice President Harris are saying the same thing, along with President Biden on this issue.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But you still find a lot of people who may not be viewing these ads and these promotions saying, what are her policies: now, it's kind of weird because we don't really know what Trump's policies are.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So that's interesting, John, so the ads are what we would call softer ads, which is to say introducing the vice president, introducing her policies, not necessarily beating up on her opponent or making some other point.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He's for the billionaires.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's trying to make the contrast.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And in the course of doing that, she's citing her various programs with respect to housing and the notion of first time mortgages.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So you get a feeling that she stands for something.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And they're taking in from the Trump campaign and how that's being received by the voters you're talking to.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, I really think the people that are supporting Donald Trump had been with Donald Trump throughout.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You go to certain parts of Western Pennsylvania, his signs are up and there are very few Harris signs.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You go to other parts and the Harris signs are up.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There are 50, at least 50 local offices for the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The Trump campaign tells me they have about two dozen in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They don't feel they need them.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"They have a different strategy for winning, which is basically to bring out the voters who voted for Donald Trump before, particularly in 2016.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if they're five percent, obviously that can make a difference in a state where the last two presidential racists came to a point or less.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Which means he can win the election if he just gets the state of Pennsylvania, which is 19 electoral votes, which is the most electoral votes out of any swing state in the entire country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And now Donald Trump has a lead.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There really is no in between, and what we do know is that Donald Trump leads in these two counties by 1%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when you talk about that white working class vote, Harris just dropping, you know, two, three points, you know, Trump making up some ground just because Joe Biden was a better fit for those voters than somebody like a Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump is going to gain significantly out of the gate.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, it's true that with these white college graduate voters, Harris may make some gains by how much we could, you know, question that.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But still, it's very likely that Harris, she probably loses, you know, a little bit of ground with black voters, according to most polling.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It's very likely that the polls are overestimating Trump's support.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, you know, you could adjust for the turnout, but just doing that would give Donald Trump the victory.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The Trump base is fired up.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But when you look at the counties and you see, oh, Trump is up by, you know, one to two points in these counties, Donald Trump usually is winning the state of Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, I think he could very well be up by a little bit more and it doesn't take into account potential swings in places like Philadelphia City proper, where it's the largest county in the state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And you will probably see a decent swing to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So these counties may not even be direct bellwethers, but the fact that Donald Trump is, you know, starting to turn a little bit of a corner in these bellwether counties, that's good news for him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That really is, and it's possible the polls underestimating him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Obviously, Trump did better than, you know, Mitt Romney significantly in those areas.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now it's a tie sometimes, depending on the day, Trump has a narrow lead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's with polls typically underestimating Donald Trump significantly in the state of Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Campaign focus and strata, Harris has been making numerous trips to Pennsylvania, emphasizing a broader strategy that goes beyond traditional Democratic strongholds.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She has visited smaller cities like Johnstown, Wilkes-Barre and Pittsburgh, which are in areas that were once reliably Democratic but flipped to Trump in 2016.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Rural and exurban areas, the Harris campaign is particularly focused on rural and exurban areas, where Trump has strong support.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris has expanded her campaign efforts into these regions, including Beaver County, Lancaster County and Fayette County, to connect with voters who may not be as familiar with her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This targeted advertising aims to enhance Harris' personal narrative and economic policies.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Grunlike in 2020, when the pandemic limited campaign activities, the Harris campaign has been able to enhance its ground efforts.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"With 350 staffers and 36 campaign offices across the state, including many in rural or Republican areas, Harris is engaging with voters more directly.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This includes visits to local businesses and community events, such as her unannounced stop at a cafe and bookstore in Johnstown.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Debate and public engagement, Harris prepared for the first presidential debate in Pittsburgh and has since engaged in various interviews and rallies across the state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She emphasized the importance of listening to voters and earning every vote, particularly in areas that are not traditionally Democratic strongholds.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Economic and policy messaging, the campaign is highlighting Harris' plans to lower prescription drug costs, restore abortion rights and prevent chaos in the White House.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"These messages are tailored to appeal to a broad range of voters, including those in rural areas who may have supported Trump in the past.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump campaign comparison, trump's campaign is also heavily focused on Pennsylvania, criticizing Harris on economic issues and trying to shape her image among voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, the Harris campaign believes its organization is stronger, with a broader reach into rural and swing counties.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Polling and voter sentiment, recent polls show Harris leading Trump by a slim margin in Pennsylvania, with the economy being a top issue for voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Despite Trump's edge on economic issues, Harris is seen as having strong moral character and mental sharpness, which could sway undecided voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Republicans for Harris, in a unique strategy, the Harris campaign is using Republican voices to court rural GOP voters.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This includes radio ads featuring former Trump supporters who now plan to vote for Harris, aimed at blunting Trump's margins in swing or red counties.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Also, even if he can get to the House, the Senate probably not going to love this either.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So, Akhila, an interesting dynamic here for President Trump, he was in the New York courthouse yesterday.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's going back today.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's going to be there a lot in recent weeks.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The president himself has made clear he doesn't want to talk about Trump's legal issues.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He wants to keep a line between the White House and any matter with the Department of Justice or any local jurisdiction.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think that's partly because Trump has tried to paint this as a politically motivated attack against them.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And yet Trump has really not been able to catch up when it comes to that ground game.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And it does feel like a bit of a pivotal moment here as we're finally seeing Trump tied to a courtroom day after day.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Vice President Harris has focused her campaign today on Pennsylvania, which is not much of a surprise, but her strategy is worth looking at.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's trying to convince voters in areas where Donald Trump's pretty popular to vote for her, at least cut into his margins.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And this one has been getting more and more red, but Trump did better in 16 than he did in 20.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But by the way, first, I want to talk to you about why Harris is there.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Anyway, Harris is going there today.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So what's at stake there, Luzerne County, for Harris and Trump: yeah.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And as you mentioned, Connell, rightly, that these are counties that Trump won in 2020 and 2016, both of them, but have previously gone for Obama, I believe Cambria County, in 2008.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's Trump sign.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Next door, you could see Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
You see all the Trump signs.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is making clear that she gets how to win Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The week before the DNC, she came to Pennsylvania and she didn't go to Philly or Pittsburgh.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She went to a county you've probably never heard of, Beaver County, in the southwestern corner of our state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And there she came to talk about cutting costs.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She came to talk about economic challenges and what a Harris administration would do to improve their lives.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That tells me that she understands, yeah, it's going to be hard to get that last yard and a half, but she's doing the right things to be able to do that.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And I'm really optimistic, i think Kamala Harris has the momentum and is moving in the right direction and showing signs that she clearly understands how to campaign in our Commonwealth.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
One thing that that brings to mind is the fact that Kamala Harris and Tim will also are opening up field offices across the state.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Way more, and so if you contrast that to what Donald Trump has opened up in PA, where I think it was just less than where you can count on one hand, where is all the money going in the Trump campaign, and can you talk about the fact that we are seeing such a disparity in the actual ground game between the two campaigns: look, I don't know what the hell Donald Trump's doing with his money.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's got some intensity behind his campaign.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And you're seeing more and more enthusiasm and you see it show up at these neighborhood offices that Kamala Harris has put in place where they're showing up not just to take a shift, but also showing up and saying, hey, listen, I'm not a registered Democrat, but I still want to be part of this campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There's a meaningful enthusiasm out there for her, and I think one quote that kind of puts that on full display, I believe it was Jeff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia at the DNC, who said voting for Kamala Harris doesn't make you a Democrat.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That guy goes out and parrots Trump's bullshit every day.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And it's clear Donald Trump is having a whole lot of buyer's remorse.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, i mean, this is somebody who, for example, is, uh, is running on the ticket with somebody who he called America's Hitler.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They had different healthcare policy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, he's not being honest with us.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's not being honest with himself.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's a total poser.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But what I try and do, what I know Kamala Harris and others try and do is go out and also earn the support of the individuals in that organization.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And the shtick is getting old, look, it's getting old when firefighters booed JD Vance, when a whole lot of folks realize the empty promises Donald Trump made back in 2015, 2016 never followed through on during his four years in the White House.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Just recently, Donald Trump has come out and said that he's actually going to be a champion for IVF and he's actually expressed hostility toward the six-week abortion ban that his own policies facilitated.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What does it say about the state of this race that this is the tack that he's taking now: well, look, it's clearly where the vast majority of Americans are.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Remember, it was he who packed the Supreme Court so that they would overturn Roe v. Wade and it was he who ran to the microphones to claim credit for it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's what he's doing here, and let's finish off with this, and I'm not sure how this question got here, but are you enjoying your momentary rain as the best team in the NFC East while the Giants regain their footing: the birds are back, baby.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You're watching Harris is outreach specifically to Latino voters with what is really the strategy here and why is that voter base so crucial, especially this time around: read we're here in Doran, Florida.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And as we've seen in polling, Trump still is doing better than Harris and some polls when it comes to the economy and the majority of polls.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And most polling down here in Miami-Dade County shows that Latinos are choosing Trump over Harris, which is why the Harris campaign has been trying to get out this message to Latino voters, sort of reminding them in a way about the immigration policies that former President Trump had, but also trying to get the message of what they would do when it comes to the economy, which is a key issue for this voting work.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris on the stage with 100 Republicans, what's that all about: well, look, she is holding an event in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So the Harris campaign at this point is on the defensive in a way, trying to get some of those crossover voters, perhaps, you know, she's going to be on stage with about 100 Republicans who are saying that they're going to vote for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So at this point what she is looking to do is get that crossover appeal to some Republicans or some moderate, some people who may be on the fence, some moderate Republicans, folks that may be on the fence, about what is it that could potentially give them an appeal to Kamala Harris, what could potentially get them over to her side.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's what her focus is on right now.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Obviously, as you know, the race in Pennsylvania raised her thin.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's going to need some moderate Republicans, some crossover voters in order to be able to win that key state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If he wins the presidential race in November, Biden and Trump's stance on the proposed deal coming as the two candidates face the heat of election year politics.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's no secret about that, and I think any politician would be crazy to dismiss the fact that Trump won in 2016, because for one reason he won anyway, was he appealed to those blue collar workers in Midwestern states who feel like their way of life has been eroding and nobody has been doing anything about it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Again, Trump's trying to show some solidarity with union workers.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, does that mean he's for sure gonna win the state by 15 points: no, but when you look at the current state of the race in Pennsylvania, Trump's in a very good position to flip Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if Trump's in a good position here, for starters, he's probably up in other swing states, but he's probably gonna win the presidency if he's winning Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So for Trump to be in a good position to win Pennsylvania, it bodes very well from the win the presidency.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's not like it's, you know, Nevada that's worth only six electoral votes where, yeah, Trump could win it, but even then it would not be enough to win the presidency.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So for Trump to be up here, yeah, it's a big freaking deal.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he wins Pennsylvania by two to three points, for starters, he's not just barely winning the electoral college.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"At that point, he's winning states like Wisconsin, Michigan.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's up in Arizona.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's probably winning Nevada.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So so if he's up by two to three points in Pennsylvania, he is easily winning.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There's no way he wins Pennsylvania by two to three.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But by some miracle, he loses Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But if Trump's up by two to three in Pennsylvania, more than likely, he's going to win the other swing states, especially in the Rust Belt.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So even then, he doesn't even need a state like Nevada, Arizona.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Hell, he doesn't even need Georgia at that point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he's really winning Pennsylvania by two to three points, which, by the way, he's up in Arizona, Georgia, but we'll just say he doesn't win either of those states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, if he is winning Pennsylvania by two to three points, he's winning Wisconsin and Michigan.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's why it's a big deal that he's tied to the RCP average, which is a tie because screw Bloomberg for having this garbage Harris plus five.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's a tied race, but the problem for Harris is those undecided voters, they lean heavily towards Trump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So the fact that Harris has at best a very small lead in Pennsylvania, the fact is those undecideds, they're going to break for Trump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Surely there's other metrics out there that show Harris having a victory.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In my opinion, I think the Trump campaign, they should talk more about this.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, the stuff that Harris said about the Knights of Columbus, for example, it is real bad.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The fact is that she said that crap about the Knights of Columbus is unbelievable.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But but the point is she she has no appeal to Catholic voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But the fact is, if she's doing this bad with Catholics in Notre Dame, what do you think is happening everywhere else: we just got to see what happens.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But if it's even just a 10 point shift towards Trump, he's got Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's got states like Wisconsin locked down.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All the better, so good for walls, and good for Harris again, because like I sometimes I get a little, you know, I think we highlight walls because he's a wonderful communicator and like does a lot of the things that we wanted for the Democrats to do.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But sometimes I think he gets a little outsized attention because, you know, he's like the white guy that like a lot of people whatever think is a communicator of the issues that I don't know.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He is better at that stuff.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But you picked him for a reason and then like, well, but that's the point.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, he's actually, you know, like we have seen.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And and so he is extremely concrete in terms of and she by making this choice.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So on some level, you know, he's not he is an avatar of what we.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And he had a career of doing that.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I'm not sure that Harris has that kind of instincts or experience to know where that is.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Which means, you know, I don't think she had the same like political rudder that Biden has now, you know, we were happy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, there's I'm just a little bothered by a lot of you know, she made these decisions, right: and it seems odd that like there hasn't been much credit for that assigned to her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Chris Stierwald's commentary offers an insightful breakdown of why Pennsylvania is a crucial battleground state, elucidating the factors that could decisively influence Harris's prospects for victory.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In stark contrast, Donald Trump's campaign succeeded in securing around 20,000 more votes in this key area compared to Clinton, signaling a shift in voter sentiment that Harris must address.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"However, if Trump is able to broaden his appeal and maintain strong support in these regions, it could pose a formidable challenge to Harris's campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris's challenge lies in not only maintaining democratic turnout in these counties, but also in appealing to moderate and undecided voters who may feel alienated by either party.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Conversely, a decrease in turnout compared to the 2020 election could tilt the scales in favor of Trump, enabling him to reclaim previously democratic strongholds.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"For Harris to capitalize on this, she must not only mobilize these demographics, but also craft a narrative that resonates with independents and moderate republicans.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Successfully appealing to a broad coalition will be vital for her electoral strategy.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The stark contrast between the Democratic stronghold of Philadelphia, a vibrant urban center characterized by its diverse and progressive population, and the Republican-leaning rural areas illustrates the pressing need for Harris to engage effectively with both segments of the electorate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The success of Harris's campaign hinges on her ability to bridge this significant divide, ensuring that her messaging resonates with urban voters who prioritize social justice, equality, and health care, while simultaneously addressing the concerns of rural voters who are more focused on economic recovery, job creation, and the revitalization of their communities.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For Harris to achieve a victorious outcome, she must inspire and galvanize high voter turnout in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburban areas, where a significant concentration of educated voters, particularly women and minorities, resides.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If Harris can effectively mobilize these groups, coupled with sustained enthusiasm from her core base, she could create a formidable coalition that significantly enhances her electoral prospects.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris's challenge lies not only in maintaining democratic turnout in these pivotal counties, but also in crafting messages that resonate with moderate and undecided voters who may feel alienated by the prevailing political discourse.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Furthermore, the historical voting patterns of Pennsylvania complicate Harris's path to victory even further.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris must present a compelling economic vision that not only appeals to urban voters, but also resonates deeply with rural constituents who may be experiencing significant economic distress.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Crafting policies that promise job creation, economic revitalization, and robust support for the working class will be crucial components of her campaign strategy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Another vital aspect to consider is the sentiment analysis surrounding Harris's campaign, which will significantly influence her electoral strategy.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The public's perception of her as a candidate, along with her ability to forge authentic connections with voters, will play a critical role in determining turnout and overall support.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In an age where social media platforms dominate the communication landscape, Harris must adeptly utilize these channels to convey her message and engage with the electorate effectively.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Authenticity in her messaging, combined with a willingness to address voter concerns directly, can help foster a sense of trust and connection that is essential for electoral success.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Additionally, if rural voters perceive her as disconnected from their needs and aspirations, it could lead to significant losses in key counties that have historically swung elections.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The potential impacts of Harris's campaign in Pennsylvania extend beyond the immediate electoral outcome.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris's ability to forge meaningful connections with various voter blocs, articulate a compelling economic vision that addresses diverse concerns, and effectively leverage sentiment analysis in her campaigning will be of utmost importance.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Ladies and gentlemen, American German Bulldog Nation, welcome to the Eric Dieter Show, well Trump had a Pennsylvania rally yesterday and he held up the, not held up, but he had the girl that came out that prepared his big chart that he says saved his life and it was a rip roaring rally and he let come on, there is habit.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, trump went to the black journals yesterday.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's caught, by the way, I hate to say it, he reminds me of myself in these situations because that's the way I would handle it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he's just direct, he went into the lion's den.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He turned it around.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump says social security should not be taxed.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, iran, trump had crippled Iran.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"With his sanctions after Biden and, uh, uh, Obama helped him out.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Cause he, you know, Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania said he was weird that he hugged the flag.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump hugged the flag.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I love that he fires back.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's a weird person.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala's anti-Catholic, according to Trump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But she's even worse for the Jews.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He says, Kamala's face.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris plans to introduce her new running mate at a rally this evening in Philadelphia.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists, Shapiro, Arizona U.S. Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, consideration of Shapiro has drawn criticism from some Arab-Americans and activist groups wary of his professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas during the war in Gaza.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, after their Pennsylvania debut, Harris and her new running mate planned visits together throughout the week to key battleground states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Republican Donald Trump also created some suspense by holding off on making his choice of a running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, until last month's Republican National Convention, vance, by the way, will stump in Philly today as well.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is doubling down on his appeal to the state's industrial workers and rural communities, emphasizing his commitments to job creation and energy independence.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
His campaign is particularly focused on regions where industries like coal and manufacturing are vital.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"On the other hand, Harris is focusing on expanding healthcare access, addressing climate change, and promoting social justice to energize urban voters with younger demographics, and the state's growing minority populations.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Thank you, starting with the seventh poll, conducted by Spry Strategies from August 14th to 20, with 600 likely voters, Harris received 48% of the vote, while Trump received 47%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris leads this poll by one point.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Moving forward to the sixth poll, also conducted by Spry Strategies on the same dates with a different 600 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 45%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Again, Harris leads this poll by one point.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Next up, in the fifth poll, conducted by Fabrizio Ward from August 19th to 21, with 400 likely voters, Harris received 43% of the vote, while Trump also received 43%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In the fourth poll, also conducted by Fabrizio Ward, on the exact same dates with a different 400 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 47%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Trump was barely able to beat Harris in this poll by a single point.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Shifting to the third poll, conducted by active vote from August 5th to 22, with 400 likely voters, Harris received 51% of the vote, while Trump received 49%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris leads this poll by two points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In the second poll, conducted by SoCal Strategies on August 23rd, with 800 registered voters, Harris received 47% of the vote, while Trump also received 47%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This shows how tight the battle is, in today's final poll, also conducted by SoCal Strategies on the same date with 713 likely voters, Harris received 47% of the vote, while Trump received 48%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Trump won this poll by one point.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris led in three out of the seven polls, with points ranging from one to two.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"However, Trump shows that he remains highly competitive by winning in two polls and tying in two polls.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, some union households have been swayed by Trump's economic and trade policies.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right now, the two candidates are locked in a dead heat in the Keystone State, Harris holding a slim lead of only seven-tenths of a percent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's also expected to make a stop by a black-owned small business in Erie as the campaign is announcing a new effort today to build support among black voters like promoting proposals that give black men more economic opportunities.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now while Trump is on the other side of the state, Harris is focusing on Erie County, as we said, this bellwether area, trying to win the state's 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Pretty much I like the way he, maybe not all the things he says, you know what I mean: it's kind of rough, but he gets results.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So Donald Trump has finally made an endorsement in Pennsylvania for the Senate race and he has endorsed none other than Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Trump has endorsed him which has made him the front-runner in this race.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So let's dive into this Trump endorsed Dr. Oz in the Senate race.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And this is what it comes down to, and Trump has this approach to endorsing which is very controversial.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But Dr. Oz has been that guy in Trump's circle, extended circle for a while.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But I want to get into Trump's endorsement passage of him, which honestly made the endorsement worse, in my opinion.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Let's look at this endorsement draft that Trump drafted up here talking about.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Like I just can't get over this like electability thing and then Trump is buying into it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And it's crazy because Trump endorsed Sean Parnell early on and rightfully so.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Trump has an ego to him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's never going to back down, never going to apologize, we like that about him, but he doesn't at the same time want to endorse candidates that he feels like even with his endorsement can lose.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's a problem, so he's going to go out there and endorse Dr. Oz.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Maybe he sees him as the lesser of two evils, but he'll endorse him anyways because of my eloped ability.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And it's unfortunate, i mean, there's a lot of great candidates that could easily get a Trump endorsement.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And even if they would still fall short, I'd rather have Trump fall short with somebody good and have the week end up winning the primary, than have Trump endorse the week and have them win the primary by a resounding margin.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Do you guys think this was the right move for Trump, or do you think that he should have endorsed one of the lesser known candidates, whether it would be Gale or Barnett or whoever: just let me know in the comments down below.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Why do you think Kamala is different: oh, I don't know.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She first off, she doesn't seem to be part of the establishment.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She does seem to be an outside figure.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is going to represent a no vote against things that have been perceived has been going on for some time.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If Trump can run up a big margin and Westmoreland County, Butler County, Greene County, those counties, and that if he can run up a big enough margin in the Carl account counties of Pittsburgh, he has a shot at it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And here's how he explains Erie County, a mix of urban, rural and labor, a great patchwork of Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris has less than a single percentage point lead there.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Maybe there are some Trump voters who won't pull the lever from McCormick because they think he's a carpet bagger or whatnot.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This race is different, he's actually pulling ahead of a lot of Republicans and helping them.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, I can tell you originally Republican leaders were looking at places like Ohio, places that are super red, that Donald Trump is expected to carry by a wide margin thinking that Sherrod Brown was frankly toast.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And on these issues, Donald Trump and Republicans for large clearly have the advantage.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that is true, i mean, they've been repelled by Trump because of abortion, because of J.D. Vance's childless cat lady comments, because of Trump's temperament, but Donald Trump has almost given up on wooing women.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he has very much leaned into trying to target men, not just conservative men, but sort of socially liberal men, Latino men, black men.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he's had some success with that, such that the Harris team is now worried.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But one last thing I'll mention on this, Lindsay, and that is if it comes to a boys versus girls election, Harris still does have the advantage.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You could see a Harris victory, a Trump victory helping one or either of these candidates, or maybe people are gonna split their tickets.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's huge, that's a net margin of point two That's huge So any one or two percent is massive even if you don't get anywhere close to most of it Even if at a two percent you get point four but Trump only gets point one That's huge because that's a point two margin and likely you'd probably getting even larger than that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is a really really big deal for the race Because again even like the smallest of a margin if you have two percent 1.5 votes time and then you get point four and Trump gets point one.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There was an instance where Kamala Harris showed up at a restaurant that was full of supporters and it turned out that they had cleared out the restaurant and bust in a bunch of supporters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But it is in keeping with the kind of campaign that Kamala Harris and Tim Walts have been running, which is one that's all about style and image and appearance and has very little substance to back it up.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump did win the state in 2016.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We've seen Trump do really well in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's had a lot of rallies, but they're all out there in PA all the time.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The crowd roared with excitement and enthusiasm as Biden and Harris took the stage, their energy infectious.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris faces a unique challenge.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She needs to convince voters she represents both continuity and change.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her campaign strategy reflects this delicate balance.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She embraces the successes of the Biden administration, particularly on affordable health care and economic opportunity.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"However, Harris also understands the need to distinguish herself.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She brings her own unique voice and perspective to the race.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This approach stands in stark contrast to the divisive politics of her opponents.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is a seasoned politician with a deep understanding of the complex issues facing the nation today.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She has articulated clear and concise positions on a wide range of topics, from health care and immigration, to foreign policy and climate change.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"On health care, Harris has been a vocal advocate for expanding access to affordable and quality coverage.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She supports strengthening the Affordable Care Act and lowering the exorbitant cost of prescription drugs.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"On immigration, Harris has called for comprehensive reform that provides a clear pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She believes in securing the border while also upholding the values of compassion, fairness, and due process.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her experience as the daughter of immigrants has given her a unique and valuable perspective on the challenges and opportunities presented by immigration.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris faces an uphill battle, but she is a formidable candidate with a compelling message that resonates with many.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her campaign has the potential to unite the Democratic Party and inspire voters across the political spectrum, bringing together a coalition of diverse voices.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The next few months will be crucial for Harris as she works to build momentum and gain the trust of undecided voters.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She needs to continue to articulate her vision for the country and connect with voters on a personal level, addressing their concerns and aspirations.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The upcoming debates will provide her with a valuable opportunity to draw a contrast between her approach and that of her opponents, showcasing her leadership qualities.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If she can successfully navigate the challenges ahead, she has a real chance of making history as the nation's first female president, breaking barriers and setting new precedents.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris represents a path forward, a path towards a more just and equitable society, where every voice is heard and valued.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So I would love to give this to Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So is that the reason why someone like former President Trump appeals to you because he has been canceled in a similar manner: absolutely.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, whether if he accepts money or not, he's made of money prior to all this.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He could be his own man and he says what he's what is on his mind and he's been consistent through the decades.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So that's why he's got my vote.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Coming down to the wire, presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is spending her Sunday meeting with the top contenders to be her running mate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her decision is expected to come very, very soon as Democratic delegates wrap up their roll call vote tomorrow.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Whoever Harris does select as her number two could have an impact on this race.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Take a look with Kamala Harris having a one point edge over former President Donald Trump nationally.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now one person said to be in the running for Harris's VP Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But of course here a lot of support among Pennsylvania Democrats for Harris to choose Shapiro.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Remember, it was only two weeks ago that President Biden exited the race and that the party rallied behind Harris to replace him at the top of the ticket.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, Donald Trump was not out on the campaign trail today.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yesterday, he and his running mate, JD Vance, attended a rally in the swing state of Georgia.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now Trump appears to be having momentum with many polls moving in his direction, but one state could be make or break for both campaigns, both candidates.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In addition to that, he's being joined by Elon Musk on the trail as well in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's why President Trump is spending significant time there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he's also spending time there because he loves Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He loves the people of Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He went to college in the state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So he has a long history with the Commonwealth.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So he's going to continue to visit Pennsylvania to make that case to the American people.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Will this Trump campaign: that's right.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, president Trump is on his way to Michigan shortly.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He will be doing a big rally tonight in Detroit, and he'll also be visiting a campaign office in an Arab American community in which the mayor actually endorsed him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's picking up historic gains, and it shows Kamala Harris is on defense with these supporters that have typically been key to the Democrat Party's electoral success.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Seven million viewers watched Kamala Harris on Fox News.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You're not Donald Trump, but nothing comes to mind that you would do differently.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, after months of really getting slammed for not doing interviews, Harris did sit down with Brit Bears you just saw on Fox News.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris was angry.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She was defensive, she couldn't give a single answer to a single question because the truth is the sad truth is Kamala Harris doesn't have answers.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her campaign is based upon lies about President Trump.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
You heard her talk more about President Trump in that interview than what she's going to do for the American people.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She was asked very a very simple question.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She should have that off the top of her head and she refused to answer it because she refuses to take responsibility for the unprecedented crisis that we have at our southern border.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And if she can't recognize there's a problem, how is she going to be trusted to fix the problem: she can't.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She will continue, allow it to continue.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Because Kamala can't handle the pressure of an interview with Fox News, she certainly can't handle the pressure of being president of the United States.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He has a real plan to make this country competitive again in terms of business.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's going to cut the business tax rate to 15 percent, but only for companies that make their product in America and hire American workers is going to make America competitive again and bring jobs back here at home.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Polling is indicating that Trump is actually polling better than a lot of Republican candidates have in the past among Hispanic voters.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What do you think in terms of I know Trump calling for mass deportations.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is in a heavily Republican area of a version of a part of that state.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's outside of Pittsburgh.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's in a steel town.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's got people with hard hats sitting there behind him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Talk to me about this appeal that Trump is trying to make to these rural voters, trying to run up the margins there.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And as for those workers right, the whole essence of Trump's Make America Great Again really economically rests on his notion that America should make things again, manufacture this part of America, obviously, with the steel mills, which left 40 years ago there.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm going to bring that back entirely, but he thinks that the offshoring of American manufacturing, which was accomplished, essentially by investors over the course of many decades, was a mistake.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's a point of difference that he can underline for these workers as well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He has and he will.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He believes that Make America Great Again means making America back to work in those industrial era industries that he believes should be onshore taken back, especially after the pandemic.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's a key part of his appeal here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And in fact, there's numbers that back that up in Cambria County, where Donald Trump is speaking right now since 2019, when New York Times found it, I thought this was interesting, that they have actually six percent fewer jobs from 2019 to 2023.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Do you think that that works in Donald Trump's favor, some of these counties feeling left behind: no question.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"His appeal, what comes to places like Johnstown, which isn't often visited by presidential candidates in previous elections, is because this is where America got left behind, where people, when they offshored the steel industry and other manufacturing industries and even during the Biden administration, right, those inflation numbers, those jobs numbers, it's not even across the country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I can't even get by here, that is a clarion call that Trump is making to people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He can turn that around, now, can he: i don't know, but they certainly blame the current administration.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is trying to penetrate that.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her campaign is trying to appeal to rural Democrats to try to offset any gains Trump would make in those rural Republican heavy counties.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Here is what Trump said about that, and it's kind of illustrative as to his thoughts on the abortion issue in general.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And remember, Trump has bragged about appointing those three Supreme Court justices that were instrumental in overturning Roe.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He said about how he would vote, quote, he said first he would be voting no.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And then he said, I think six weeks, which is the state law in Florida, you need more time than six weeks.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So he seems to try to kind of split the issue here and say that he doesn't agree with the six week ban, but he's also going to vote no on the ballot measure that would overturn the six week ban.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"How is this going to play in your view with suburban women voters, particularly there in Pennsylvania, that Trump has got to make inroads with if he wants to be successful: well, there's no question, Jake, the reason he is saying these things that and also the fact that he now wants the government to pay for IVF treatments, which Catholic Southern Baptist, a lot of pro-life anti-abortion rights people believe is the equivalent of abortion, because there are many embryos that get discarded.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump wants no part of that because he sees the mainstream.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Terry Moran live from that Trump event in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"While preparing for the debate, a source tells CBS News that Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke over the phone this weekend.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Clinton, who debated Trump three times during the 2016 election, offered her advice.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris has also been preparing by holding mock debates.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, sources say Trump's preparation has included reviewing policy positions with advisers.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump won a coin toss last week to decide podium placement or the order of the closing statements.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He elected to have the final statement of the night.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He is the political editor of KDKA, our station in Pittsburgh.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You've talked to many of the members of the Cabinet currently, former President Trump, Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, I think it's true that there's a lot of hardening of the lines in support of Donald Trump or Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And of course, it's one that I'm sure the campaigns have agonized over for months, trying to figure out if I'm in a debate, what am I going to say and do: i think for Donald Trump, it's really to reassure.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"For Donald Trump, I think it's to reassure people that he's not nuts, that he's not crazy, that he doesn't go off the wall one way or the other, that he's not a misogynist, that he's not somebody who just attacks, attacks, attacks, but rather focuses on his accomplishments during the four years of the Trump administration.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"For Kamala Harris, I think it's reassuring people that she's really up for the job.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
There's a lot of questioning as to whether or not she is capable of doing this job.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I think there's every reason to believe she is.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"After all, she's been vice president, a U.S. senator, a state attorney general, a district attorney.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, she's got years of government experience, far more than Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But the question is reassuring people that she's on top and that she has specific policies that people want to hear about.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think that's her goal tonight.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so whether you harken back to the Donald Trump future, because he would say that's what he's delivering in the future or to a different vision of the future from Kamala Harris, I think both these candidates will need to tie that into their message this evening.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I will let you know exactly why the reason is that Kamala Harris is going to ultimately win the state of Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And then from American Pulse Research and polling, we have Trump with a slight lead on Harris on those two polls.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But on average here, Harris does have a slight lead in the days leading up to the election on November 5th.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, why is it that this is very good news for Kamala Harris in the final days leading up to what will be the most consequential, the most important state for either candidate to have a smooth sailing path to victory on election night: the reasons are that Pennsylvania is a extremely diverse, extremely blue collar state, and is also a very large population.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump struggles with nearly all of those groups of voters, and in 2016, he was able to win over voters with a populist message, right: he talked the talk of raising the minimum wage and keeping jobs and manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania and in America.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And people bought it up because he was an unknown commodity.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's not much that the Trump campaign is offering you if you are somebody who just wants to keep jobs in America, right: you're somebody who wants to keep the train on the tracks with the economy and you want to just generally be able to provide for your family and live a normal life, working a job that might not necessarily require a college degree and you don't, I don't see anything that's been offered to the American people, especially these types of voters that there are a lot of in Pennsylvania, economic minded blue collar voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump was able to win them over in 2016 by lying to them but his track record hasn't given them anything to gravitate to, especially since 2020 and also since he got elected and I think that his various troubles that he's having legally, it's gonna come to bear in a very important state like Pennsylvania in this upcoming election but that's all I got for you guys in this one, please be sure to like the video, subscribe to the channel, share with someone who's into politics and I'll catch you guys in the next video, peace.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Alright man, so we got some absolutely huge news here for the Kamala Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So I did previously report on how Kamala Harris is actually already gearing up for a legal battle for the election results after.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump is basically already saying that he's going to deny the election results regardless of what ends up happening.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he ends up losing, I think he even said that he would win California if Jesus was the vote counter.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So he's very clear that he's obviously going to try to steal the election again, just like he did last time.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But Kamala Harris, as generally her campaign has been operating, is actually operating in a proactive manner as opposed to a reactive manner.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So she's preparing prior to that as opposed to reacting, right: so the reports are currently saying that she's already amassed a legal team about 10 times the size.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But this is huge, huge news, again, this story going back says Kamala Harris hires a massive legal team to fight back against election denials.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The number of lawyers on her staff is huge in comparison to what we saw with President Biden in 2020.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This news comes after their rumblings that Republicans will seek to have a repeat of the 2020 where Donald Trump and his supporters spread election misinformation in an effort to undermine President Biden's win.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala has clearly proven that she's sort of more of a proactive person.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's been reaching out to House surrogates almost immediately after she was chosen to be the nominee.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Obviously she couldn't do that prior to her becoming the nominee or before Biden had dropped out of me not becoming the nominee.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But also she was actually ready for this whole situation in terms of becoming the nominee for 2028, but it was triggered prior.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so I think Kamala Harris needs to make sure she's continuing to fight these legal matters right now and then obviously being prepared for what happens later, what comes later.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So really, really good news for the Kamala Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If Donald Trump wins the 2024 election, will you trust the results: yes, I will.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, i believe so, but I know if Kamala gets in, we're going to have World War III.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yes, sir, and it says Trump that bitch: yes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I pulled him out of school for that day.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So are you saying that Kamala Harris is actually wearing earbuds: yes.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"When she goes into a debate, take out her earrings.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You're saying she should have to not wear her earrings, you see Trump going in with an earring, does that feel like a conspiracy theory a little bit: we're done.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In the form of President Trump, what is going to be your tax policy in your next administration should you win: thank you for the great question, but unfortunately, I do not speak to fake news.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"A very accurate Donald Trump impression, actually, saw him here in Erie, Pennsylvania, before.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I just know I want him to get in and I don't want Camilla in.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if Donald Trump doesn't win, will you be upset: oh, yeah.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's letting all these people from other countries come over here.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It's not good, and how long would you say you've been a supporter of Donald Trump: i've really only voted once in my life, but I think I might vote this year.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, a lot of people accuse Trump of not paying bills in his construction company.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Did he pay his bills, did people like working with it: of course he did.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He always paid his bills: yes.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yes, he did, okay.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, he pays his bills.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There was the best 10 to 12- He got a bill for $35,129 that he refused to pay.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Great, you have a shirt here and it's Trump, and then you've put duct tape over another name.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And why did you put the tape over Mike Pence's name there: well, it's not just because he refused to decertify the election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's because Mike Pence has come out as the rhino that he's always been and said that those of us that vote for Trump are toxic.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Did you put the tape over Mike Pence's name because you believe he should have refused to certify the election results: well, I felt that way at the time.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So in this next election, Kamala Harris, she's the Vice President.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Correct, if she loses the election and then decides that she says there's voter fraud and things like that, and she decides she is not going to certify the election results, how will you feel about that: i don't know.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right, if Trump wins and she refuses to certify the election results, how will you feel: well, that's her right.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She can refuse to certify, that's her right.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But if she refuses to certify and then makes herself president, you'd be OK with that: no.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The old tank, let's go America.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, yes, sir, is this how you picture Donald Trump: yeah.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump wearing shirtless with a very tight body.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Is that is is that what do you think he looks like with his shirt up: possibly.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If you had to bet on it, do you think that's what he looks like with his shirt up: just hopeful thinking I guess.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Why wouldn't you want to be here to cheer this fellow on, what makes Donald Trump so special: oh, my goodness.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"His honesty, his bravery, donald Trump, you think he's a very honest guy: oh, he's horrifically, wonderfully honest.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Horrifically honest, and wonderfully honest, so he said that he won the 2020 election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He said just just the other day, we actually lost it by a whisker.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, maybe he's had more pertinent information.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Any final message you would leave for Donald Trump if you were watching this: just watch.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You trust the election if Trump wins.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And do you think the founding fathers would have been disappointed in the failure of Trump to transfer power peacefully: i don't think he should have had to transfer power at all.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think he won.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, but he lost in an election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So Trump was losing in Ohio and in Florida that night.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It was called a blue mirage.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump was never accused of inciting insurrection.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Oprah, New York, oh, Donald Trump, they loved and loved and loved.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Are you excited to be at a Trump rally right now: i'm very excited.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What makes you so excited to be at a Trump rally: if I can get in just to see Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
To see Trump would fill you with joy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Oh, yeah, do you do you feel like Trump gives you joy on a daily basis: yes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's averages in the state seem to have solidified in Georgia slightly ahead of North Carolina and Arizona which would put him at about 262 electoral votes but still shy of of course what he would need.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris has the slimmest of margins in the averages in Pennsylvania, slightly wider margin in Michigan and depending on whose average you're looking at either up or down in the state of Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If you look at polls Trump is leading men by I think in the in an August Wall Street Journal poll he's leading men by about 10 points, Harris is leading women by about 13.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Of course there's been a lot of media coverage of Harris's outreach to black men in particular.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The Trump campaign of course had a field day with with that with those remarks there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I mean there are a lot of women out there who are who are you know put off by Trump's personality or are concerned about abortion.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That exploded with Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
If Trump is somehow able to even raise the margins further in Metro Pittsburgh that will offset some of his expected losses in Philadelphia collar.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But it's all about the margins in Trump countries.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And then you know Trump has always run as an economic populist since he walked down that golden escalator nine years ago I guess almost a decade since he's been on the political scene.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You know he's always been a supporter of tariffs.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But in these past final few months he's proposed no taxes on tips and overtime pay a 10 percent credit card interest rate half temporarily a 10 percent which was kind of interesting federal government coverage of IVF that certainly came as a surprise to a lot of people.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So the reason I think it's important to talk about this is you know we're just a couple weeks out from Election Day and if if Trump manages to win the White House if they flip the Senate even if they don't hold on to the House you know there would be a lot of really interesting fascinating conversations in the GOP about about trade and economic policy and of course foreign policy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think that Trump's decision to pick Vance as his running mate signals that that's kind of where he wants the party to move.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's where I spend the majority of my time and you know looking if Trump does win there's certainly that old guard new guard Republican tensions that we've really been seeing since 2017.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But what's different now like especially looking at the House is that the the makeup of the Republican Conference is far more Trump aligned and Trump comfortable now compared to in 2017 when you have a lot of House Republicans who had been there and even newer House Republicans who are rejecting kind of Trump's economic message.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now a lot of them get on board the ones who don't get on board some have retired some have left some have been primary voted out and what's left is a conference that is much more aligned with the Trump agenda than what we saw in a first term.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So you know when you're looking at economic policy when you're looking at foreign policy that certainly played out over this last year on Ukraine where even without a Trump presidency Trump had a lot of influence in the discussions among the Republican Conference the influence of the Freedom Caucus.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So expect those tensions to still be there if Trump is elected but it's certainly a conference much more aligned with his economic message than what we had in a first Trump term.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Well I think that's a great way to kind of wrap things up and especially on where things are right now where things can be going direction in the future because of course in the event that Donald Trump is elected on November the 5th and over the 6th the 2028 campaign begins effectively.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let's start here, vice President Kamala Harris and her newly announced running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, are out on the campaign trail.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Vice President Harris hailed her new running mate as a veteran, six term congressman and two term governor who is prepared to take on their rivals.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris offered it to him Tuesday morning as campaign cameras rolled.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Make no mistake, violent crime was up under Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's not even counting the crimes he committed.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he wants to win, Donald Trump must win the key swing state of Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And yeah, it would hurt if Trump were to lose Pennsylvania, but it's not the end of the world.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's going to be the state that if Trump wins it, he's probably going to win the presidency.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
If Harris wins it.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, I want to be clear that I am not saying there is no pathway for Trump if he loses Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like, if he loses it, yeah, of course, there are many pathways for Trump here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But outside of that, you cannot lose a single state of your Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Again, it could happen where Trump could win Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And at that point, I think Harris the favorite, because if you lose a single state of your Trump, not just, you know, oh, he could afford to lose Wisconsin, but still win somewhere else.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"No, he cannot lose any of these states except Nevada.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Because if he does, mathematically speaking, Harris at above 270.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Again, that doesn't mean Trump's going to for sure lose if he loses the state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But unlike Kamala Harris, I think Trump needs Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I really believe that, because while yes, Harris, if she loses Pennsylvania, it becomes very difficult for her to win.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Even then, Trump could theoretically win Wisconsin, but he could still lose.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So Harris, if she wins it, I really think she's got the presidency.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But if she loses it, well, it becomes very difficult.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But I think it's much more plausible that this happens than, oh, yeah, Trump is able to run the table everywhere else.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If he loses Pennsylvania, he's done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, 80,000 votes separated Trump and Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Because she has none.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This idea that she's going to magically do better than Joe in places like Scranton, Erie, even Pittsburgh, maybe the suburbs, maybe, but do you think the average blue collar voter in Bucks County or even Philly, do you believe those voters, who they might have voted for Joe back in 2020, do you think they're going to vote for Harris: no, they're not going to.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So if Trump is up in Pennsylvania, well, go back to the map here.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"If we assume Trump is up in Pennsylvania again, this is a hypothetical.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is much more simpler than, oh yeah, by the way, Trump cannot afford to lose Wisconsin if he does.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's over here, it's no, he can afford to lose.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now he can't afford to lose, actually, he can't afford to lose Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He just needs Arizona at that point or vice versa.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Trump campaign should throw everything at the state, not just invest some resources.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You guys know the people who have Donald Trump, everything very hard.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Between the people in real life that are going to be gullible enough to believe that this is some sort of ploy about the radical left to eliminate Donald Trump because he's the savior and the people online that are using him as a hype machine because he has so much aura and this pic goes so hard.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The things that are going to happen are going to happen anyway either president, it doesn't matter but that does not mean that I want Trump to get in.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
All right everybody saw the Trump rally where he was potentially you know tried to be taken and one or two things could be true.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump could have said this up himself so people will rally behind him so he could win the presidency or somebody fucking missed.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump you better you better keep your head low you better keep your head low that was probably the first war.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
While Trump was on stage at a rally in Pennsylvania a sniper from some distance attempted to assassinate him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Missed him though just grazed his ear.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The man was set up quick and easy no musk no fuss on a building right across the way how does that happen: okay it's cooked as of like an hour ago what appeared to be gunshots rang out at a Trump rally he went down he got back up his ear and his face appeared to be bloody and he's doing a fist pump in the air.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Mind you when it comes to policies socioeconomic status his race well every fucking thing about him he is not a victim and nor is the majority of his fans but shit now they are I guess because you know the right wing spin factory is a fucking machine.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump is going to mention this event in every single fucking appearance moving forward the right is going to make t-shirts and mugs and merchandise out of it he apparently mouthed the word fight so expect to see that picture with some filters on it with the fight thing or some tiktok edits expect for the right to get even more radical because of this event and as more information comes out about whatever happened if this was a shooting and that shooter has any left-wing beliefs at any point I'm talking if they liked AOC's tweak at one point in their life it's fucked because anything that you say against Trump will now be painted as oh they're too radical and look this rhetoric caused yeah.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This despite the fact that shootings for literally every reason over the past however many years have been by right-wing people who follow all these right-wing demagogues that are about to be like the leftist what caused this and everything and use this as their opportunity expect to see people pulling comments online of people previously talking about how Trump should get you know.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And how he miss JP how he miss bar: he missed.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He missed on purpose.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Recent polls show that not just black men and black voters, but even Latin Americans are pivoting towards Donald Trump over Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Among Hispanic voters, Donald Trump is seeing a rise among Latino men, while Hispanic women still support Kamala Harris in large numbers.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Trump is trying to change the tide.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He knows that he's growing popular among the Hispanic community.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Democrats are reaching out to people of color, and so is Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He already enjoys the support of white male voters by an overwhelming number.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris just can't catch a break.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A resurfaced clip from 2019 is blowing up, it's reminding everyone about her nutty anti-fracking stance.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now with Pennsylvania in place, she's trying to backpedal.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"How convenient, right: the people aren't letting her get away with it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"We'll cover her flip-flop, why voters aren't buying it, and why this lie in particular is extremely important for voters in states like Pennsylvania and others.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Alright, so Kamala Harris, remember her: well she's found herself in hot water again and this time it's thanks to a little something from 2019 that has come back to haunt her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
You see back then Harris was proudly declaring that climate change is the single greatest threat facing our world today.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, and she wasn't stopping there.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She was saying also that she was committed to passing the Green New Deal.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris's stance back then was loud and clear.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She was all in on banning fracking and shoving the Green New Deal down America's throat.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But who how times have changed, as soon as Kamala set her sights on the White House, things got, shall we say, flexible.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In a recent interview on CNN with Dana Bash, who asked her about her stance in 2019, she made a complete U-turn.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now Dana Bash's credit, what she just asked her there was, well, you said that your values have not changed.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"My values have not changed, again, she keeps saying my values have not changed.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's what she said, what I have seen is that we can we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"How is that possible, Kamala: and she won't explain it because she has no idea what she's saying.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So in a nutshell, Kamala Harris is lying about not wanting to ban fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She is the vice president to Joe Biden, who in 2020 went out of his way to certify his position that fossil fuel will go away under him.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Remember when he looked at young woman in the eye and said, look me in the eye when I'm president, fossil fuels will be no more.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, I never heard Kamala come in and say, do you mean fracking to Joe: because we shouldn't ban fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She was all in then, she's all in now.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's just trying to get the votes.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Harris currently holds a razor thin lead here.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
No clear politics puts her at forty eight point three percent compared to Trump with forty seven point six.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now Trump is always undercounted, but still, so naturally Trump isn't wasting any time.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's pointing out her flip flop and even warning during the last debate that fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one if she's elected.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's very good work for the people that Kamala Harris traditionally doesn't give a shit about.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, let's get real for a second, who's actually buying this sudden change of heart: she was anti fracking in twenty nineteen and we all know that's still her stance, no matter what she says now.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And get this, this latest gaffe might just cost her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala is lying to the people for their votes about their very livelihood.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's lying to them and hoping that she'll get through to them with the lie so that she can put them out of work.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Even that's a bold place lie, but she threw out some more words out because he didn't have an answer.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"When Trump was asked the question, he very succinctly said, drill baby drill.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"For example, a truck delivering groceries, fresh produce, say, if they don't factor in the cost of fuel to make the deliveries, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' high gas prices would make it so that the trucking company loses money.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris gives this lavish lifestyle mostly off of her campaign donations, wearing $900 shoes, $3,000 dresses and jewelry that cost more than my car.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania

"Kamala Harris sucks, right: she sucks.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Listen, I have served as governor under Joe Biden and under President Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yes, and when President Trump was in the White House, I got to get up every single day and be on offense.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when President Trump gets back in the White House, he is going to make sure that we don't have mediocre men taking away opportunities from our exceptional women.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"President Trump is somebody that I appreciate for his fight, his tenacity, his wisdom, and his ability to get things done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's a dealmaker, and he never loses sight of the American people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When I first saw him announce for president in 2016, I watched him on TV.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But not President Trump, he was going to be honest with you and genuine with you, and here is the situation and here is the truth.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He doesn't think he's any better than you.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
President Trump is himself.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's fighting for you.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's fighting to protect you and your family, and he loves this country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He loves this country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's listening to you right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania

"It's a former coal mining town in Luzerne County, a place Donald Trump won by more than 14 points in 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, crucially, his margin in 2020 was slimmer than it was in 2016 when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 19 points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris needs to keep her attention on places like Wilkes-Barre, where she is not going to win outright, but she could lose by less than her predecessor did.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And every little bit can help Harris get over the top and win the all-important state.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And you're seeing Vice President Harris do that with her stops in Wilkes-Barre and Johnstown today.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is Kamala Harris speaking to a local reporter in Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And now he's getting off on tangents on our people eating up their immigrants, eating pets in Springfield, Ohio.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And between 2016 and 2020, Donald Trump did marginally worse in 66 out of 67 counties from 2016 to 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He did worse, the only county he did marginally better in was Philadelphia, where he was beaten.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He was beaten badly there, but he did a little bit better there.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But every other county is where his margin slipped.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think Kamala Harris has demonstrated that she's that leader.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But Harris had to get herself adjusted on that issue because it speaks to a lot of working Americans who can identify with that industry.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"However, Trump's 2016 victory in Michigan marked a dramatic shift, as he won the state by a narrow margin of 0.2 percent, turning it red for the first time in decades.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This victory was part of Trump's broader success in flipping blue-collar states across the Midwest, which ultimately secured his electoral college WIN.IN 2020.Michigan swung back to the Democrats, with Joe Biden winning the state by just under 3 percent.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Trump's ability to energize rural voters and maintain his working-class base will be key to his campaign's success.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's populist economic messaging on trade and manufacturing resonated with many voters in these areas in 2016.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's 2016 promises to bring back jobs resonated strongly in the rust belt, and although his tariffs on steel and aluminum were popular with some voters, others became disillusioned as the manufacturing sector continued to struggle.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"With polls showing a dead heat between Harris and Trump, both campaigns will likely invest heavily in the state, focusing on turning out their base while appealing to undecided and swing voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The current polling data, showing Trump with a slight two-point lead over Harris, underscores how competitive Pennsylvania will be in 2024.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, Trump has maintained strong support in more rural parts of the state, particularly in the central and western regions, which are predominantly white and working class.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In contrast, Trump has focused on reducing government regulation and repealing parts of the Affordable Care Act, which has resonated with voters who prioritize limited government involvement in health care.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"With Trump holding a slight lead in the polls but the race well within the margin of error, both campaigns will need to focus heavily on turnout and messaging in key regions.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"According to a poll conducted between October 3 and 7, 2024, by Marist College, which surveyed 1,327 likely voters, Trump holds a commanding lead over Harris, with 52 percent of the vote compared to Harris's 46 percent, giving Trump a six-point advantage.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, Trump's victories in both 2016 and 2020 by margins of 8 and 7 points, respectively, have led many to question whether Ohio remains a battleground or if it has shifted into the Republican column.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The polling data showing Trump with a six-point lead over Harris in 2024 suggests that Ohio may be leaning more solidly Republican, at least in presidential elections.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Many of these voters, particularly in the eastern part of the state, were once part of the Democratic coalition but have shifted to the Republicans in response to Trump's populist economic message.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"While Trump performed well in some suburban areas in 2016, particularly among non-college-educated voters, the 2020 election saw a shift among college-educated voters, particularly women, toward the Democrats.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's message of economic nationalism, including his promises to bring back manufacturing jobs and renegotiate trade deals, resonated strongly with voters in the state in both 2016 and 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's appointments of conservative justices to the Supreme Court have been popular with these voters, and his stance on social issues has helped solidify his support in the state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"With Trump holding a solid lead in the polls, it appears that Ohio may be leaning more decisively Republican in 2024.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, Harris and the Democrats cannot afford to ignore the state, as a strong showing in Ohio could help bolster their chances in other key battlegrounds across the Midwest.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"As the polls currently stand, Trump holds narrow leads in Pennsylvania and Ohio, while Michigan is a virtual tide between Harris and Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And this is worrisome for her campaign for obvious reasons.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Well the markets have decided Kamala's got a 70% chance of winning.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's stunning and brave.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I believe that the Kamala Harris camp is getting nervous.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, the down ballaters aren't coordinating with the Kamala campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Meanwhile Trump has a different problem.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's got an extensive ground game with private volunteers and local field offices and stuff like that.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Much more grassroots, but at the same time you have Mitch McConnell bitching about him in his book and saying weird shit.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala surrounds herself with yes men and people who are sort of in the in the no apparatus.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So yeah Kamala is angry at the Pennsylvania state and local officials.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kind of can't blame her actually when you think about it.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Were you surprised that in a speech billed as being about the U.S. economy, Trump did veer off into so many other topics, even spending a lot of time talking about his former opponent, President Biden: no, I don't think surprised would be a word I would use for that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And as Kristen said, for the most part, he did talk about economic matters, all the signage of the event that will get replayed as people see the clips are about his proposals about no taxes on tips and on Social Security and the like.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He clearly, it is getting to him that Kamala Harris has signed on to that no taxes on tips policy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, here's the reality of what Trump did today, Wolf, which is sort of pre-butt what we are going to get from Kamala Harris on Friday when she is in that very same now very clear battleground state, North Carolina.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So he's trying to pre-butt that a little bit and to lean into an issue where he has an advantage right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, there was a new AP poll today that shows him with a seven percentage point advantage, 45 percent to 38 percent over Harris about who can better handle the economy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That's a better deficit for Harris than it was with Joe Biden on the issue of the economy.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But clearly issue number one for voters is still an advantage category for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Scott Jennings said Trump does hold an advantage over Kamala Harris on the issue of the economy.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Another poll shows this, 53 percent of Americans in this poll say Trump would do a better job with the economy compared to just 44 percent for Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So how much is he hurting himself when he loses focus on that specific issue: well, he wouldn't be hurting himself, but it sounds like today he kept his focus.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She has been billed as an influential adviser and policymaker in this administration.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
That's why Trump's got to keep bringing it up.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Don't quit whining about her, we knew it was going to be her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's not going to give an interview.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It's not going to win talking about whether she's dumb.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's crazy, you know why she hasn't done an interview: because she's not smart.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's not intelligent, all right.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And the name calling and the nastiness does not help Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Amisha Kamala Harris will follow Trump to North Carolina on Friday.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris has shown to not only bolster excitement amongst the Democratic coalition, she's also shown to expand that base and its reach, particularly with Gen Z, a lot of younger diverse voters were seeing the attacks on women's reproductive rights that have fallen flat for the right and they consistently continue to do so.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And all that we're seeing from Donald Trump time and time again, no matter where he's speaking, be it whether it's the press, whether it's on Twitter, it is always attacks on things of the past and bringing up taking America back.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris is winning right now, and I think Donald Trump is just waking up to that, which is why you're seeing some of the attacks and his return to X and the sort of meltdown of an interview with Elon Musk.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But the Harris campaign cannot get overconfident.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She needs to be running multiple points ahead.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She does have a deficit in some states that are key to win.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The bottom line being, there are states in play for Kamala Harris that weren't even a dream to Biden, and this race is a dead heat right now.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And of course, Trump is trying to take her back to her days in California when she was anti-Trump fracking.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But she's evolved, and she's changed that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She saw Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She's talked to people from Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And for the last four years, she's been acceptable and for fracking.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So I think she has to articulate that tonight.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So what are the main issues you think she has to articulate tonight: well, the first thing I think she has to do is be herself.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And she's such an authentic, nice, warm person.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She gets teased by the magotypes for her laughter and her smile.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But it's something that distinguishes her from Trump, who has no warmth.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The second thing is, I think she has to show the strength.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She has about a 13 percent advantage with women, but she's down 5 percent with men.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And it's not as if the Harris administration can push any old left wing legislation to the Congress.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And now we know what's happening, trump can't really rise above.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, everybody knows who he is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So he has to drag her down.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And you see that in all of his ads.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This places Trump ahead by a narrow margin of one percentage point.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's base continues to rally around his messages on the economy, particularly his approach to job creation and business regulation.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"On the other hand, Harris's supporters emphasize the importance of progressive policies, particularly those aimed at healthcare reform and social equity.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris may focus on energizing younger voters and minorities, who have historically leaned Democratic but may need additional motivation to turn out in significant numbers.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump, conversely, might aim to consolidate support among working-class voters, particularly in rural areas and small towns, which have been pivotal in previous elections.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This poll indicates that Trump maintains a slight lead, but the contest remains competitive.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's messaging often resonates with voters concerned about border security and economic opportunities.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"While Harris's platform addresses the need for comprehensive immigration reform and public health initiatives.as the election approaches, both campaigns will need to tailor their strategies to appeal to Arizona's diverse electorate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Mobilizing younger voters and independents will also be essential to bridge the gap and potentially overcome Trump's lead.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump, on the other hand, may focus on reinforcing his support among rural voters and those in suburban areas who prioritize economic issues and law enforcement.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
His campaigns messaging around restoring order and promoting economic growth could resonate well in these demographics.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"According to a poll conducted by Emerson College between October 5th and 8th, involving 900 likely voters, Kamala Harris holds a lead with 49 percent compared to Donald Trump's 48 percent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This places Harris ahead by a narrow margin of one percentage point, illustrating a competitive race in this state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The results from this poll suggest that Harris's campaign may be resonating well with voters, particularly among those prioritizing issues such as health care, labor rights, and economic equity.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris's focus on labor issues and economic recovery may help solidify her support in this demographic.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For Harris, the challenge will be to maintain and expand her lead among key voter groups, including young voters and minorities, while also appealing to independent voters who may be swayed by economic messages.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her campaign could benefit from emphasizing the importance of accessible health care and economic opportunities for all Nevadans.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump, meanwhile, may need to pivot his strategy to address the specific concerns of Nevada voters, including those related to the tourism and hospitality industries, which are vital to the state's economy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
His messaging may focus on tax policies and regulatory changes that aim to boost job growth and economic stability in these sectors.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Finally, I think, Vice President Harris, whoever she picks, we're going to stand behind her, she's going to do a great job.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The treasury candidate remained unapologetic for her comments and doubled down on her thinny veil criticisms of Shapiro in an interview with the New York Post.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If I were in Harris' situation, I would think very strongly about the difficulties that some women experience being in a top-level position, and having men around them that have to be satisfied with being second, third, or answering to a woman, she told the outlet.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Color me, thunderstruck, she told the Post.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Washington Post national political reporter Ozzy Pibara, ozzy, we kept mentioning that Vice President Harris is now leading in national polls, but this election will most likely come down to a few battleground states, including Pennsylvania, where she and President Biden are today.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump has not won a popular vote in the elections where he's been at the top of the ballot.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But if you look at battleground states, where electoral votes are decided, it looks like Harris has a lead in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and even in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, what the electoral votes are, what is going to decide this election: donald Trump has had a challenge winning popular votes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So therefore his campaign has always been targeted to specifying particular areas, particular counties in crucial states and focusing their efforts on there.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
That was a political liability for Republicans and particularly for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He has been trying to find a way to claim ownership of this issue without the liability.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he has struggled with that, we just saw last week where one day he told another network that he was going to vote in a way that signaled his opposition to a six-week abortion ban in Florida.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And the very next day he said the opposite, saying that he was going to vote in favor of that law.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
This is a political liability for Republicans and specifically for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So I think the questions about Donald Trump's ability to perform the job for the four years, based on the statements and the ways conducted himself throughout the campaign, it was a critical point for Joe Biden, who had a very difficult debate performance back in June.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's also touting his tariff policy and vowing to take on the CCP.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"At 7 30 p.m. Eastern time tonight from a president Trump will take the stage right behind us here in Atlanta, Georgia for a speech on the economy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It comes as Trump is again laying out and defending his free policies in an interview with the Chicago Economic Club.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump touting his tariff policies for companies that are going to make their product in the USA.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But while Trump says his policies will bring companies back to the US without raising costs for consumers.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
In a statement the Harris campaign says Trump's proposals to raise the national sales tax will raise costs for families by thousands of dollars per year.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump on through social is calling on voters here to get out and vote saying quote if you have a ballot return it immediately and if not go vote at the polls right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's also taping a Fox News town hall here in Georgia which will air tomorrow at 11 a.m. Eastern time.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And the Harris camp also released a new radio ad targeting rural voters in battleground states.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Vice President Harris appeared on a live radio show in Detroit on Tuesday and Wednesday.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She'll sit down for a highly anticipated Fox News interview which is scheduled to air Wednesday night at 6 p.m. Reporting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Jason Blair, Entity News.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And as Harris gears up for her Fox News appearance, former President Trump intensifying his campaign efforts in key battleground states for their insights into the strategies of the two campaigns.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Brett Baier has been tough on Trump and I assume he's going to have tough questions for her.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But the real question here is, is that, you know, why won't Trump do this as well, why won't Trump go with Brett Baier and others, and what does he have to hide: i mean, I know what we all know what they're going to ask questions.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There's a lot there that she can answer to.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So I think she's going to do well.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I think she's doing it in a lot of reasons because the race is that close.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think she realizes that there are people that are going to come watch this.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So I think she sees this as an opportunity and a good one.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She has been asked these questions before.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I don't really think she puts a lot at risk there because of the way the campaign's been trending.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"How much to align with Biden versus how much to differentiate herself from him, what approach do you think would be the best path forward for her right now: i'm a big Joe Biden fan.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Chip, VP Harris recently announcing a new initiative in Pennsylvania aimed at black men to offer forgivable business loans to black entrepreneurs and create more apprenticeships.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"To your point, however, there's a brand new poll that just came out yesterday conducted by you go for CBS News and found that Harris has similar support for black voters as Joe Biden did in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And that is why Trump's going on these podcasts.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when he does, the reaction he gets from minorities or just young people in general is just it's outstanding.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And the reason is because he's not afraid to go out there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's not afraid to talk issues and just tell it like it is.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"People on the street interviews when they're talking about Kamala Harris is fake, just not real.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They don't know where she stands on anything.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Tonight, both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are campaigning in what some argue is the most important of all the battleground states this election.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump carried it narrowly by two percentage points in 2016.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm sure that's why Harris is there, and she has a message not just for Erie County, but statewide, correct: correct Major, this is actually going to be the vice president's 10th visit to Pennsylvania since becoming the presidential nominee.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And they are so well aware that even though this area in particular voted for President Biden back in 2020, there is plenty of opportunity for her to lose, which is why she's trying to meet face to face with as many people as she can to try to get her message across.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So right before she comes here to the arena, she is actually sitting down having a conversation with black men about the economy and about the opportunities that she claims she can create for them.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In fact, she's doing a media blitz like we've been talking about this week, focused on black media to try to pull in those voters, Major, because again, it is that enthusiasm that could make or break this election when you're talking about who wakes up and goes to the polls.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Competing with the crowd and the music around her, we did doing a gamely, as always.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"These events, but major, I can say after traveling with the Trump campaign for the past several months now, this is when they are starting to target these areas.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And when you look deep down in the numbers, Republican voters and especially those aligned with Donald Trump are very supportive of his argument.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We have not heard the last of Trump saying he could use the United States military to pursue the quote enemy from within.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump just got great news out of the key swing state of Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Like if Trump wins Pennsylvania more than likely he wins the presidency and vice versa.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
If Harris wins Pennsylvania more than likely she wins the presidency.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In just four years, that's a lot of voters especially in the state that Trump lost by roughly 80,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I don't think it's enough for Harris to win Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They're off by three points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But even then when you average it all out, Trump has retaken the lead in Pennsylvania for the first time since August or actually the end of August.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right now Trump's up by, you know, point two percent and that's with an outlier.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Could you talk about your relationship with Vice President Kamala Harris, what's that like, how did you first meet her: i met her with named fellows in the Aspen Institute.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She was a brand new prosecutor in San Francisco and I was a brand new state representative in suburban Philadelphia.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I got elected governor, she went to the U.S. Senate and then the vice presidency and we've maintained a close relationship and I think she's an extraordinary public servant.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's still in a dead heat with Donald Trump.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris went another way in her VP search, but the selection process solidified Shapiro's status as a star.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But were Harris to lose in November, how would that affect your timeline for thinking about your political future: i don't think about it that way.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I try and think about the job I have to do right before me, and that is to be the best governor I can be and politically to focus on helping Kamala Harris and Tim Valls be elected president and vice president.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Can you tell us a little bit more about that anticipation that it hasn't just been going on today: i mean, this has been going on since Trump said he was going back to Butler, Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Let's take a listen to part of Trump's speech at the RNC.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's according to the polling, now, the rally over the weekend was supposed to serve as a bit of a reset to Donald Trump's campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, Trump's having difficulty sticking to that message.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Obviously, Kamala Harris has managed to get under his skin and she's on his mind.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so take a look at how he decided to essentially go off message, go off that strategy and instead attack Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Two would believe this, 80 days from now we are going to defeat a communist known as Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's a communist.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Have you heard her laugh: that is the laugh of a crazy person.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I've been waiting for her to laugh because as soon as she laughs, the election's over.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I was listening to Trump, but I was watching his fans behind him and how distracted and uninterested they appear to be in what he was saying.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think that this is a huge misstep by Donald Trump because remember what voters found appealing about his message in 2016.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now here he is speaking out against those economic policies that his voters had previously found appealing, right: hey, don't scroll away.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's a lot to respond to there, so first off, he says, they say I'm rambling, but I don't ramble.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And then he goes on to ramble, i mean, and epically so, and then he did an ode to rambling.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He never folds them.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He always goes on and on and on, if you warn your own MAGA audience, then you're not doing it right.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And so he's not playing the greatest hits.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He used to do that, he'd say build the wall, lock her up, etc.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But his fans loved it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he would talk to Anna's point about economic populism.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He didn't mean it, but at least he was savvy enough to pretend to give you things, right: he's totally lost the thread on that because he just rambled his way out of what he was actually campaigning on.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So now that Kamala Harris has taken economically populist positions, Trump is defending corporations.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's defending his owners.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's a great way to lose, so he's just absolutely ruining his own campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he responds to every attack line.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's just not right, so like when they call- He's on the defense now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now the most important thing, Anna, is he's as usual, but now he can't contain himself.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's obsessed with himself.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So he's not talking about the people at all.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So first of all, why did you, no, but hey, the Rambler, why did you wind up giving five minutes of your speech to how hot Kamala Harris is: like, first of all, before you even got to how you're hotter, which is just insanity.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that's how Trump thinks, so that's why he thinks, I wonder if people are voting for Kamala Harris because she's hotter than me.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And guys, look, even if you're a MAGA, if you didn't think that he was a lunatic before, you really think that Donald Trump at 78 300 some odd pounds is better looking than Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Then when Trump says I'm more attractive, the crowd cheered not because of a conventional definition of beauty, but rather because he's white, they're deeply racist.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's talking about, oh, she's so attractive.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I just, I can't believe how much he has bungled his own campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like, he's totally lost, i really did think, okay, like they've been very strategic over at the Trump camp.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I remember being at the RNC and actually being impressed with how he was sticking to the script and how he was going along with the strategy and it was working.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now it's like, he's totally discombobulated over Kamala Harris being the Democratic nominee.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He should have expected it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And they should have strategized and he should stick to the strategy, but he can't help himself.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He's totally discombobulated, okay.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like anyone paying close attention to politics should have, including, and especially the Trump campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But it's especially weird when you consider what Trump had to say last week.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So let's go to that, yeah, yeah, i saw a picture of her on Time Magazine today.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She looks like the most beautiful actress ever to live.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And actually, she looked very much like a great first lady, Melania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She didn't look like Kamala, that's right.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But of course, she's a beautiful woman, so we'll leave it at that, right, so are you saying you're more attractive than your wife: no, I haven't thought of that with transitive property.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Of course, if you told him about the transitive property, he'd be like, I don't know in that one, so I don't know what you're talking about.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I don't know why he's imagining Kamala Harris as his wife in some weirdo bizarro thing that he shouldn't be talking about at all.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Why he's fixated on our looks, but most importantly, guys, his inability to pivot is actually kind of stunning.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But even so, he keeps using talking points about Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, so like he'll even go to like, oh, Biden was too old.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And at this point, you're 20 years older than Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Age and health in a 31 point lead, now he has a 30 point deficit.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So if you're a Republican, you want Trump to about age, but he's still talking about age because he can't get off his old talking points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That shows total incompetence, and you just don't, you're supposed to be attacking Kamala Harris on her policies like immigration cramps.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Because think about it, Kamala Harris is currently running on the things that she's gonna do if she gets elected and she's in the White House.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's in the White House now.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
You think she's heard this advice: i'm sure he's heard his advice.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The thing that I've always given Trump credit for is I felt that he understood marketing.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He understood how to sell it.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And right now he is flailing and his messaging is so disastrous.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Maybe he doesn't understand, yeah, I saw Bernie speak earlier today, and he's still totally the same Bernie as he was before.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so you know that I haven't thought that Trump had an age problem because I'm like, look, if you think the things he's saying is crazy, he's always been crazy, right: and he's always been unintelligent, etc.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Brand new polling is showing that Donald Trump is surging in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We have to talk about the 2024 presidential election because Donald Trump is surging in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
With some the polls showing Trump's actually having a small lead.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Hell, Marist, yes, the same Marist that back in 2020 was claiming Trump was down everywhere.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He was gonna lose in a landslide.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And, in fact, I believe if you look at the internals, it's actually a Trump lead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yes, the same pollster that back in 2020 claimed Trump is gonna win Wisconsin by 17 points.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I'm not trying to say that's for sure gonna happen, but these pollsters have track records of understating Trump by a couple points at the bare minimum.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But when you go to the RCP average, you would think, oh, with Trump being tied with Marist, tied in the Washington Post, up with Emerson, up with insider advantage, you would think the RCP average would be Trump plus one or even like Trump plus 0.5.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
There were four pollsters that dropped Harris leads.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, seriously, Quinnipiac, how do you find Harris plus five in Pennsylvania, how, how is that even possible: i mean, I'd be dead serious.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So you could argue, well, maybe within the margin of error, which is four points, it could be a Trump lead.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But what's the excuse for Quinnipiac or even The New York Times, i mean, how do you find Harris plus four, Harris plus five right now: would everyone else, even the Washington Post or even Franklin and Marshall, they're finding the race, you know, within the margin of error.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What a pile of crap, but either way, there's four other polls that dropped that found Trump either slightly ahead or in a statistical tie with Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Harris plus four in Pennsylvania doing three points better than Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Hell, Trump was not even leading in virtually any poll.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is doing better in every single poll in the RCP average compared to 2020, not just one of them, not just two of them.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Right now they have Trump winning.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
What does that tell you: that tells you that every poll is suggesting Trump is doing better right now than he did back in 2020.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Now, does this mean that he's going to do four to five points better in Pennsylvania: i'm not saying that, but I find it fascinating that every poll is showing Trump doing at the bare minimum three points better in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Again, we got to see what happens, i'm not saying that Trump's going to win Pennsylvania by four points or whatever, but you cannot tell me that this is a fluke that nearly every poll.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
She is doing worse than Biden.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"We got to see what happens, it could be a fluke, could be, you know, oh, actually the polls overstate Trump this time.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I guess that's possible, but the same polls that found Trump down by 15 points back in 2020, they now found Trump down by only three or four.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, like you could argue it could go to Harris fine, but a Harris plus five poll is not it's not feasible right now.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"That's not going to happen, she's not going to win Pennsylvania by four or five points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris and Trump are not too far behind there.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is at 51 percent unfavorable.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump is at 52 percent.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What I will say is we're seeing a lot of support right now for President Trump on college campuses, particularly among the young men.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Did you see last the last presidential debate: trump was horrid.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So Donald Trump constantly on Fox News doing the birtherism thing.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Maybe he's from Africa.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He never probably necessarily said he's Muslim, but that was the whole implication of the entire birtherism thing.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so Fox News fuels this birtherism, which then fuels Trump and now is utterly appalled that they're losing control of it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Then you have the Tea Party losing control to the Trump movement.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now all of a sudden Trump has endorsed Dr. Oz and you've got somebody who's taking the birtherism and the and the and Obama's a Muslim and all this crazy stuff, which YouTube monitors.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's so interesting that Trump endorsed Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's obvious, but Dr. Oz is sort of problematic from a like if you are a hardcore Trump voter, Dr. Oz is not somebody that you want to hold your nose and have to vote for.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump's argument is that Dr. Oz is who can win the general election.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And so Trump is using this line that Dr. Oz is who can win the general election.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So is this a win for Trumpism and a loss for Trump if she wins.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yeah this is a this is a big one, trump has backed Perdue and then Mike Pence has actually elevated his involvement on the Kemp side which is really interesting.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It doesn't, very true because the way he approached things, we had our friends respecting us, enemies fearing us, but even people like Putin and G, you think a little rocket man in North Korea was actually brought President Trump over the 38th parallel, the first president to do that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump was heavily criticized by conducting diplomacy with Vladimir Putin and little rocket man in North Korea.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But President Trump conducting diplomacy with our enemies, I think was very was very important for for our country to maintain our status as the world's number one superpower.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's what President Trump did.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And ultimately, that's not what Biden has done, and moreover, that's not what any Republican or Democrat has done before President Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Donald Trump offers a a different approach.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Both Trump and Harris taking their campaign campaigns through Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"One, I think that both both of the Harris campaigns and the Trump campaigns.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If she loses Pennsylvania, she can't win.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It is true that they're tied in the state right now, but that means that Donald Trump is actually winning because he typically underperforms in public opinion polls and does better on election day.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Don't don't mistake him, i apologize if I wasn't clear.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's a must have for Kamala Harris, but if you look at other states that are swing states like Arizona, like Georgia, like Nevada, you know Trump is actually doing better and overperforming in all those states than he did in 2020 and in 2016.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So Trump has got to be feeling pretty good right now.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if you look at the polling that I'm seeing the the bounce that Kamala Harris got leading up to the convention, that's already starting to diminish as people begin to wonder why she is not being more specific about public policy positions or she has continued to be wishy washy fracking being the most vivid example.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So are Democrats right to question Trump's sincerity on this issue: well, look, it is a campaign season, so every statement is going to be questioned for sincerity.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump actually has been quite supportive of IVF.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"It's a question of whether he may say now that that's what he wants, but could something like that work its way through one or both houses of Congress: i think that's that remains to be seen.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's going to get attacked for it from both the left and the right.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"On Fox News, he largely focused on immigration and the border.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump also taped a town hall with the Spanish-language network Univision in Miami.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And he spoke to those who may still be undecided, vice President Harris is hoping to win over Republicans on the fence still about whether or not to support Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Today, she held a rally in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a little bit north of Philadelphia, where she highlighted Republicans now supporting her and also sat down for an interview with Fox News.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Vice President Harris remarked on stage today that she would be pretty surprised in any other election year to have this group show up on stage with her in the closing lap of a presidential campaign.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Now, a lot of these Republicans don't mind his economic policies, maybe not as protectionist view on trade, but they like low taxes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What's the state of the campaign there based on your reporting as best you can tell: there's a real sense inside the Harris campaign that in Western Pennsylvania, in exurban, in rural areas, the Trump campaign as it did in 2016 and 2020 is going to do pretty well.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Tomorrow night's presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will take place in Philadelphia, in a state that could prove to be the deciding factor in the race for the White House.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Drive down a gravel road just past a cornfield and you will find how Vice President Harris plans to win the election.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Hello, my name is Vanessa and I'm a volunteer with the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"There's a lot of enthusiasm since Kamala Harris got into the race for you know getting out and voting for her, but I think people are very you know concerned it's such a close race.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For Rodney Nace, it's about Trump's track record.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like her, he opposes abortion bans.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I am voting for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I generally just do not think that Mr. Trump could, uh, could lead the country at all.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What don't you like about Trump, where do I start: like Dolores Cole, we met her at that Republican event.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They just worship their God who is Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And that's it, he can do no wrong even though he does.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
So they don't think for themselves.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I'm thinking for myself and for my country.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"At the helm, lifelong Republican Al Schmidt stood up to former President Trump and refused to join attempts to overturn his loss four years ago.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The night before, former President Trump held a rally just a few hours away, where he stoked fears about voting in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He seems to be saying that there is cheating going on with mail-in ballots here.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And you can see that, you know, former President Trump's got the rallies and he's got the microphone and he's got the audiences and he can spread his message to thousands if not millions of people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Donald Trump won in 2016 by about 44,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Donald Trump lost in 2020 by about 80,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I understand that he's a sore loser.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I understand that he wished he would have won in 2020.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Before President Trump is refusing to commit to accepting the results if he loses, if he does refuse, what happens here in Pennsylvania, what does that look like: i think it can look, unfortunately, like what it looked like in 2020 with violence in our communities, with threats to public officials, good public officials like Al Schmidt and the Republican and Democratic clerks of elections.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Hours after the polls closed, then President Trump demanded the counting stop.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Former President Trump went after Al Schmidt by name on Twitter, and violent threats from Trump supporters followed.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Can we keep hearing about how this is a super tight race: well, according to 538 National Polling, Donald Trump is leading Kamala Harris as the preferred president, 48% to 46%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And you know, there may be an event and Kamala Harris gets a bump and another assassination attempt, Donald Trump gets a bump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, it's interesting, a Quinnipiac University national poll showed that Donald Trump is just ahead at 48% to Kamala Harris is 47%.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But then CNN's latest findings showed that Kamala Harris is at 48% and Mr. Trump is at 47%.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, in the sense that given the way our electoral college is structured, Kamala Harris needs to be at least three and a half to four percentage points ahead of Donald Trump because of the popular vote, she gets a lot of extra votes, popular votes in California and Illinois and New York, large states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Okay, look, an NBC national news poll put Kamala Harris's favorability jumping 16 points since July.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yes, that's massive, what do you put that down to: well, you know, the book on Kamala Harris was that she was a do-nothing vice president, that the White House itself didn't trust her, and that she was harsh.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But, you know, once she became the candidate, there was a change in the conversation.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's very good out there, plus, let's admit it, she's gotten a bit of a nice honeymoon from the press.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Oh, she absolutely has, i think the mainstream left-wing media has a fair bit to do with that.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Four had Harris up, two had Trump up, six had a tie.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So the way I kind of look at these things with, you know, 40 days or so to go is who would I rather be: and I'd rather be Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I think she is not only doing a great job of kind of getting the band back together, right, getting the coalition back together.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But she's also playing on his side of the field.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's in places like Beaver County.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Her campaign's been in rural communities.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The point is she's playing on their side of the field.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think she's got some momentum.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I think she's playing on his side of the field.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Can Harris replicate that margin in Montgomery, Chester, Bucks and Delaware: yeah, I mean, I think she's got the momentum to be able to do that.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And of course, Donald Trump is the one that ripped away that freedom for millions of women here in Pennsylvania and across the country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But, you know, I'm hearing from some Democrats, it's still hard to get a turnout and Trump is cutting into some of that black vote in the city.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And I think you're going to see Kamala Harris do incredibly well in the city and boost turnout in the city.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And I think you're also going to see her be able to play in the Philly burbs in a really meaningful way.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You mentioned she had been in some of those red counties, those working class areas.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Republicans certainly say this, that she's kind of right.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's running behind where Biden was in the Northeast and Western Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I mean, I'm not sure if she's if the Republicans rhetoric is right and she's really behind.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And yet he went to the floor of the House of Representatives to say, wait, my election counts.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Having Trump, former President Trump, back in president, having his hands on the buttons of controls makes me really nervous.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump flags are visible throughout the county, and in downtown Lancaster, Natasha Collins told us she's no fan of Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump was in Pennsylvania a few weeks ago for a fundraiser outside Philadelphia and to hold one of his traditional rallies in Lehigh County, an area Biden won by seven points in 2020.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Trump campaign told Spectrum News it has paid staffers and volunteer-powered field programs in every battleground state, including Pennsylvania, and they are expanding daily.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"New reports, meanwhile, say that Harris' team is getting nervous over Trump's gains just 18 days out from the election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kaylee, just, Deakin's making a very good point here because Kamala Harris did come out in 2019 for these EV mandates.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now she's backing off on them a little bit like she's doing with fracking because she wants to get elected.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
But that's so short sighted and they're not looking at the long term and what will come because with Kamala Harris presidency will come these EV mandates and it will be a long term demise of the auto industry.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This is the average, and what you see nationally is Kamala Harris with a 1.6 percent lead.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So when the Democrat candidate starts professing support for Trump, what does that say: well, he's first of all, Bob Casey is a great American supporting Kamala Harris.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, and listen, I was on I was on the air here saying some of the Trump tariffs were good.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris has been part of a team that has made it the largest increase in oil production, natural gas production in American history.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And this was something that was not at least she wanted to ban fracking and then pivoted.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Oh, wait, because she has to win votes.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Look at this, trump is winning in every single swing state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It's in the margin of error.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, and the trend, of course, she at one point was ahead in a majority of those states, again, but within the margin of error.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So we've seen a trend from the beginning of Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But Harris has not performed, people were waiting, including after the debate, thinking, well, at the debate, we'll get some specifics.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Did not happen, even in the dinner last night with the video, she could have been funny herself.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"They also got nervous, too, when she failed to get some of the key endorsements from some of the organized unions that Joe Biden got before.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I'm pretty sure if Trump were sitting here now, he would say, you can take those endorsements.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Inside team Harris's unusual levels of finger pointing, which is very typical for these people, where there's no leadership at all.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now the Harris campaign provided a list of Politico of several examples of surrogate events aimed at engaging voters of color.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that is just a bad phrasing, right, i think that's why it's, what does Trump use, he uses Latinos poor Trump, right, it's not with Harris because it's con, right: and in English, con is not a good word.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But of course, Latinos con Harris, the whole thing is just a disaster.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now he said Democrats complaints are a reflection of their anxiety over a tight race.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Everybody's very nervous, he said.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But let's see where this goes, because Kamala gets asked about reparations.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Let's see what she says, valuation of the lack of resources and current living conditions in black communities nationwide.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And it's not good news for Kamala Harris and the Democrats.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"A recent Emerson College poll from October 1, 2024, had both candidates at 48 percent, while a Bloomberg-Sawanar Morning Consult poll found Harris ahead by 5 points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is proving to be a formidable opponent.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In fact, she's managed to close the gap among white voters, trailing Trump by only three points nationally compared to Biden's larger 12-point gap in 2020.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The question still stands, will this early voting surge be enough for Harris to secure a win in Pennsylvania: we can't talk about Pennsylvania without discussing its significance in the electoral landscape.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"On the flip side, Trump has a 92.4% chance of winning the election if he flips Pennsylvania back to red.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"However, Trump's appeal to this demographic isn't the slam dunk it used to be.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris, in her bid to win over white voters, has worked tirelessly to reshape her image and bridge the gap on key issues, particularly fracking.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
He even went as far as accusing her of being against fracking for 12 years during their recent debate in Philadelphia.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris, however, has since walked back her earlier stance, clarifying that she now supports the continued use of natural gas, particularly in light of the Inflation Reduction Act, which opens new gas leases.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Despite Trump's attacks, Harris's position on fracking may not be as detrimental as it once seemed.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Her firm stance during the debate, combined with her messaging on economic stability and climate change, is resonating with voters concerned about job security and the future of clean energy in Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She also held a bus tour through western Pennsylvania, even making a snack stop at a local Sheetz gas station.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump spends his summers in nearby New Jersey, and Harris lives in Washington, D.C., making Pennsylvania just a short flight away for both campaigns.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's campaign has banked on this very strategy, hoping that a late surge at the polls could offset Harris' early voting advantage.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In 2020, Trump performed well with voters who showed up on election day, and he's hoping for a repeat performance this year.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But Trump's support base is still strong in Pennsylvania's rural counties, and it's this electorate that will likely make the difference come election day.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris has been working hard to inspire voters and avoid the enthusiasm deficit that plagued Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Her multiple trips to Pennsylvania, particularly to Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, are designed to keep Democratic voters energized.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Trump's rallies in the state have continued to draw large crowds, maintaining his base's enthusiasm.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The question is whether that enthusiasm will translate into enough votes to offset Harris' early voting lead.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If the trend holds and Harris secures Pennsylvania along with Michigan and Wisconsin, she is all but guaranteed to win the presidency.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump's path to victory also runs through the Keystone State.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"While he's polling ahead in North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia, he still needs to flip at least one of the blue-wall states to secure the presidency.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trump and his allies have reserved over $64 million worth of TV ads in Pennsylvania between September 10th and Election Day.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That's more than what they've planned for swing states like Arizona, North Carolina, and Wisconsin combined.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris's team, however, is outspending Trump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The Harris campaign and its allies have locked in $77 million in ads for Pennsylvania, showcasing just how important the state is to both sides.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The early voting trends in favor of the Democrats are promising for Kamala Harris, but nothing is set in stone.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In a hypothetical two-way race between Harris and Trump, Harris has a slight lead over Trump at 51 to 46 percent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In August, Harris received 50 percent of the vote and Trump received 47 percent.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And looking at the enthusiasm, 70 percent of likely voters supporting Harris are enthusiastic about supporting Harris, which is up from 66 percent in August.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
73 percent of likely voters supporting Trump say they are very enthusiastic about supporting him compared to 70 percent in August.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Compared to our August, when 46 percent had her favorable, 48 percent unfavorable, that is now flipped.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is now more viewed positively according to this poll in Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Favorability, the catch-all for what voters think about the candidates from policy to personality to promise, tips Harris way since we last polled Pennsylvanians.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump was up 0.2 percent before this poll came out.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump had 48 percent, Harris at 47.8.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump is down to 47.7, pennsylvania has been back and forth for the last few days, a few weeks now.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Trafalgar had Trump up two.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
USA Today and Suffolk had Harris up three.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Insider Advantage had Trump plus two.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And to be quite honest, I'm not really too sure what to make of this poll because I don't think there's, I don't think Kamala Harris, even if she has a good night on election night, I don't think she's going to win Pennsylvania by five percentage points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think Trump will outperform 46 in Pennsylvania.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I could certainly see Harris, if she wins the state, getting 50 to 51 percent of the vote though.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I question Trump's support at 46 percent.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And now Harris is leading Trump here by five points when every other poll except for one has the race at three, at two points or under, aside from USA Today, which had it at three points or under and a 4.4 percent margin of error.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I think it's certainly possible for Quinnipiac in this poll to not be accurately representing Trump's stage of support in Pennsylvania, while at the same time acknowledging the fact that Harrison may have a slight lead in the state.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I think Harris is probably up in Pennsylvania, like one to two percentage points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"On the pathway to 270, Harris is 226.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Because even if Trump were to win North Carolina and Georgia and Arizona, three states he's currently leading in the polls right now, if Harris wins Wisconsin and Michigan and Nevada, three states she's leading in right now, she would win the presidency.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Okay, Trump wins Michigan then and loses Nevada.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But Trump is polling better in Pennsylvania than he is in Michigan.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So the odds of that happening are pretty low, is it possible Trump can win Wisconsin and win the election and lose Pennsylvania: this is probably more probable than winning Michigan.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
It is nonetheless good news for Harris that she is a lead in this state.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"all right so Kamala Harris had a sit-down interview with a local station and they asked her about her economic plan and she basically repeated the same thing that she always says the interviewer wanted to get some details on her economic plan so she says that well I'm from the middle class and blah blah blah blah opportunity economy blah blah blah blah I was gonna actually react to it right here but I'm just so sick of her saying the exact same thing it's ridiculous it's pretty pathetic at this point she's gonna give $25,000 new homeowner home buyers which makes those first of all where's this tax credit gonna come from where are they gonna find the money for all this and even if they do okay let's say you give away $25,000 to somebody who's looking to buy a home or whatever okay well then if you're selling a home if you're selling a home naturally you're gonna raise the price of the home by $25,000 because you now know that this person has access to $25,000 from the government anyway she says she wants to build 3,000 new homes or apartments or whatever okay yeah how are you actually gonna do that you know it's just really embarrassing at this point she can only perform on a really controlled environments which made the debate really frustrating obviously the moderators supported her as much as they could attack Trump as much as they could Trump's still fail to just expose her but I'm not gonna dwell on that we still have a little more time to go in this campaign and it's pretty obvious that she has nothing new to offer as far as a plan she just repeats what she's been coached to say and that's all we're really dealing with here so she gets into the White House who's actually gonna be running the show seriously but she have any ability to actually do this job she talked about her economic plan she has no experience whatsoever running large organizations companies corporations or anything governments even she was an attorney attorney general of California prosecutor in San Francisco she became a US senator but I mean where's a real practical experience actually running large organizations the answer is she doesn't have any and she doesn't really need any because she's not gonna be running this show so there you go thanks for watching thanks for listening and don't forget the future belongs those who bear for today and speaking of the election there has been some good news as far as the election is not all gloom and doom as far as World War three and all this other stuff there are has been a ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and it's really good news for Trump essentially they're saying that mail-in ballots without correct dates will not be counted so you can't be submitting mail-in ballots without the right dates so some good news right there they have to have some type of standards put in place and let me say this one more time about elections you cannot have a situation where it takes three days to count the damn votes the system loses all credibility system loses all credibility when that happens and going back to the world situation with Ukraine the problem with the Ukraine using long range missiles given to them by the US and UK is that they need satellite satellite technology they don't have the technology and expertise actually utilize these long range missiles without direct involvement from NATO that means the United States means to UK and if they're in a situation where they're they get to okay from the United States and UK NATO to actually use these long range missiles in Russia Russia's there Putin is saying that it means that Russia is gonna be a war with NATO now what does that really mean does that mean they're gonna the Russian Navy is gonna take on the US Navy the US has the best Navy I say that much it doesn't mean nuclear weapons is I mean tactical weapon tactical tactical nukes been used throughout Europe what does that really mean that's the question I do know this Putin has set red lines before and they don't has crossed them over and over again so at this point does anybody in London and Washington really take Russia seriously do they take Putin seriously now right now the Washington is sort of pulling back with this idea we've seen this in the past where somebody in Europe or suggest a let's do cross this red line and Washington says well I don't know about that but then later on it come around say well okay go ahead and do it we've seen this pattern play out over and over and now Putin is saying that a if you cross this red line we know we will consider NATO to be directly involved in this conflict what is it what what what exactly will be the consequences what is Russia gonna do I mean that's the big question there's talk that maybe Russia can do a demonstration of a nuclear test they haven't done that since 1990 I don't think that's gonna be effective in deterring NATO because at this point a lot of people in NATO believe that a Russia is gonna do anything all right this is to say the world we have a presidential election where it's pretty obvious that we're in big trouble we're in very big trouble that's if we don't end up in World War three before then so do your best to take care of yourself take care of your family I wanted to range today enjoy that and I'll forget the future belongs to those who prepare for today",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Over the weekend, the Trump campaign claimed it was recently hacked, and it's now blaming Iran for the data breach.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, a New York Times-Siana poll now shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in three key battleground states.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"She has a four-point lead in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
All of those were states that she stopped in last week on her battleground tour with Governor Tim Walz.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The Trump campaign, let's start there, claims that it was hacked.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The campaign has not provided any other specifics other than to say it believes it was hacked by some Iranian entity and cited a report that was released on Friday by Microsoft warning that Iranian-backed entities or Iranian-based entities had been doing or attempting to do these kinds of things.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And Ed, over the weekend, Trump claimed photos of crowds at Harris's rally were AI generated.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Do we have a sense of the strategy here, what is Trump hoping to achieve: it's unclear, Chanel.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What he's trying to do, specifically in this case, unclear, but we know he's been trying to sow doubts and suggest that he's not getting proper attention or credit for the size and popularity of his campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Look, for years, since he first ran in 2015, 2016, we've reported on the massive crowds that show up for his events that were not reporting it these days.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Might have to do in part because he's not holding events that size.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But for example, we know that on the day he was nearly killed in Butler, Pennsylvania, there were 15,000 people there.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That number's been reported, so that was more than some of the crowds that Harris had in recent weeks, or in recent days.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But he hasn't had events that big in recent weeks, so there'd be no way to mention it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But again, it seems to me mostly a cry for attention and an attempt to remind people that he, too, has been able to draw crowds like that in the past and very well may be able to in the future.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Good to have that context there, at Harris's rally this weekend, she said her administration would get rid of attacks on tips for service workers.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And then we saw Trump claiming that Harris had copied the idea from him.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Well, what did Kamala Harris do Saturday night in Las Vegas, but say I support ending taxes on tips, as well as raising the minimum wage for workers who have those lower minimum wage levels of roughly $2 in change in some states, definitely below the federal average, because your employer is presuming that you're going to make a lot more in terms of tipped wages as well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So what she's arguing is raise the minimum wage, then allow people to get taxes or get their tips and not tax that taxable income or that tipable income.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So there's real potential savings there, but the difference in why the culinary workers union is okay with what Harris is proposing is because she's saying, let's make this tip thing part of a plan that would also raise the minimum wage.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Is Trump correct to say that she's copying her to some extent: sure.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But the Harris campaign can turn around and say, yeah, but you've said nothing about raising the minimum wage.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
New Hampshire's primary results do appear to have cemented Donald Trump's grip on the Republican Party.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There's no changing their minds, but more than 72 million Americans voted for Donald Trump in 2020, and it is important to understand why.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Tell me about yourself and how you came to like Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And I believe that Donald Trump, for eight years, he's been attacked.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And if he's elected president, I believe that he'll make policy change.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He'll secure our borders.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You heard some of his opponents during the last few months say the wall wasn't finished.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Does any of that reverberate with you, and you wonder, can he get it done if he wins a second term: he can get it done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, he's not a career politician.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He is a, you know, businessman.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And you might not always like the way he says things, but he gets things done.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
I heard Trump give me his inaugural speech.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He wants to make it great.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He's not with the status quo.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And he's actually for the people.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so I feel as though Donald Trump, he's not the silver bullet that's going to save the country.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But voting for that man and having him elected back into office is the step that we need to take to fix, to make this country great.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And you think Donald Trump can change that, and do you blame Joe Biden for that: well, it's, I don't blame Joe Biden.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"A lifelong Republican, Jim Vinop, says Trump hasn't let him down.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Like other politicians, he supported in the past.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"When he came down the escalator, I thought, oh, this is crazy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You know, this guy, he'll never get anywhere.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Well, as things went on, I became a die-hard Donald Trump fan.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump does what he says.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
The only reason he didn't get a lot more done is because they gave him grief every minute of every day.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"What was it and what is it about him, has he made mistakes: oh, my goodness.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yes, but I do believe that his heart's in the right place for me.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You heard from other, and you said that and he hugged the American flag.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But you've heard what he said through those people about the military, about wounded veterans, about Normandy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"That doesn't bother you, yeah, things he has said bother me.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Am I giving him carte blanche, he can do anything he wants: no, no, absolutely not.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, I've said many times, geez, I wish he hadn't said that.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You said something that interested me, which is Donald Trump cares about me.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Not only do these voters dismiss Trump's many legal challenges.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
You have certainly heard people who do not like Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Today is Saturday, August 10th, 2024, and this morning, the New York Times and Sienna College released an A plus poll across three battleground states, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, showing Kamala Harris with a four-point lead in every single battleground state.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Kamala Harris making these massive improvements relative to President Biden have only continued and the momentum has been built and it's gaining in a very good way for the Democratic Party.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Kamala Harris now leading by four points in these three states shows a shift not only from what we saw with Biden, but potentially from the 2020 presidential election where Donald Trump lost these states, but not by four points in any of them.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that isn't what's happening here with Kamala Harris, but it certainly is really good news that the Harris campaign is up four points in these states that truly are going to be the most important.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
There's enough electoral map math there that makes it so that these states could truly be the ones that hand Kamala Harris the presidency.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Now Kamala Harris at 50 in all these states is also a good indicator beyond that point.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It means that you're already at a majority and that people just moving over narrowly between now and the election can put you over that majority denying any chance that Donald Trump would win by a plurality, vote splitting, whatever it might be.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"These are defining numbers that are very, very positive for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But absolutely explains why people, you know, choosing someone like Tim Walz was a good choice, why Kamala Harris being the replacement nominee for it was a good choice.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So before this poll was released, Harris was up by one point on average.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"0.9 percent lead for Kamala Harris, that will undoubtedly jump up.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And a lot of this is because the fact that the American public now views Kamala Harris in a very different way than they did before she was the nominee for president.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Right now, the unfavorability numbers are just 5.6 percent higher than the favorability rating numbers, which is a massive, massive turnaround for Kamala Harris from where she was before.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"For the entire duration of the presidency, with the exception of this honeymoon period, from January 2021 to July 2021, Kamala Harris has been disapproved of quite tremendously.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It got really bad around the time of the Afghanistan withdrawal, but even before then, she started to see a dip in approval, and she was unfavored pretty much nationwide.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
More and more people started to dislike Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"The majority of the nation had an unfavorable view of Kamala Harris, roughly a third of the nation, just a third, had a favorable view of Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And so to see this massive, massive overturn from where it was before, again, day of the dropout, we saw Kamala Harris down nearly 20 points nationally.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Today, she is down just five.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And 43 percent of the nation has a favorable view of Kamala Harris that is the highest it has been since July 20th of 2021.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So massive, massive gains here, sorry, July 2021, not July 20th, massive gains for Kamala Harris and overall approval, and so being down again, 5.6 percent also means that the unfavorability rating has now dropped below 50 percent, meaning the majority of the nation no longer views Kamala Harris as unfavorable.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that is a good thing, and she outflinks Donald Trump when you look at levels of favorability rating.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
What you're seeing here is that 8.2 percent more people have an unfair 8.2 percent delta between the unfavorable and favorable numbers for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"You can see when it was a Biden versus Trump rematch, we saw that Biden was down nationally, two, three points on average.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Today, she's up by two.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Back in 2020, her favorability rating numbers were not good after that 2019 and 2020 presidential bid.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"It did not look good for her favorabilities, for how people perceived her X, Y and Z until she was actually put in the position where the national spotlight was on her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She spoke directly to the people.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She had the ability to reshape the way that Americans viewed her.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And it worked, and by the time we reached the election, she became someone with a positive approval rating.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Unlike Mike Pence, unlike Donald Trump, she was able to turn it around.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And based on what we are seeing right now, it is very possible that she is turning it around as well.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And no point in time did Donald Trump really ever see a position where he was dropping so rapidly in election odds, dropping so rapidly in terms of overall performance, in terms of expectation, in terms of fundraising.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, Donald Trump had a very, very, very large amount of momentum going into Joe Biden dropping out.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"There was so much around him, the assassination attempt, JD Vance announcement, the RNC had passed.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And so it looked like Donald Trump was unbeatable that this election would be one and done.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Called on election night, no consideration in these battleground states, Trump was in it to win it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And since then, it has been the worst three weeks of Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so from then on, we had an election prediction, I released it right after the debate, showing Donald Trump with a 312 electoral vote victory over Joe Biden, a massive, massive gain compared to where it would be in 2020, and even a better performance than he had against Hillary Clinton.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And so really, 52 to 46 is already a game for Kamala Harris, well, yesterday, three point gain in terms of odds and chances based on the betting markets.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This is where favorability ratings can really, really help because Kamala Harris can, you know, talk to voters and say, this is who I am, this is my story, you may not have known me in the same way as I was as the vice presidential contender, now that I'm the forefront of this ticket, here's who I am, and here's my story.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And that's actually good news for Donald Trump's campaign, because it means this election is by no means over.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But in the grand scheme of things, this could be one of the most defining moments for the Kamala Harris campaign and the Donald Trump campaign.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She's doing really well, hitting it out of the park.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's doing really well in terms of who's coming to her rallies.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's doing really well in terms of endorsements from organizations that never endorse presidential candidates.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's doing really well in polling data relative to Biden and arguably just relative to general Democratic performance.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is in a strong position for this election.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She could still lose, but she will still be in a position.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"But right now she is still very much in a position she was in yesterday and the day before, which is being on track for victory and on track for an Electoral College win that could be even bigger than Joe Biden's that's yet to be seen, but not at all out of the realm of possibility 10 weeks ago that was never even in the books.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The white house says president Biden or the Trump hat for unity.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"The Trump hat, but here's the full video, uh, and the full context.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, pause, okay, so now, once you see that, I think it's clear, like secretly right now, Kamala Harris is screaming after her fifth glass of Chardonnay into a pillow right now, screaming at the top of her lungs.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Okay, and, and, and you hear all these rumors and, and, and I think back to when Trump, and we'll put this in the, in the post and it'll look really cool.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Right, yeah, and everybody was like, Oh, well now you see this image and you're like, Oh, maybe he does hate Kamala.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He hates her.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
He can't stand her.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Hey Joe, how many times have you seen Jill Biden give a speech about Kamala: no, never.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"President Trump is still ahead in Arizona, but that lead is narrow.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Donald Trump had a four point lead there.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Now it's basically tied Harris with a small margin there.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Those are voters that Donald Trump hasn't had great success with.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So you're going to see the Harris campaign, the Trump campaign focusing on different areas.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The Harris campaign will certainly be trying to turn out votes in Milwaukee and Dane County around Madison.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
The Trump campaign is going to try and get those rural voters that he has such tremendous success without.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Again, some areas where perhaps Donald Trump has shown some weakness with traditional voters as Republican voters rather, as sort of that Republican coalition is being reimagined and repurposed by the Trump campaign.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In the Western part of the state, you'll see in Grand Rapids is an area where Republicans generally do well, but Trump will spend a lot of time simply because it's an area where those voters are a little less sure about him.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And again, you'll see the Harris campaign certainly going into some of the larger areas around Detroit to turn out their base vote.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Trump had a seven point polling lead in our average and now it's a tie.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Their clearest path to 270 is to flip Georgia and Pennsylvania.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So it's just two states, they essentially have to win to do this.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
They had a seven point polling lead for Trump going into the switch and now it's down.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It's still one of the states that he leads in but it's down to two and a half points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So again, that's a state where you're gonna see the Harris campaign put a lot of effort into playing defense.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"If they can prevent the Trump campaign from flipping Georgia and hold on to their blue wall in the upper Midwest, that's gonna be the ball game for them.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has picked a governor as her running mate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Vice President Kamala Harris has picked Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris is prepared for the upcoming presidential debate between stops inside stores in Pittsburgh.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She was seen talking, even hugging, a lot of voters there inside those stores.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She's there because she wants to boost her platform of small businesses.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Trump, meanwhile, you can see him right here behind us, behind bulletproof glass.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"He put his money on Wisconsin, rallying voters there.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris holds a tight lead in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"While voters felt Trump is the better candidate to help with the economy and inflation, a majority felt Harris is more likely to help the middle class.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And CBS News campaign reporter Jake Rosen talking team Trump in just a minute.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
How is Harris getting ready for this: this is a crucial state in Pennsylvania for the November election.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"All right, so it seems we're at the point in time right now where every move by every candidate really reveals some strategy after the debate, where's Kamala Harris headed: she is going to North Carolina for a handful of rallies on Thursday.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And then she is coming back here to Pennsylvania, but on the other side of the state, the eastern part of the state near Scranton Wilkes Bar on Friday, showing that they are ready to get back onto the trail after this debate tomorrow.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Yeah, we're showing video just a second ago of Harris having a walk with Doug M. Hoff, asked if she's ready, she said, I'm ready.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"This is part of a swing that Donald Trump did last week, including speaking to law enforcement members and doing a town hall with Sean Hannity in Pennsylvania, a state that the Trump campaign has repeatedly made an emphasis and focus as they head towards November.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"All right, Jake, so in recent hours, Trump's been dealing with more questions, more talk and discussion over his cognitive health, comes as his campaign is really ramping up efforts to appeal to younger male voters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In addition to some live streams down at Mar-a-Lago, including one person who brought a Cybertruck with that infamous fight, fight, fight picture on it from the Butler assassination attempt, this is just one angle that the Trump campaign has done to get Donald Trump out there to younger voters who they believe can turn out for them.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But this also comes as our CBS News polling from this weekend shows that the script has been flipped in the last couple weeks since the last debate that Donald Trump is now seen as in the red, no pun intended, on having a weakness among voters about who voters see as the most competent and able-bodied to be president.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"So we'll see exactly how those fears play out, but this engagement with younger voters and specifically going to events like the UFC and things like that is really what the Trump campaign wants to have their posture be going forward for these younger voters to dissuade them of some of those concerns.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Let's start with you How do you grade the speech, i gave her a B plus B B plus a B plus a a C C so mostly A's and B's with one C I'm gonna ask you why you made the decision you made first I'll be start with Scott who is the president of the UAW local here in the Lehigh Valley Scott What what grade did you give it again: i'll be plus I'll come I gave her the high grade because I thought she looked very confident.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I Liked how she spoke from her heart.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"I liked her message of unity and the division that we have in America I like her fight for the middle class and families The reason I didn't give her her an A was I thought She needed to go into a little more detail on some of her plans How she would you know do some of the things that she envisioned: okay, Lindsay, you're in sales You're the person who wasn't sure she was gonna vote for anybody because you don't like either these two candidates I'll ask you more about that in a minute.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"He's a little bit more aggressive She's aggressive in her way, but I think she'll be aggressive in the next term So Trump over Harris for you Harris over Trump for most of you what I will tell you 75 days now until election day.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"But in our talks with the Trump campaign, they say there's really only one person who knows.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And that's Mr. Trump himself.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Kamala Harris is fantastic.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Obviously, I love her.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You know, I'm not saying that Trump is definitely going to fix that, but he's definitely the right person right now as you know, for the people, we, the people, what was the new democracies, what the, um, I'm sorry, the Constitution, who's, who's what was written off of, you know, so it's all about us, the people.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And as long as, you know, you take care of us, you, this guy, you know, his kids take care of the future generations, then this is what is going to help to create the economy, better jobs, open up everything else, you know, and that's, that's really, that's all I have to say about it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"No problem, thank you, and can I get, can I get him to walk me down: yeah.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Jay, he just wants to, he wants to do it.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"I mean, he just fits Trump.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Women for Trump, Trump girls, they're hardcore supporters.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
They love our president and they always show up for him.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And this just shows you that Trump is opening up the economy and helping jobs, man, all time high when he was in office.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
And Kamala is not the answer.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"She is definitely, she's had four years to do it.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
She didn't do anything.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"God bless you, my friend, there's a lot of policies out there from Kamala Harris that she says that she is going to boost the economy with, boost the country with, stimulate people's bank accounts with.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"One of them is she's going to give 25,000 to new homeowners.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Meanwhile, Trump is targeting rural and suburban areas, where his messages on law and order resonate strongly.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Trump's support for fossil fuels and deregulation has strong appeal in energy-producing regions, while Harris's focus on transitioning to renewable energy is gaining traction in urban areas concerned with climate change.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Thank you, starting with the eighth poll, conducted by the Bullfinch Group from August 8 to 11 with 1,500 registered voters, Harris received 45% of the vote, while Trump received 41%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
Harris leads this poll by four points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Moving forward to the seventh poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University from August 8 to 12, with 1,738 likely voters, Harris received 48% of the vote, while Trump received 45%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Harris beats Trump in this poll by three points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Moving to the sixth poll, also conducted by Quinnipiac University on the same dates with a different 1,738 likely voters, Harris received 50% of the vote, while Trump received 47%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Again, Harris leads this poll by three points.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In the fifth poll, conducted by Emerson College from August 13 to 14, with 1,000 likely voters, Harris received 49% of the vote, while Trump received 51%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Trump leads this poll by one point.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Moving forward to the fourth poll, also conducted by Emerson College on the same dates with a different 1,000 likely voters, Harris received 47% of the vote, while Trump received 47%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In the third poll, conducted by Redfield and Wilton Strategies, from August 12 to 15, with 825 likely voters, Harris received 46% of the vote, while Trump received 44%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Harris won this poll by two points.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"In the second poll, conducted by Signal from August 14 to 15, with 800 likely voters, Harris received 48% of the vote, while Trump received 47%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Again, Trump lost this poll by one point.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"In today's final poll, also conducted by Signal on the same dates with different 800 likely voters, Harris received 43% of the vote, while Trump received 44%.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
And Trump won today's final poll by one point.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Harris led in five out of the eight polls, with points ranging from one to four.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"However, Trump shows that he remains highly competitive by winning in two polls, with one point and tying in another, particularly in rural regions where his base is solid.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"This is one of the many reasons why I'm voting for her, not just policy, not just because she defends Democrats and democracy, and she is a new way forward and an inspiring visionary leader.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Not just because of that, but because also she's just a nice person.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"What a breath of fresh air that Kamala Harris is showing that America can look like love, can look like lifting people up, can look like unification.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Look at the confidence in this woman's eyes, the way she answers.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Watch, are you ready to face Donald Trump: yes, I am.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"Yes, best part of debate prep, i'm ready to watch Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And Kamala Harris has been preparing her whole life for this moment, the prosecutor versus the criminal.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So recapping real quick in Pennsylvania Harris up six points on Trump in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris up five points on Donald Trump, Wisconsin Harris up just one point, so that's why in the headline Quinnipiac basically said that one is a up for grabs state Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Okay, immigration, in my opinion, the Republicans best issue, i was also surprised at how close Harris now is in these swing states.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
So 50% say Trump is better on immigration in Pennsylvania 46% say Harris Michigan 49% say Trump 48% say Harris is better on immigration.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
Harris leads in Pennsylvania 52% to 45 Harris leads in Michigan 51% to 45 Harris leads in Wisconsin 50 to 47.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
This is from Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Molloy quote three crucial swing states wave a red flag at the Trump campaign the GOP is most go to attack strategies against Democrats on immigration and the economy may be losing momentum.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
"And again, Kamala Harris had a nice little surge in the betting odds today.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So three minutes ago, here's what it was basically right about a 10 percentage point lead for Kamala Harris 54.2% 44.5% betting odds that's the chances they win Kamala Harris with about dang close to a 10 percentage point lead over Donald Trump.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So again, Kamala Harris has jumped up about 2.7 percentage points today, mostly based on some good polling in those swing states, specifically in Pennsylvania, from Quinnipiac.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"And yes, I think the Biden Harris administration should get some credit for that.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
I think it's fair to say Trump lies more in Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Start with the debate, she beat Donald Trump in the debate and she's had some good polling numbers off that.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So we'll start with polling on September 11th, at least you have Harris plus four in a TIPP of Forbes, Harris plus four, Morning Consult, Harris plus six, DFP, Harris plus four, Yahoo, Harris plus four.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"You have the one outlier for Trump, which is Atlas Intel has Trump plus three.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
But then ABC Ipsos has Harris plus four.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"So 48, 14, 18, 22, 26 minus three is 23, 1234567, i think that's about my quick math is that's about three and a half or four points for Kamala Harris, all the polling since the debate.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Harris 48, Trump 47, so that one essentially a coin flip right there, and Jill Stein is still in there.",Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
It just kept going up after Trump.,Kamala Harris,Pennsylvania
"Ace, I really hope the nonsense of trying to hurt Trump stops and I'm not a Trump guy at all.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
We need to simmer down now when it comes to some of these crazy people going after Donald Trump the last couple of months.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania
