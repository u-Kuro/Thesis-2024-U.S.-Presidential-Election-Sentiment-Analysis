So that policy does not prohibit the state from bringing charges that violate Arizona state law and the grand jury wanted to bring those charges but that's another reason that the article reports the prosecutors told the grand jurors well there's this policy of not double charging even though let me add parenthetically double charging is okay it doesn't violate the double jeopardy clause because you can prosecute somebody for committing let me give you a concrete example I had a case involving a murder of a federal task force officer that's a federal crime if you murder a federal officer we have federal jurisdiction for that murder and we brought a federal case but anytime you kill another human being whether a federal officer or not it also violates state murder laws so that defendant could have been tried in both federal court for murdering a federal task force officer and state court for committing murder in violation of state laws so even though there is this policy that policy doesn't persuade me that that's why Arizona told the grand jurors no no no don't charge Donald Trump here is the third point I want to discuss and this is the one that I think may actually have driven the decision of the prosecutors to tell the grand jurors hold up not yet remember where we put a pin in the article we read the prosecutors told the grand jurors we're not sure that we have enough to prosecute Trump to indict Trump at this moment aha who were some of the other defendants that the grand jury did indict Mark Meadows Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis another one of Donald Trump's dirty lawyers and what did we learn in recent days Jenna Ellis has flipped and agreed to cooperate with Arizona state prosecutors and testify truthfully fully and accurately against Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows and all of the other remaining defendants in the Arizona case so might the prosecutors now believe they have enough to indict Donald Trump based on whatever it is Jenna Ellis provided the prosecutors by way of incriminating evidence about the other defendants and you may recall Jenna Ellis got what I would call a sweetheart deal prosecutors said if you testify truthfully and she sat down with them and told them all of the evidence she could provide and they recorded that conversation with her and her lawyer to lock in the evidence that she said she could provide they said we're gonna strike a deal with you that's basically a non-prosecution agreement we're gonna get rid of the pending charges against you because she was indicted if you testify truthfully against the other defendants so I suspect she's got some pretty darn important and incriminating evidence against the bigger criminal fish like Giuliani and Meadows and Trump so might the prosecutors now believe they have enough to indict Donald Trump even if there was some concern back when the grand jurors wanted to indict Trump initially but the prosecutor said hold up hold off not sure we have enough at this moment well maybe the moment has come and if they now have enough evidence to charge Donald Trump he should be indicted because justice matters friends as always please stay safe please stay tuned and I look forward to talking with you all again tomorrow,Donald Trump,Arizona,"['arizona', 'arizona arizona', 'trump arizona', 'state arizona', 'arizona trump', 'election arizona', 'voters arizona', 'arizona election', 'arizona biden', 'president arizona']"

2016 Trump wins the state of Arizona excuse me 48.7 45.1 and look Maricopa County goes red 47.7 44.3 a three point margin of victory in Maricopa and about a 3.6 margin of victory in the state of Arizona again I think Maricopa County goes may very well be how the state of Arizona goes Yuma 47.5 46.4 Navajo 51.1 40.9 and Pima finally 53.3 39.7 looking at 2012 Obama Romney this is a much bigger and by gone era honestly in Arizona where it's a nine point win for Romney over Obama 53.7 44.6 Maricopa was over 10 points in 2012 win for Romney Yuma 55.7 43.1 for Obama 53.3 to 45.4 and 52.7 45.7 I mean as much as I'm sure Trump would love to see a 2012 Obama Romney map 2020 is certain I think somewhere between 2020 and 2016 is what we're mostly looking at I wouldn't be shocked if every county stays the exact same from 2020 and 2024 but Maricopa County a hundred percent is the county I'm watching for does it stay blue and if it does what's the percentage does it flip red and what is the percentage that is what's going to decide how the state of Arizona goes on election night now looking at the party percentages for both Republicans and Democrats in 2020 Trump got 49.1% the vote lost a very close election 2016 Trump got 48.7% of the vote won a very close election in 2012 Romney got 53.7% and won the state when you look at 2024 the estimated range based on these numbers of the highest minus the lowest and taking the range of that added to the highest and lowest numbers a low point of Arizona Republicans at 43.7 a high of 58.7 and the average vote across the last three elections a 50.5% a range this close from 43.7 58.7 certainly shows that it is a very winnable race on both the Republican side and you're about to see on the Democratic side easily Republicans can win or lose Arizona depending on how the night goes very very close on the Democratic side very similar 2020 Biden got 49.4 2016 45.1 for Clinton and 2012 44.6 for Obama a low end of 39.8 on the range to a high of 54.2 kind of similar numbers for the Republicans very very winnable for both Republicans and Democrats in Arizona an average vote across last three elections of 46.4 so when you're looking at it the average vote across the last three elections does favor the Republicans the most recent election 2020 of Trump vs Biden when you look at just that one alone you would think okay that favors the Democrats then the estimated range very very narrowly favors the Republicans even though it's pretty much the same when you look at what the numbers are the Democrats are slightly lower Republicans are slightly higher but it's not by a huge margin it's very very close in that respect so you have to look at the polling data and that's super close only half of 1% of the vote separating Harrison Trump in the average Arizona is going to be very very close on election night and it's a state that can really go either way but in my prediction for the state of Arizona I have Donald Trump outperforming the polls slightly in the state and winning by 2% of the vote statewide this is one where I think the polls will just be a little bit off on election day in Arizona not by a huge margin only about 1.5% of the vote I think they'll be off by which is not a huge number when you look at polls considering the variance of maybe a hidden Trump vote that we saw in 2016 and 2020 I do have Trump winning the state of Arizona but not in a blowout not like a 2012 Obama Romney and not even as big of a win as 16 Trump vs Clinton I think the in between numbers of 2020 and 2016 somewhere in between that is where Trump and Harris end up and I think Trump wins the state of Arizona but given how close this election is if Harris won the state I won't lie I would not be totally shocked I do think Trump is favored to win the state right now that's why I'm making this prediction but it's gonna be a very very close state on election night and right now on the 2024 electoral map Kamala Harris is 81 electoral votes Donald Trump is up to 37 Harris started out with a big lead when I started with Washington Oregon California and Hawaii Trump has Alaska Idaho Montana Wyoming Utah Nevada and Arizona Trump was slowly starting to inch his way back up to Harris is 81 electoral votes and catch up however depending on which state comes next in the deep dive series maybe Trump's trend continues maybe it doesn't maybe Harris picks up some more electoral votes you'll have to tune in the next video to find out which state I'll be doing next but I really hope you will because hopefully

Now these counties here will report in earlier than Philadelphia because there are fewer people here than there are in Philadelphia and the thing to note is of all of these votes here in Allegheny in 2020 almost 65% of them went for Biden in this whole section here including Philadelphia it was about 66% of all the votes from this area went for Biden but in Philadelphia which is included in this number of the 66% but if you take this out and just look at Philadelphia 80% of the votes coming out of Philadelphia went to Biden and so when you look at 43% of all of the votes cast in Pennsylvania are coming from these two areas and that roughly 65% of all of those votes went to Biden it means that the state goes to the Democrat it's just the way that the numbers work out especially if there is a significant increase in the number of people voting in this area especially in Philadelphia and also over here in Allegheny which we expect to have happened in this election so come November when you're watching the election returns you are going to relax take a deep breath get out your popcorn and whatever adult beverages you might be consuming that night and you will just sit and watch the returns coming in from Pennsylvania and you will not care what is happening for the whole state of Pennsylvania until the Philadelphia metropolitan area starts reporting in and Allegheny County because between those two areas that is 40 it's going to be 43% of the vote and in fact I would say with the increase in voter participation for this particular election it could be anywhere from 45 46 48 percent of the entire vote coming out of those two areas and because the majority of the voters are voting for the Democrat this is why I predict Kamala Harris is taking Pennsylvania in this election it's just about the math,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['pennsylvania', 'trump pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania pennsylvania', 'pennsylvania state', 'pennsylvania trump', 'pennsylvania election', 'pennsylvania point', 'pennsylvania battleground', 'biden pennsylvania', 'state pennsylvania']"

 here is showing a narrow two-point lead over former president Donald Trump that is well within the margin of error our political editor Dennis Welch is here now to break down those numbers yeah and when you say within the margin of error what you're basically saying statistically it's a dead heat now Arizona's family commissioned the survey in partnership with the local public affairs firm high ground and it reaffirms what we've been seeing so far that Arizona's 11 electoral college votes which could determine who wins the White House are still very much in play for both candidates here are the top line numbers they reveal Harris leading Trump 47 percent to 45 the results also reveal that 45 percent of those surveyed say they've already made up their mind to vote for Harris while 41 percent say they will definitely be voting for Trump I think one of the biggest takeaways here is that the race is very close and getting closer we've seen some surveys where Trump has a narrow lead we've seen others where Harris has a slight lead all of them have been within the margin of error Paul Bents is the longtime Arizona pollster who conducted the survey commissioned by Arizona's family his data reveals that Harris is doing a better job convincing voters to cross party lines at this point the vice president has convinced more than 12 percent of likely Republican voters to support her on the other hand Trump has only managed to convince 1.7 percent of Democratic voters to back his candidacy the two candidates are also evenly split with voters who are unaffiliated with any party while Trump is leading by double digits with independence what we're really seeing is that the Democrats are much more solidified behind their candidate they very much circled the wagons whereas Republicans are still struggling internally with at least a portion of their party Harris is also doing better than expected with voters 65 years and older the two candidates are evenly split at 48% among this reliably Republican block and like the previous two presidential cycles Trump is doing much better in rural parts of the state than Harris while the VP leads in Arizona's two most populous counties Maricopa and Pima and this survey was conducted at the end of last week another interesting data point here is the gender gap with Harris winning more than 52 percent of female voters to Trump's 40 percent while Trump is winning over 50 percent of male voters to Harris's 42 percent yes we've been saying for a long time it's going to come down to a couple hundred thousand voters in seven swing states of course Arizona very pivotal and the last presidential race was decided by like ten point five thousand here in Arizona yeah and if you look at the data here maybe it's not surprising but 86 percent are pretty much made up there they're locked in so 14 percent out there maybe maybe could be moving movable but you know it's going to be very close we knew that I know the election is a little over a month away but remember early voting starts next week so we're already in the middle of this and Dennis these were a likely voters not just registered voters yeah these were picked by basically on how often they vote these are people who are reliable voters out there they wanted to get a sense of who were they supporting how are they voting what's going to happen with them now that does leave open some room could there be an influx of new voters out there have Republicans identified voters who haven't typically voted in the last election cycle the last couple could Democrats do the same thing there's always a lot of questions to be answered well with these polls there's always things you can look at with a little suspicion just like every poll but as politicians have told me for years decades now the only poll that matters is in November yeah take a good thing they call this a snapshot in time which is what it is we like it it's interesting to see the breakdown Dennis thank you,Kamala Harris,Arizona,"['points arizona', 'bit separation', 'arizona harris', 'separation', 'lead vote', 'dennis', 'colorado', 'percent voters', 'limitations state', 'percent mind']"

Now we have a new poll from the New York Times with Sienna College this is an A plus rated pollster apparently the best the best even though their polls are all over the place that this election season but they show Kamala Harris with a four point lead when you don't round out the results over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania when you round these are the numbers that they give us it is 50% for Kamala Harris 47% for Donald Trump a three point lead when rounded when you unround Trump falls down to 46% which gives her a very impressive four point lead in Pennsylvania and you will look at why this four point lead is so important not to mention Arizona of course while we have this poll up Donald Trump really expanding his lead in Arizona to now a 6% margin very impressive for him but we you know we really have had this common consensus now for quite a while now for months now that Donald Trump will carry the state of Arizona as well as other Sun Belt states but Pennsylvania is the important one here Arizona only has 11 electoral votes Pennsylvania has 19 in such a close race like this that eight more from Pennsylvania sorry yeah eight more on that really does matter a lot so that four point lead is important because we always talk about you know how much are the polls overestimated Joe Biden in the 2020 election right because when you look at 2020 he was expected to win by only four point seven percent and I say only because take that with with a state like Wisconsin in 2020 where Joe Biden was expected to win in the polls on election day by eight point four percent he only won it by point six so he was overestimated basically eight percent almost in the state of Wisconsin while you head over to Pennsylvania again he was expected to win by four point seven he won it by one point two so he was only over estimated here by some three and a half percent so to see Kamala Harris with the four point lead on rounded in Pennsylvania that's big because I do want to preface this with saying that I don't think that Kamala Harris will be overestimated in the polls at all I currently think that she will be underestimated in the polling so even if she is overestimated as much as Joe Biden was in the 2020 election in Pennsylvania she still wins again Biden was overestimated by three and a half percent in Pennsylvania when you do the math Harris has a four point lead currently she would still win the state by a very narrow margin so Pennsylvania is hugely important right you know so that was just to show you know how important this single poll is considering that it isn't a plus pollster but now we have to talk about Pennsylvania because the fact that the fact the matter is she is running away with Pennsylvania it's a very narrow lead um in in of court like the average I'm in the aggregate of polls um which is expected and again I don't I do think that Harris will outpace what polls are expecting I really do because poll stars are pollsters are worried about underestimating the Trump factor once again and everything like that so they are really boosting Trump's are they're giving an emphasis on Trump areas because they're you know the polling industry is you know going down right now in the dumps um so again they're really trying to get it accurate this time not underestimate Trump ultimately I think that Harris is being underestimated now just like 2022 the Democrats were but when it comes to the average you can see Harris has never let up once in the state of Pennsylvania that's insane that is absolutely insane Harris has kept a lead in Pennsylvania this entire race now let's compare that to a state like North Carolina for a moment we see we see um in the beginning of the race Trump had a pretty steady lead then Harris took the lead for a moment there for literally like two days then he was even then Trump took the back the lead then it was even again Trump took the lead Harris took the lead by point to Trump took the lead Harris took the lead Trump took the lead again Harris took the lead Trump took the lead and he still has the lead less than 1% this is the case and this is the most extreme case but this is a case that's going that's happening with many many many battleground states Michigan not Michigan sorry Wisconsin Nevada especially Arizona Georgia for sure but what you notice is that it's not happening in Pennsylvania and that's important the fact that there is a common consensus in the polling numbers is important fact that common layers is a clear leader is a clear favorite to win in Pennsylvania that's important let's just take a look at at the 538 forecast here let's I don't know what they are currently projected to be honest um they say that the presidential race is extremely narrow but I assume they say of course that Harris is favored to win in Pennsylvania you can see there she has a 52 to 48 percent chance of winning the state but looking at Pennsylvania specifically again it is so incredibly important that Kamala Harris does have a lock on Pennsylvania that's what I've been saying for a while when you look at the electoral map Pennsylvania proves to be extremely important this is my forecast that's the map these are all the numbers this is how I think that the election will go if it were held today or tomorrow or whatever so Pennsylvania is critical obviously to Kamala Harris on now if Trump does win Pennsylvania Kamala Harris actually still wins the election however she then has literally zero wiggle room the only place that she could lose is Nebraska second district resulting in her still winning the election even if she loses just Nevada on top of that you know just two slight changes in my forecast then she loses the election 267 to 271 however however North Carolina is basically toss-up I have a Harris plus 0.1 percent because I don't know it's too hard to tell there are too many factors Mark Robinson being on the ballot the state shifting left rapidly right now there are so many factors to consider North Carolina it's virtually toss-up I think that Harris wins by honestly a few thousand votes so look I would not be surprised in the slightest if Trump wins North Carolina because the odds really are 50-50 in my forecast right now considering that margin of Harris plus 0.1 so if North Carolina does go red which you say I'm on a chance that it goes red as it goes blue then she can't lose Pennsylvania then she has to hold Pennsylvania so the fact that she as I outlined she is you know she has this sort of lock on Pennsylvania right now as she has had throughout this race that's important because it is critical to her path to victory then if she holds Pennsylvania she could even lose Nevada Nevada could even go to Donald Trump and it could still result in a 270 win for Harrison walls 270 is the minimum you need to win the presidency that is just two electoral votes up against Trump and Vance so North Carolina and Nevada could easily go Republican but as long as she has Pennsylvania she wins the election and she holds the other blue wall states now what if Trump wins Pennsylvania it's you know obviously it's important to Harris's victory but if Trump is going to win the election of course I really think that you know he might need Pennsylvania however that he doesn't need it he could he could simply just run the Sun Belt North Carolina Georgia Arizona Nevada and then flip Wisconsin I think that Wisconsin will be closer than Pennsylvania so that of course can absolutely happen but if Pennsylvania does go red it really opens the door for Donald Trump if he wins the Sun Belt plus Pennsylvania he's at 287 17 more than he needs then he could even lose North Carolina and he still wins the election or he could actually lose he could even lose Nevada and Arizona and he still wins the election 270 to 268 so you know Pennsylvania everything weighs on Pennsylvania almost Donald Trump and Kamala Harris still paths to victory especially Trump Trump still has a path to victory without Pennsylvania however Pennsylvania is one of the most likely states to go to either candidate because of how split it is right now so it's very good for Kamala Harris when she gets polls like this which shows her from an A plus pollster with a pretty steady lead in the most critical battleground state Pennsylvania and again I think that she will win it Joe Biden won it by 1.2% in 2020 and what we have seen is a massive left-word trend in the suburbs the suburbs that dominate Pennsylvania elections and we are seeing massive left-ward trends across suburbs or in suburbs across the nation so if Pennsylvania can continue to trend to the left then the Democrats are in for a really good result in Pennsylvania so look at this Chester County Pennsylvania vote for Mitt Romney in 2012 by 0.2% he lost the state Obama won the state by 5% fast forward four years later Chester County went from 0.2 for Romney to 10 for Hillary Clinton now Donald Trump won the state so while the state as a whole trended seven points or six points I should say towards the Republicans Chester County became ten points more Democratic that you never see furthermore he went from ten points in 2016 to a stunning 17 points for Biden in 2020 suburbs eight Donald Trump and I believe that now more than ever with someone like Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket for the Democrats she will be able to really continue this trend possibly you know trend it more these at least Chester County trend it more towards the Democrats than we have seen in past elections in 2016 and 2020 so that's the state of the race right now in Pennsylvania hugely important state Kamala Harris definitely favored to win so thank you all
