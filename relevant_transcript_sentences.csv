"A lot of people on the right have been very critical of Dr. Oz, including myself, and I will continue to be critical of Dr. Oz.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
Federman now says he doesn't want to debate Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"In the case of McCormick versus versus Oz, it almost certainly did.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
Dr. Oz is going to be Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
That's another thing that's factored into Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
And I'm just waiting to see whether or not we're actually going to see Dr. Oz and Federman on stage together actually debating the issues.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
So let's dive into this Trump endorsed Dr. Oz in the Senate race.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"But Dr. Oz, first of all, I saw this yesterday.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"But at the at the risk of him endorsing Oz, it's not exactly what it is.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"Interestingly enough, one of the reasons that Trump says he endorsed Oz, even though, as you point out, he's probably to use a MAGA word squishy on a couple of their issues, transgender issues being among them, is he thinks that Oz will do better in a general election.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
Trump's argument is that Dr. Oz is who can win the general election.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
And it was that Dr. Oz that beat him out.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
I'm unclear what Oz really believes because he keeps changing his mind on a number of these issues.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"And you raised a great point, Leland, about Dr. Oz and whether he really believes in the ideology of this.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"Put that aside for a moment for all their criticisms of Federman, which include just making fun of the guy for a medical problem that he had.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
They're the reason dr. Oz lost the Senate race.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
I think he's worse than Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
Like people are gonna be like even like my fellow Armenians are like I can't support Dr. Oz because he's Turkish or whatever.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
And this is where you are today with Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"It quite literally if the Senate ends up 50 50 in favor of Democrats because of Kamala Harris is the tiebreaking vote, you could accurately blame Trump for losing Republicans, the Senate, by jumping in and endorsing Oz rather than McCormick or staying out of it altogether.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"And honestly Oz may be the lesser of two evils between those two, but that's not enough in my opinion.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
Lots of attacks by the Oz campaign on Federman's health.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"It's like we say, yeah, Oz and McCormick.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
Oz is better than McCormick in my view.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
And that's what Dr. Oz did.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
And I'm not entirely sure Dr. Oz does that and the guy's got a lot of controversial statements in his past surrounding a wide variety of things.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
And so it's hard to say because in some ways Dr. Oz is representative of Trumpism very sort of progressive on LGBT issues and then very.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"On the other hand, Oz lost.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"He is up against the Republican candidate, Dr. Oz.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"So the point is that it's changing a lot and obviously it's very up for grabs, but Dr. Oz lost the state by almost six points back in 2022.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
So like Dr. Oz being a carpet bagger is actually part of this conversation too.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"So I honestly, between those two, I would rather have Oz.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
The Trump in Dorsey campaigning with Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"That to me is one of the most fascinating races period because you have a candidate like Dr. Oz, then you have the more traditional Republican candidate in McCormick.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
I think McCormick is more dangerous because Oz I see is more of a grifter.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
So he's going to go out there and endorse Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
It's like would I support Dr. Oz over John Federman?,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
Maybe they think orange man bad.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
Dr. Oz is a man who truly believes in Make America Great Again or the MAGA movement.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
And that might be the pro of Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
And Dr. Oz is just an unproven product because who knows what he's been saying his entire career.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
I think Oz is slightly better.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"The Oz campaign put out some ads ridiculing Federman's health, although Oz personally said it wasn't me doing that, but it was still attached to the campaign at the debate.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
So it's just it's totally splintered in the way that even Vance and Mandel in Ohio didn't because Barnett was so strong on Oz on abortion in that debate just came out swinging.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
That's a fact for crying out loud Oz lost his vote by like 40 or 50 points.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"But Dr. Oz is sort of problematic from a like if you are a hardcore Trump voter, Dr. Oz is not somebody that you want to hold your nose and have to vote for.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"Stahl makes the case and I believe he's right that were it not for Trump's endorsement of Oz, McCormick would have won the primary.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"But Dr. Oz has been that guy in Trump's circle, extended circle for a while.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
I think Oz is more of a grifter.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"So like I said, Dr. Oz and McCormick both are awful.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
It started to get really ugly because there are people in the Trump camp who are extremely dissatisfied with his decision to back Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
That was one of the polls that had John Federman defeating Dr. Oz by four percentage points in the final poll.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"We're a part of history, for sure, Ozzy.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
And then he goes on to say Oz believes in health care reform or whatever.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"In 2022, they said that Dr. Oz, the Republican nominee for Senate here, would win by roughly a point.",Donald Trump,Michigan,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"

This is Dr. David D. Shine for Saving America.,Donald Trump,Arizona,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
You know him as Dr. Oz from TV.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
And it make it all the more embarrassing to Oz that he couldn't beat the guy that they describe as a mentally retarded person.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"And to me, the really scary thing is that Oz didn't lose by more.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
I mean Parnell would have been far better than Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"

So it could be possible that Oz has a 10 point lead and wins comfortably in a way that like Vance did after he got the Trump endorsement.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"So he goes on to say Oz wrote books, so he's good.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
"People don't love Dr. Oz, although he does in polling have a decent chunk of the vote.",Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
The polls show it like Dr. Oz being the only one that can win.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
The bad news is he endorsed Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
And if it wasn't for the mail-in votes Oz would have won because a lot of these votes were before the debate which everyone agrees was a complete disaster for Federman.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"

He's endorsed Dr. Mehmet Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"
It's so interesting that Trump endorsed Dr. Oz.,Donald Trump,Pennsylvania,"['oz', 'dr. oz', 'dr.', 'oz oz', 'federman', 'oz campaign', 'mccormick oz', 'oz trump', 'oz senate', 'oz guy']"

yet look Michiganders in the eye and say I'm doing right by you as the top lawyer top cop in in Michigan she indicts and she indicts just the fake electors she doesn't make it a broader a broader conspiracy though she could have and brought in everybody else including Donald Trump and John Eastman of Rudy Giuliani and everybody else she didn't do that she focused uniquely on just her citizens her residents of Michigan and brought a count or so against each one of them and that's the way she can maintain her own case at the same time Jack Smith goes after Donald Trump and the others and the other states this could be a model for the other states we're seeing for instance in Arizona the Attorney General doing about the same thing she's just further behind she's not ready to indict she's developing her evidence but I expect now based on you know Dana Nessel breaking that glass ceiling of prosecutors state prosecutors others will do the same thing because they'll say it can be it can be plus it can be two it doesn't have to be well we have to wait to see what the feds do about our own criminals in our own midst we can do it too I think this is going to be a real blueprint and a

house of Michigan even the leadership in the state house the speaker of the house for Michigan right and also the majority leader for Michigan went in November 20th of that year to the White House to meet with Donald Trump and they came away and issued a press statement that said yeah yeah we met with the president but we didn't really see anything that indicates that this wasn't a fair election or that anything was unfair about Michigan or that its votes should go somewhere else well apparently 16 people that met in the basement of the GOP headquarters and you can't make this stuff up thought otherwise they thought there was a way to steal the election from Joe Biden and undercut the will of the people in their own state and hand deliver the the the presidency to the person that they wanted not the people that michigan michigan people wanted but even the leadership in the state house thought that was crazy uh but wasn't crazy enough for these people who are these people well let's just run it down Kathy Bearden age 70 Hank Chote 72 Amy Fachinello 55 Clifford Frost 75 Stanley Grot 71 John Haggard 82 Mary Ann Henry 65 Tim King 56 I'm reading out there their ages so you know these aren't children these people know better you know these are you know 50 60 70 and 80 year olds in in the state of Michigan Michelle Lundgren 73 Miss Shawn Maddock 55 James Renner 76 Myra Rodriguez 64 Rose Rook 81 Mary Ann Sheridan 69 Ken Thompson 68 Kent Vanderwood 69 and of the 16 I just mentioned two in particular Kathy Bearden is on the Republican National Committee and his close friends with its chairperson Rona McDaniel Mitt Romney's niece and Michelle Maddock former co-chair of the Michigan GOP you have been indicted by your attorney general and here here is the indictment everybody gets the same swag bag from the attorney general Nessel everybody gets that I just listed one count of conspiracy to commit forgery which is a 14 year possible felony two counts of forgery a 14 year felony one count of conspiracy to commit uttering and publishing usually means a false statement a 14 year felony one count of uttering and publishing a false statement another 14 year felony one count of conspiracy to commit election law forgery a five-year felony and two counts of election law forgery a five-year felony and the the attorney general's office we we've heard her statement at the top of this hot take of attorney general Nessel but they went on to say in a written press statement that the false electors actions undermine the public's faith in the integrity of our elections and we believe also plainly violated the laws by which we administer our elections in Michigan my department meaning the attorney general of Michigan's department has prosecuted numerous cases cases of election law violations throughout my tenure and it would be malfeasance for the greatest magnitude of the greatest magnitude if my department failed to act here in the face of overwhelming evidence of an organized effort to circumvent the lawfully cast ballots of millions of Michigan voters in a presidential election couldn't have said it any better than attorney general Nessel I don't think this is going to be the end I think this is the blueprint all attorney generals in the battleground states can use to both establish their own territory get their own piece of turf and real estate to go after their citizens involved in the fake electors and kind of stay away from this sprawling more conspiracy oriented set of charges and indictments brought by either Jack Smith which would include Donald Trump and or Fawny Willis the Fulton County DA who is also looking at places like Michigan and the as part of her conspiracy but this is a perfect thread the needle right this is putting a camel through the eye of the needle in the form of let's just go after our state's bad people alleged bad people and we'll do that and we'll stay away from Jack Smith's prosecution and we can live harmoniously side by side as parallel prosecutors and that's that's what attorney generals who are the top prosecutors for each state can do if you do it the way that attorney general Nessel did I'll follow on breaking news and otherwise an analysis developments just like this one at the intersection of US law and politics here only on the Midas Touch Network I do
