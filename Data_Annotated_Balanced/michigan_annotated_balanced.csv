"If you went to it thinking you're a Trump supporter, you probably think it was a three on one fight between Trump, the moderators and the vice president, right, and then there's the middle, right, and the question about them is, did they watch, and if they did, did they stay up late enough to watch the whole thing, what did they get: apparently, there were like 70 million people watched their war.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,-1,0
"I don't think there will be, Donald Trump never turns away from a debate.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
"He loves the opportunity to show his leadership, his policies, his values and his his approach to leading the nation.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
So I would be very eager and excited to see him again.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
So a segment of the community say we're going to vote for Trump because we want to punish the Democratic administration.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,-1,1
"And what happened after that: during Trump, we did not have any war.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"That's every group, they have a different factor why they are voting for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1

"And frankly, we were insulted that every time Donald Trump or J. Vance come to Michigan, they lie to our people.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
They insult people.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"Trump insulted my city of Detroit where I'm from, where I was raised, where people saw power and potential and a young black man like me and helped me to be my best self.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"Like Donald Trump and J.D, vance, they talked explicitly about the fact they're going to renege on the government's promises to the people of Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
His support could potentially double this year compared to 2016.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"One thing that we did hear a lot tonight was, why Trump is a horrible president, why we gotta prevent Trump from becoming president again.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"I didn't hear dreaming big, i heard why we, so much of the argument is about why we don't want Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
46% say they will vote for former President Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0,0
"Look at the results from the past two elections, in 2016, former President Donald Trump won Michigan by just 0.3%.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1,1
"Republican candidates had won that area by double digits, but it's an area where Donald Trump hasn't really connected.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,1,-1
You talk about 99% certainty of what Trump will do.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1,0
"Just get it done, when you talk about a 99% sort of possibility of knowing what he is up to, doesn't it worry you when you consider voting for Donald Trump and you hear his message on end to Israel at this point: i've heard many things come out of his mouth that were contradictory.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"And right now we haven't gotten any specific policies, but he has stated that he wanted to stop the war.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,-1,1
"And what I can say is that with 100% certainty, had this had been occurring under the Trump's presidency, we would have seen Democrats stand up and find their moral compass as they did when he moved the embassy.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1,0
"So even if Trump was to do exactly the same thing that Biden is doing, I have a little bit of hope that perhaps Democrats would find their moral compass and stand up and say that we would need a ceasefire by now.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1,0
"A net gain of one point for Trump, so we have pretty consistent polling shifts here not only internally to this poll look but with the previous one we did for Michigan showing between zero and three points gained for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"Trump has also made at least a dozen stops in Michigan this year, but some campaign operatives have sounded the alarm that his campaign has let old-fashioned ground game tactics, like door knocking and billboards, slide in several swing states, including Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0,0
Why wouldn't they be trying to do that: because they don't want Trump to be president.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"Right now, our partners at FiveThirtyEight give Donald Trump a 51% chance of winning the presidency.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1,0

Trump starts with a strong 98 electoral vote basis.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"In fact, since 1992, it has always basically fallen to the Democrats until 2016 and Trump won the state.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1

"Today at his rally in the state of Michigan, he just got a pretty big endorsement from numerous members of the Arab and Muslim community.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
But it tells you a lot about how much our politics has changed and largely because of this very effective messaging by Trump that he's going to be the peace candidate.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"Well, Trump saying that he'll stop the war, kind of both sides, find ways, find angles, they can be happy with that.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,-1,1
"As the president said, we just had a positive meeting with President Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1

We are with President Trump because we want a strong economy.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
The second prediction is Donald J. Trump will be the 47th president of the United States of America.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
You have the Arab leaders going out endorsing Trump on stage.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0,1
You have the Palestine protester on the same exact day screaming down at the rally.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,-1,1
What about Donald Trump: Donald Trump has a solid safe seats of 188 electoral college votes.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
"In 2016, when Trump won, and this was the shock because a Republican had not won those states until 20 years prior to that, when he won Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, these are the so-called blue wall states.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1,1
I think we have to each do our part to prevent a Donald Trump presidency.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,0,-1
Donald Trump called me that woman from Michigan as an insult.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"Around 80% of the African Americans here in Michigan vote for the Democratic Party, and many of them fear that if Donald Trump wins this election, the racism and discrimination they face will get worse.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"No, I'm not so sure, retiree John Brady is backing Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
She reflects more of what I see.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
Retired nurse Paul Mudri is a Reagan Democrat who backs Vice President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
Sloan Davis is part of the Harris coalition but half-heartedly.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
"Kamala Harris leads in key battleground states Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, according to New Washington Post polls.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Harris holds narrow leads in four critical battleground states Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Despite not having overwhelmingly positive favorability ratings, her stance on these key issues is helping her win over voters who may have reservations about her candidacy, but are still aligning with her on policy grounds.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"In Michigan and Pennsylvania, Harris has a two-point edge in each, both of which are critical to either candidate's path to victory.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
One of the key factors driving Harris's performance is her overwhelming support among young women.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Additionally, Harris is performing well on issues like health care and abortion.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Harris holds a slim but consistent lead in the Rust Belt states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which were crucial to Joe Biden's 2020 victory. If she can maintain these leads, they could form a key part of her electoral firewall.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"Harris had maintained a lead here throughout much of the campaign, but the latest data shows that the state has tightened.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
"You can see on the basis of this result, Kamala Harris narrowly wins, but literally she's on the nose.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
And today we are gonna be talking about the battleground state of Michigan getting a whole new set of new polls out of the state showing Kamala Harris expanding from where she was before of a minor lead across the state.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
Now to the most recent poll from Michigan State University showing Kamala Harris with roughly a 4.6% 4.7% lead across the battleground state.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
That showed Michigan in a position where Kamala Harris held a two point lead against the former president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"And like I said, Emerson College, not Emerson College, Bloomberg and Morning Consult, the Michigan State University poll, some other data points too that we've been seeing, Quinnipiac University just released a data point just a few days ago, showing Kamala Harris with a 3-point lead in the state of Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"That Kamala Harris holds a narrow advantage in the state of Michigan, enough that I actually might translate her to winning in that battleground state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"And granted, the numbers in Michigan don't always translate to amazing numbers for Kamala Harris in states like Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"241 to 219 means that Kamala Harris also has additional pathways to the presidency because Michigan has given her 15 electoral votes that boosts her forward, right: boost her to 241.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"She's no longer at that number, 226, which is where she was before, 241 from 226. That's good for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
It gives her options as to how she reaches the magic number of 270 electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"And so you can see Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and Michigan would be enough to put Kamala Harris over 270, which means even if she loses Florida, Texas, Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania would really be a shocker here.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1,0
"I think Kamala Harris should be happy to see some data points like this that show Kamala Harris leading in Michigan, and in a way in the majority in some of these polls.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"When you take a look at what's expected of her in 538, even though she has a 55% chance of winning the electoral votes in Michigan, she's only barely at that majority mark, 50.3 to 49.7.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"Maybe some of the internal, show Kamala Harris, in a pretty okay position in the state of Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"But I think that also speaks to the range at which we could see Harris win by one, two, three points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Michigan, same thing, Kamala Harris is in a good position in Michigan, there's no denying that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
"Doesn't mean she would be guaranteed to win it, the answer is absolutely not.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"And I mean, all these different things, Quinnipiac, Michigan State University, TLDR, the numbers are getting better for Kamala Harris in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Should Kamala Harris win Michigan, I'd honestly bet that she's winning Pennsylvania and potentially with it, the presidency as she goes across the electoral map and wins individual swing states that get her closer and closer to 270 until she absolutely crosses it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"No guarantee that she wins Michigan at this point. It's obviously more likely than not, but I will say this, Michigan has been a tricky one for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"But as of right now, the numbers are telling us that Kamala Harris is doing a lot better in Michigan than she was before.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
And some very reputable sources as they enter into the final stages of polling and understanding the race are saying Kamala Harris is starting to win back support.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"If there was ever a time for Kamala Harris to turn around a race, turn around some of these battlegrounds, that time would be now.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1,0
"It's because even though she's losing big lead, she's losing big lead among groups that make up a small portion of the electorate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"And she's making it up among groups that make up a big portion of the electorate, even if the movements are small.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"When it's all about turnout, what's key is enthusiasm, right, you know, whose voters are more excited about going out to vote: and Harris has like a 10 point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
She also has about a 10 point advantage on women voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
So I see a lot of signs that polling is not picking up their advantages for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
And I think that she's going to win.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
So this conventional wisdom that on college campuses is all women and they're all voting for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
Again I take your point that you think Harris is on track to win here.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"The ticket has now changed, how do you view this new ticket, would you meet with the Harris-Walz ticket today: as I've expressed since President Biden has stepped aside and Vice President Harris has become the nominee for the Democratic Party, we believe the door has cracked open that there's now opportunity to have dialogue for us to understand how Vice President Harris will differentiate herself from President Biden on the path for Gaza.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
We have seen thus far that she has demonstrated being tough on rhetoric as it pertains to the remarks she made following her private meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
"But more than just being tough on rhetoric, we're hoping that she pairs that rhetoric with tough policy.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
We believe that this should be the shield for Vice President Harris and Governor Walz on this issue. And that's probably going to help Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"And if you look at 538, their polling average, Harris has a slight advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"She'll have 276, so that's something else that we're looking at.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
"There's a wave, a Democratic wave going across the country as she's going around with all these events here.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"Is it possible to keep this momentum going, what does she need to do to keep the momentum between now and November: i think that she keeps doing what she's doing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
I think that she's got a ton of momentum.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"People are excited, her message of hope and positiveness and what's right about the country is connecting with people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"And again, no matter your politics, it's hard to have watched that and not to clear Harris the winner, at least poll after poll continues to show.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"And on the behalf of 245 active in retirees in Michigan, our members want to make sure that we don't lose Michigan and Walz and Harris are the ticket that we're gonna bring home in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"It's the same old rhetoric and we're not going back to Tim Walz and Kamala Harris, give us a vision for all people, working class people, not just teamsters, not just unions, even though all the unions at Michigan support the Harris-Walz campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,1
And she made sure that they could retire with dignity and respect.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have the same vision as we do here in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"But the overall majority of Michigan teamsters at all the labor unions in Michigan understand that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz give us the best opportunity to move forward from hatred, visceral comments, they're desecrating our veterans.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"I've come a third generation veteran family and they should be honored and cherished, not disgraced. And Kamala Harris and Tim Walz who wore a uniform for 24 years, surely gets that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
And Kamala Harris will never stop fighting for middle-class Americans. She understands the struggles.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"But the truth is, I can have those conversations with Kamala Harris when we disagree.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
"When Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Kamala Harris became the nominee, Adam was initially hopeful.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"You know, we hear a lot of talks about a ceasefire, but Kamala Harris and everybody, they say, you know, we want a ceasefire, but, and then what we want to see is a permanent ceasefire.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"You know, I know right now in the polls, Kamala Harris is up. But guess what? Hillary Clinton, a week before elections, was up 10% in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"Now, a recent national poll puts Kamala Harris' support with the Muslim community at 30%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
So we also need to talk about Kamala Harris being a threat to our democracy and the Democratic Party being a threat to our democracy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"The campaign, VP Harris, the administration, they have repeatedly said to us that they actually don't want us to mobilize their people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"If Harris does not move as it relates to policy, I cannot come out and endorse Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"But as more and more Arab and Muslim voters stop being loyal to the Democratic Party, it could make Kamala Harris's path to the White House extremely difficult.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"The race in Michigan is extremely close, with Harris holding a slight but consistent lead in most polls.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"A fourth TIP Insights poll from the same period, with 741 different likely voters, shows Harris leading 47% to 45%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"However, Harris began closing the gap, and by mid-August she had taken the lead, peaking around August 12th with a 3.4 percentage point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Since then, her margin has slightly decreased, but she continues to hold the upper hand.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"This shift suggests that Harris's campaign efforts, particularly in urban centers like Detroit and Ann Arbor, have effectively rallied her base.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
Harris's ability to sustain her momentum and possibly widen her lead will be critical in securing Michigan's electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
So how big of a problem does Harris have with young men: she has one.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
Another demographic that Harris seems to have some issues with is Arab American voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
She is doing better amongst women.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"I mean, look, relatively speaking, she is a newer candidate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
She's not talking about the economy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
She's not talking about the border.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"January 6th stuff, that's where she pulls better.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
So she's at least going to close on the two issues that voters trust her and think she's best able to handle.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"What is she gonna do: look, the polling is all trending away from her.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"Right now in the Rust Belt, right: the three most important swing states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, right now, she's behind in all, he may sweep all three of them.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"And in Michigan, which is probably the solid, most solid blue of those three, in the last 10 polls, she's only up by one.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"But we'll, by specific Harris, signal to Democratic voters, 101,000 in Michigan, that she will end the killing and occupation of Palestinians.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"So yes, I think that she is at risk for losing peace between swing states, especially in states like Michigan, where we have the largest concentration of Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, people who know firsthand the effects and the impact of American-funded bombing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"If Kamala wants my vote, I want her to take a hard stance against these forever wars.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1,0
"I want her to take a hard stance against giving Israel any more money, especially for military purposes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"She can come out tomorrow and be like, hey, ceasefire, we're going to stop funding this war and we're going to move on.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1,0
"But I got to see, I don't know, Vice President Harris, I don't know her that well.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"For Kamala Harris, these states represent both a formidable challenge and a significant opportunity to connect with voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"To secure the presidency, she'll need to win back voters who felt left behind by the Democratic Party's previous strategies and policies.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"But beyond that, she'll also need to energize a base that is still reeling from the shock of 2016, reigniting their passion and commitment.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
She must unite a fractured Democratic Party while also appealing to independents and disaffected Republicans.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
The outcome in Michigan and Wisconsin could very well hinge on her ability to do just that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
Kamala Harris faces an uphill battle in Michigan and Wisconsin.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
She needs to convince voters that she understands their concerns and has a plan to address them.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
She needs to articulate a clear vision for the future that resonates with their hopes and aspirations.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
One of her biggest challenges is overcoming the perception that she is a creature of the coastal elite.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"She needs to connect with Midwestern voters on a personal level, showing them that she understands their values and shares their priorities.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
She needs to convince them that she's not just another politician making empty promises.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"She needs to show them that she's a leader who will fight for them, someone who will listen to their concerns and work to improve their lives.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"If enough Republicans in key states like Michigan and Wisconsin decide to vote for Harris, it could be enough to tip the scales in her favor.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
This has led some to believe that Haley is tacitly encouraging her supporters to back Harris as a way to move the Republican Party away from Trumpism.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
The extent to which Haley's supporters will ultimately back Harris is unclear.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
She'll also need to generate enthusiasm among young voters and minority voters in Detroit.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0

Peters told reporters after a Senate field hearing in Lansing that he quickly endorsed Harris for the nomination and noted just how quick he thinks the running mate selection will be.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"There very well could be other names that are just not being talked about, but I know that Vice President Harris is going to have a choice of a lot of qualified individuals.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"And when Kamala Harris was endorsed by the President and everybody across the party, all across the country, stepped up to say now let's come together and be unified with her, I think it bodes very well for the future.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
Kamala Harris is the best option we have right now.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
She's restored a bit of that faith that democracy will win.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
I know Kamala is more like women's rights.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"NBC reports, Harris appears to be okay with the collective jitters, recognizing that if Democrats fear they might lose, they're more apt to show up at the polls and help her win.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Do you agree with that, i mean, 17 days out, how do you see Harris's chances as of today, right now: i mean, it's a complete coin flip at this point, but I do think that fear of losing is a very good motivator.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1,0
She needs to find some way to recapture the momentum.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
Kamala Harris has not been the Democratic nominee officially for a very long time.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"So, she was being strategic with the calendar she was given.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
How critical do you see both Obamas as being on the trail for Harris: because she's just trying to energize that coalition.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"Here's another look over here, talking about these seven battleground states what we want to do today is kind of take the logic because everything's so close right, we want to take the logic and flip it on its head turn it 180 degrees around all right: upper Midwest these states here right the blue wall Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania that's where Kamala Harris wants to turn the trick to get to 270.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1,0
"What makes America great is our, part of it is our economy and the Harris administration is coming after auto workers jobs.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"I think things are just average for me right now. I don’t believe he’d make life worse, but I’m unsure he’d help either. As for her, it’s hard to say—she’d be the first woman president, which would be different and significant. But I’ve heard a lot of Black men aren’t voting, and if that’s true, it might hurt Kamala Harris’ chances. I don’t know why—it’s just what everyone’s talking about.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"We're sick of it. Everybody hates them now, and that's huge, too, because 20% of the Detroit suburb of Troy is Indian American. So you're an Indian American, and Kamala Harris is Indian American, but you're not supporting her. Most Indian Americans are not, even though she's from the community, but she doesn’t seem to consider it anyway",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"Depending on what day you're asking, she might say, if it’s a Monday, ""I’m Black,"".",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
What did she do: nothing and she wants to start helping the day one.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"That was a bad move. She thinks they believe she’s going to help, but honestly, she’s not going to help. It just brings back memories",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"She gets destroyed because that is a lie. What happened to Cheney? She’s not going to help with anything. Traditionally, Indian Americans used to vote for Democrats, but this election cycle is different.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
We have a chance with Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"But with resentment swelling over the White House's support for Israel in its conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah, Dearborn voters are using their influence to threaten Vice President Kamala Harris' bid by withholding their votes or backing another candidate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
I'm committed for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
Kamala Harris on the other hand is focusing on abortion.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"And what about Kamala Harris, what's the key thing she needs to convince Michiganders to do: to turn out and vote.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"Mayor, share with us what it means to have vice president and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris here in technically Lansing, but Lansing to speak to workers at New York.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"It's not my business, but Kamala didn't earn any of our votes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"She could lose and they'll say, well, if only those few thousand people in Dearborn or Hamtrack or other parts of Detroit who are Arab and Muslim had voted for her, she would have won.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"It's like, so like when we're going to get scapegoated, what are they going to do, are they going to kill another hundred thousand of us, it's like seriously, what more can they do: now, the Harris campaign knows they have a problem.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"She's a compassionate, caring person that has integrity.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
She's the real deal.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"I mean they've called out Barack Obama to lecture black men, the Kamala Harris campaign has.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
"It's so bad, these internal polls, that Kamala Harris has agreed to an interview with Fox News and Bret Baier.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
The world wasn't at war and that's nothing that Kamala Harris can say that she's done because she's made it all worse.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"Well, that's true, and look, the biggest muff, the biggest gaffe maybe of the last because Kamala Harris had a terrible two weeks.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"And that also tells you how bad things are for the Harris campaign, don't they: absolutely.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"Up front as the whole idea of Barack Obama lecturing black men about voting for Kamala Harris went right off the tracks into the ditch and black women saying, you know what, who are you to lecture black men: another failed opportunity, another failed delivery of a talking point.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
And you've got to remember Kamala Harris has been a candidate for president of the United States for only about 92 days.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
I think the conversations need to continue about how a Harris administration would handle the economy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
"That's really interesting that you're saying, you have to remind people of who Kamala Harris is.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"We're just, our job is to be on the ground, on the doors, on the phones, at events, everywhere we can be, where voters will be to remind them of the importance of this election and the importance of their vote and the need to vote for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"This poll reveals a shift, as Harris gains a slight advantage, showing how fluid Michigan's voter base can be.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"With Harris slightly ahead, Michigan remains a battleground that could shift either way.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1,0
"I don't know how Kamala Harris comes off as relatable to anybody, especially those who go out and are planning on voting for her because it's all about the race and gender card.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1

"It's exactly what she goes on to do, uh, during her rally says a rally for Kamala Harris in Detroit, Michigan on Wednesday reportedly ended in disaster with thousands stranded while certain staffers were brought to tears.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"And here's what we'll watch here, this is Kamala Harris with Breitbart news saying temper temper the source from C-SPAN.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1,0
"She hates this, she hates that she has to try to speak over people that she views as less than her.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"Yeah, there's some things that need to be changed, but Kamala's going to do that. She's going to make the changes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
And I'm also really excited to be out here supporting Kamala Harris for president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
I think that's definitely one of the top things that she should do when she gets elected.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
What do you think Kamala should do first if she gets elected: she'll know what to do.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
She didn't even really have a good answer.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"Her answer was not good, basically, she just uses the talking points of the same talking points that everybody else has, which is she's a liar, and I don't like it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"And then you ask them, well, what's going on with the country, how's it going, well, not very good, but, well, then why are you voting and what's her name: look at all these people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
Kamala is going to save us.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"I agree, and she's got to win.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
She's got to win for our country.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
I'm worried about it even when she wins.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
And I just feel Kamala just has that spark that we need as a country to bring everybody together.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"So it's more she's good, not as much.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"Well, I'm excited to see Obama, of course, like why not: and we're very excited to support Vice President Harris because we need strong leadership.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"And that is something that probably does need to be to change, and I think a lot of that, especially when it comes to, you know, the Harris administration, they look, they're going to look for ways to make things easier to access for everyday people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
Harris is getting about 7% of Republicans.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
"So there's no real clear leader with independents, but numerically, Harris has this slight higher number there.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"But among likely voters, Harris is plus six, 50% to 44% with women.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"I think this explains a lot about why Democrats are so nervous, right: like, Harris was supposed to rebuild this coalition from Obama to, you know, kind of wash away the fears about Joe Biden.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"And, you know, she's not really sort of running away with it in a way that, you know, there's concerns about black men voting, there's concerns about Arab Americans in Michigan, and it just means that, at the very end, you're gonna have Democrats, and Republicans, but Democrats do, very nervous at the end.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"So Saturday, Kamala Harris is going to be campaigning in a rally in Kalamazoo, trying to utilize a college town, Western Michigan University, with some special help from former First Lady Michelle Obama.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"And so Harris is really trying to appeal to those voters, you know, certainly now in West Michigan, but she's spent a lot of time here in metro Detroit.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
Harris has gone on several radio shows that are pretty popular in metro Detroit like the Breakfast Club.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
She's she's been making a pretty direct appeals to that subset of voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"And one of the main leaders of this is US Rep Rashida to leave who prominent Democrat from Detroit has not said who she's voting for president which is something that I think looms over, over the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
Organizing and brushing up on their talking points are how these Chicago volunteers for Kamala Harris are spending their day.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
Harris and Walz were here on Wednesday as well so it's quite obvious that they see Michigan as a primary state that they need to woo and they recognize that it is blue now from the governor on down and they are probably going to schedule a lot more visits to Michigan between now and November.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"And right now Kamala Harris shows a lead in Michigan according to the RealClearPolitics average, it shows her with a two and a half point lead although I think it's tighter than that because there's just one throwaway poll in there that shows her with an 11 point lead I don't think anybody believes that, you don't, I don't.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"I believe from what I'm hearing is people want to hear them talk about the issues, the issues that are impacting their lives, how much they're paying for groceries, how much they're paying for gas, for small business owners here in Michigan, how difficult it is to start and continue a small business especially now with these minimum wage and tip mandates coming down in February and Michigan and so I think that so-called honeymoon period with Harris will wear off, people are going to want to hear how their lives are going to be better over the next four years with either of these candidates.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"Look, if you look at, look, too much of this conversation, by the way, is asymmetrical, right: it's all about Harris and what she's got to do.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
So bringing Barack Obama here where he can try to fill that space while Vice President Harris is doing interviews today can try to get voters capitalizing on the moment they can vote now.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
"You have the former president in downtown Detroit, whereas vice president Kamala Harris will be in Grand Rapids and then in the suburban areas of the Detroit metro area.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
The first polling since the convention of 800 likely voters in Michigan finds that fully 50% of those asked said they would vote for Vice President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"Happening this morning, early voting is set to begin in Detroit today with the polls opening at 9 a.m. And it is in the Motor City where Kamala Harris is also today meeting with faith leaders in hopes of shoring up their support.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"So it's extremely close, perhaps Kamala Harris is just a step behind.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"In Detroit last week, Harris did not address Gaza.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"She highlighted Republican efforts to restrict abortion, which has been a winning issue for Democrats.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Nope, not Kamala Harris, this is bad news folks.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"And of course, you know, there's actually those polls out there that say that Kamala Harris is winning all these states.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
She's really not gaining votes because we're actually going to be diving in to the polling in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"Yeah, this is not a good sign for her votes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
And the reason why a Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney is endorsing Kamala Harris is because they want the wars.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
This world is on the brink right now under the Harris Biden administration.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"Xi Jinping, Putin, they don't have any respect whatsoever for Biden and Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"And by the way, guys, Biden's not running his country.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"His wife, Jill Biden, was actually heading the cabinet meeting and I don't know if Biden wasn't really there. I don't think he was.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"Nobody elected Jill Biden, but she's running the show.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"This is how bad it is, though, for Kamala Harris in Michigan with Muslims.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
She's not in first place.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
She's not in second place.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
She is in third place with Muslims in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"This is not good, this is definitely not good news for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"And really, guys, it's really because of somebody's polls right here like Maris and Quinnipiac saying that Harris is up plus five.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
I don't believe she's going to win Michigan with that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
Kamala Harris is not reaching Biden numbers.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"It was 2.8, 2.8, and if you actually look at this, yeah, Michigan not looking very good for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"I mean, Kamala Harris has done is she actually loses Michigan because there's no doubt about it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"Voting's already started, i've already debated twice, i won twice, kamala Harris, she knows she's losing. She knows that, forget what the polls say, man.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
We always hear about Harris having to defend her blue wall and of course Michigan is a major part of that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
She doesn't have the record to run on. I think that's been hurting her.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"And Selena, first and foremost, we saw Harris there as she has on stage today with Liz Cheney lean into this idea and this messaging to disaffected Republican voters to try to bring them into the Democratic fold and try to run up the numbers with that demographic specifically in some of those key swing states like Michigan, where she has been, like Wisconsin, where she's going.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"But today she's saying to those voters that even if they are anti-abortion rights, they should still vote for Vice President Harris because those abortion bans have gone too far.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"But overall, the Harris campaign views all of the polling as pretty much the same since the start, which is that this is an extremely tight race.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"Following the president's announcement, much of Michigan's top Democratic leaders are also putting their support behind Vice President Harris for that nomination.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Following President Joe Biden's exit from the presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris quickly racking up endorsements from a number of top Michigan Democrats. And she was part of that ticket.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"If anything, and some of the issues, especially regarding the automobile industry, she's further left than where Joe Biden was.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
I think she will be a strong candidate.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
I think she'll be a great president of the United States.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, a close ally of Biden during his race, acknowledged her personal choice is not necessarily set just yet.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
"I'm not going anywhere, so what should Harris be looking forward to win Michigan: quite frankly, I want to see someone who cares about the Heartland, who understands the battleground state, who's going to work hard to bring people together, who's going to care about our economy fighting for working men and women.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
Maybe this isn't all roses and ginger snaps for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"Yes, Kamala Harris is leading in Michigan, but by a fraction of a point.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"Well, the Harris campaign quickly turning the former president's remarks into campaign ads.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
Everyone is well aware of the former president's comments and the response is coming from the Harris campaign.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"And so even if we're the only ones and our people understand that that might be the case, the only movement, the only organization that abandons Harris, we will do it regardless of consequence.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
And obviously there was some overlap between the uncommitted movement and what was initially the abandoned Biden movement that's now the abandoned Harris movement.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"So can you explain to our audience what is the difference between the uncommitted movement and then the idea of abandoned Harris: so the critical difference that I would say between both is that we believe our leverage comes from punishing, ensuring the defeat of those who have violated the civil rights of innocent people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"People from all backgrounds, African American, Latino, Gen Z, people from all ages, religions, Hindu, Christian, Jewish, Muslim are part of the abandoned Biden and now abandoned Harris movement.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
Harris is going to continue the same exact policies under Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
They all want the Biden-Harris administration to get much tougher with Israel and try harder to stop the civilian deaths.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
Online ads try to emphasize Kamala Harris' understanding of the civilian cost of this conflict. But Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan want her to lay out a Middle East strategy that differs from Joe Biden's.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
Backing his call for cease fires in Gaza and Lebanon is not enough for her to win back some crucial Michigan voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"Which gives you the most optimism for the next four years for your business: i really support Kamala Harris and the $50,000 that she's proposing to give to startups.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1

Harris has an 8-point advantage here.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1

"Amongst registered voters, the numbers are a bit less beneficial for Kamala Harris, but amongst likely voters, her lead expands.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,1
And so at large here Kamala Harris holds roughly a one point advantage amongst key state likely voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
What they're finding here is that Kamala Harris is up by four.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"In Michigan, they're finding that Kamala Harris leads by roughly two points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"Because I do think what we have found between Georgia and Michigan is that should Michigan start to revert away from Kamala Harris, like we've been seeing over the past week and Georgia starts to inch closer to her, it's a possibility that, especially maybe not this cycle, but in future cycles, because Michigan is becoming a state that has a higher concentration of non-college-educated white voters that tend to be the strongest base for the Republican Party in comparison to states like Georgia, where you're starting to see an increase of white college-educated voters and voters of color across the state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"As of right now, Kamala Harris holds a narrow advantage, but ultimately still a close race.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
"Beyond that, though, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, that's enough for Kamala Harris to win the election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"But it's definitely pleasant news for the Kamala Harris campaign where they previously were thinking, no data points between now and the election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"And Kamala Harris, unsurprisingly, is maintaining that average in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"In so far as it's not usually close, Harris leads by 51 to 43 and critically in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1

"They're mostly not with Kamala, because of what Biden has been doing and having been supporting that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
This has been consistent where Vice President Harris has had a lead on values and that's starting to expand a little bit.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
47 percent of the group said they trust Vice President Kamala Harris more and that's not it.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"A part of the group Harris was hoping to connect with, I think it’s really important that she reaches out to them. She’s done a really good job engaging hundreds of our neighbors at State University on Sunday, ahead of Tuesday’s election, addressing key demographics in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
Some of us need a different voice; it's been lacking.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1

Harris's job in Michigan is to try and match what Joe Biden did.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
"If Harris is doing above 9.3, that could be a sign that maybe her voter turnout was up and she is overperforming what we many expected in the state of Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,0
Michigan had about a two-point lead for Kamala Harris just a few weeks ago.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1
"The polling error advantage, this one I was very tricky on because from 2012 to 2020, it was a very narrow advantage actually for Kamala Harris where the Democrat was up by 0.56%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1
"That is certainly a benefit for Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
"And I think Kamala Harris, she's not going to do, she's not going to be bad enough, like Hillary Clinton was in the state of Michigan in 2016, where it's 47.3%. I don't think she's going to go quite that low.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,-1,1

A problem they did a few months ago and the other tell there is Alyssa Slockin who's running for Senate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
Is that a warning to Vice President Harris: It could be. And it's about how President Harris is going to able to overcome this.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"Hey Adrian, well Vice President Kamala Harris came out and within the first five minutes of her being on stage she addressed the Arab American community and we have been reporting about the Arab American community here in Michigan and that they feel like they have been forgotten by the Democratic Party because of the Biden-Harris administration support of Israel's war in Gaza.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"Lots of people out and excited to see Harris and most of the people actually raised their hand when Harris asked them if they had already early voted and we know in Michigan so far there have been records broken just yesterday over 147,000 people voted here in this state but Harris talked about a lot of different things during her speech.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
Now we heard her regular talking points that she does at all the other rallies but she also really talked to a Gen Z because that is who she's talking to at this rally.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
She is really trying to court the college student vote.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0,0
She spoke about how she loves Gen Z and how she also wants to work with them on climate change.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
She talked to them about how they're the generation that grew up having active shooter drills and also that they're the group that will have less rights than their mothers and grandmothers before them.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1,0
She actually went to a church service and then she went on to a small local business and then which she actually went to a chicken and waffle restaurant that's owned by a former Detroit Lions player and then she went on to a barbershop in a predominantly black neighborhood because she was really trying to get out the black vote there because we have seen her try to court those voters and we've actually seen her in her support increase over the last few months.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
Since August she's actually jumped up about 18 points when it comes to the support from black voters in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1,1
So in Michigan about 13% of the voting population here is black voters and about 84% of them say they're team Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0,1

"They didn't have the cover that they had when the Democrats rather didn't have the cover they had when Joe Biden was the nominee, that he is nominally Catholic, that he goes to Mass on Sundays.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
Kamala Harris is not seemingly practicing anything.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1
"She's nominally Christian, i'm not sure if she goes to church on a regular basis.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1

"She needs to be far, far more willing, her campaign needs to be far, far more willing to say the way we've approached the issue does not necessarily seem to be working, because you're saying that you are working around the clock for a ceasefire for months and there's nothing to show for it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0,-1

"The campaign, VP Harris, the administration, they have repeatedly said to us that they actually don't want us to mobilize their people, that they're willing to put those votes on the table.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
"Do you have a theory on why that support isn't stronger given everything that the Biden Harris administration has done for unions: well, I think at a time, Alex, of massive income and wealth inequality, at a time when 60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck, at a time when we have a broken, very expensive health care system, time when we're the only major country not to provide medical and family leave, at a time when we have more income and wealth inequality than we've ever had.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1
"And it sort of begs the question, is it something else, is it actually independent of Joe Biden's record: i'm going to just take Harris out of the equation here, given Joe Biden was only getting 50% of their support.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1

Meanwhile, the economy is struggling, and the border remains a significant issue with people entering the country illegally, often without any verification of who they are. The average middle-class American isn't focused on January 6th; they want to know how to make their dollars stretch further.

"But speaking of Michigan, since you know that state, I imagine almost as well as you do any other state at this point in the United States, you've been spending a lot of time there this year as part of an attempt to understand how this crucial voting bloc in Michigan, other states as well, but particularly Michigan, which are Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, are thinking about the US support for the role, for the Israeli War in Gaza, for Israel in general, that has been supported basically limitlessly by Joe Biden and now by Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1,-1

By voting for a presidential candidate who is against the war and by rejecting a presidential candidate and by defeating her because she is supporting the genocide.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
We need to defeat Harris in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1,-1
