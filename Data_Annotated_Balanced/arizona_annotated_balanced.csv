"Let's say Trump only wins, or Arizona excuse me, only votes 2% to the right of the popular vote.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1,1
Well Trump would then win the state by 0.2% if the numbers remained the same.,Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1,1
Some key counties I'm watching in the state of Arizona it all begins and ends with Maricopa County this is a county that was reliable Republican in 2012 and even before that in 2016 Trump won it by 2.8% he won statewide by a little under 4% of the vote in 2020 Joe Biden wins this county by 2.2% and Biden wins this state by just 0.3% of the vote.,Donald Trump,Arizona,1,0,0
If Trump is going to win the state of Arizona he either needs to do way better everywhere else like drastically better and keep Maricopa County at 2.2 or Trump needs to get this number at 2.2% slightly smaller than what it is.,Donald Trump,Arizona,0,1,0
So Trump's number one target has to be Maricopa County in Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona,0,1,0
Another county I'm watching is Yuma County not as big population as Maricopa it was 12.6 in 2012 for Romney 1.1 for Trump in 2016 6.2 for Trump in 2020 I'm interested in the margins here because for Trump if Trump is not able to improve in Maricopa he needs to do better in a county like Yuma where he did go up five points from 16 to 20 up to 6.2 but if Trump is not doing better in Maricopa this 6.2 needs to become like plus 10 or plus 9 to make up enough votes to try and counterbalance Maricopa so Yuma is what I'm watching for for the margins I know it'll go for Trump I'm watching for the margins on that one.,Donald Trump,Arizona,0,0,0
Navajo County the final county I'm looking at 7.9 for Romney in 2012 10.2 for Trump in 2016 8.3 for Trump in 2020 again another smaller county we fully expect to go for Donald Trump but what is the percentage margin of victory in that county where again if Maricopa is staying the same or only budging a bit you have to look at a county like this and say okay can Trump make up the votes in a county like Navajo and by how much this is one I'm very much closely watching.,Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1,1

"And so right now, Kamala Harris receiving these endorsements is really, really good news.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1

This Republican mayor from Arizona spoke at a Kamala Harris rally saying that these voters that are in the center owe absolutely nothing to the Republican Party.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,0
"It is that line of messaging that allows Kamala Harris to use these people to her advantage, to show that a lot of these people, beyond her own experience as a state attorney general of a border state, she has people who can speak to their own personal relationships with border police, their own personal relationships with the southern border, and why they believe that Kamala Harris is the best one for the job.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"But what we are noticing is that over time, the numbers are getting better for Kamala Harris on the issue of immigration.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"And to be quite honest, when you're looking at a lot of these topics, defense, immigration compounded together, there are not many other issues that Kamala Harris falls behind on.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"I mean, we are seeing that Kamala Harris could very well turn around perceptions on many different topics, including immigration, right before November.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"But doing a service to Democrats up and down the ballot, including her own, in states like Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California even, and some of these down-ballot races.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"She certainly doesn't win Texas, but she comes into a point where Arizona is far more within reach than where it was before.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"And if she continues this momentum and continues to reel in endorsements, continues to build up this very large pool of people, especially in states like Arizona, where they love people like Senator John McCain.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"That rally clip of Republicans and the Republican mayor of Mesa, Arizona endorsing Kamala Harris has now been viewed 10 million times across platforms by the Kamala Harris campaign and many other surrogates that are platforming these clips.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1
They're getting it to swing voters.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
"When people who know this immigration crisis the best are saying that Kamala Harris is the best person for the job, that is something that resonates with voters.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"Kamala Harris shatters that with this new endorsement, with many other endorsements, and it is only going to continue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1,1
And it all seems to be benefiting Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1
I hope that it's gonna be Kamala and Walz.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
I think Kamala Harris and her VP pick are much more hopeful and positive for everybody.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1,1
The Harris actually wants to do something for a country and I'm excited about them.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"Absolutely, absolutely she can take the state.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1

Harris reiterates there was a bipartisan border enforcement bill.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,0
"And Alex, we saw the vice president today in Arizona talk about if elected, she would create a bipartisan council of advisors in effort to reach Republicans, a big country over party push from her as well.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1

"I mean, she understands this isn't her best issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1
"She's going to do more, she's going to continue to do more.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0

They just announced Kamala and she's going to continue to reach out to Latino men where they are and talk about the issues that they care about most.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
There was this long awaited moment on the campaign trail when President Obama would actually start getting out there for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,0
"And with Kamala Harris and all her qualifications and achievements, it is unfortunately a little bit harder for her to make the case with just a sliver of men.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1
Tomorrow is a huge day for the Kamala Harris campaign.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
Some local high-profile Republicans are calling on voters to make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States for a simple reason.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"Mayor Giles believes that Harris will advocate for middle class Americans, make sure billionaires pay their share of taxes and secure the southern border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"She's no stranger to the notion of these transnational gangs, you know, drug importation, human trafficking, things of this nature. She's prosecuted a lot of these kinds of things.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"But it's not good enough that Harris is going to the border in Arizona finally, because she needs to say the right things while she's there.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
And Harris is getting 92% of Democratic votes.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1
So definitely we're seeing Harris have an advantage among women.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
So Harris is getting the women vote by six points.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1
"And so if I'm the Harris campaign, I need to make inroads into this economic issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
"You know, whether it's on Social Security, whether it's on caregiving, I noticed she had a big, you know, proposal on caregiving, have Medicare cover in-home care.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
And so I think it's smart on the Harris's campaign's part to be leaning into this idea of how do we take care of our older parents.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
Harris's approval as vice president is 44 percent.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
"But when you look at Arizona's numbers compared to the ones from perhaps the Blue Wall, other Midwest states, does anything stick out to you as differences: well, I mean, I think we are seeing we had a Pennsylvania poll out last week and Harris had a two point lead here.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
She's she's behind by two points.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1
And so Harris does have the opportunity to win this state.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1

Your money you keep it the inflation the 26% inflation that the Biden-Harris administration caused is theft. It is an unfair taxation on your families, and you all feel it.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1,-1
They actually have Harris ahead by two points as well.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1

"We've got to build more houses, first of all, which means stopping Kamala Harris's ridiculous regulations.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1

So what I'm saying is for a state like Arizona if the popular vote is only 1.8% lead for Harris while the popular vote does not elect the president it may be a sign that Harris is not faring too well in a lot of the battleground states which are expected to vote more Republican or more Democrat depending than the popular vote it depends on the state.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1

"You're paying higher taxes, you're paying higher grocery prices, you're getting worse jobs with lower wages, but the government bureaucrats who work for Kamala Harris, they're doing just fine.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1
"And here I am, I'm going to say about Kamala Harris, that every time she gives an interview, we gain about 100,000 votes.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"But unfortunately, Kamala Harris runs from the American media just as much as she runs from her own policy.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1
"So unfortunately, she's not going to help us out.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1

And you know what a Kamala Harris gaffe is: it's when she accidentally tells the truth.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,-1
"Well, what would you have done differently over the last four years? And Kamala Harris says, nothing comes to mind.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1,-1

She's been attacking her fellow citizens for daring to think that she has done a bad job.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1
"They say that, you know, we're, they'll say that, well, the Kamala Harris campaign is the campaign of joy.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
But there's no joy when Kamala Harris's boss caused half of America garbage for thinking that they're doing a bad job.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1
There's no joy when Kamala Harris calls the opposition fascists and Nazis for daring to think that Kamala Harris ought to actually do her job rather than just talking about doing her job.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1
What he's really saying is that the American people are bad people for disagreeing with Tim Walz and Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1

Both of the presidential candidates here in the Sunbelt Western States today Arizona here where we expect shortly to see Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
You could practically smell her desperation coming from a mile away.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1
"I don't care what kind of poll you managed to look up on Google, it's pretty obvious what she's trying to do in Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0

And you know what's funny about this is that apparently she's trying to introduce a bill that quote-unquote fixes the border problem.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,0

"Boy, we would have to see some crazy deviation deviation for Kamala Harris to win this election.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1,-1
And I just think the reality is that we have seen a movement towards Vice President Harris among these kind of former disaffected Republican types.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1
But you can sense that there is real potential ground to be tilled here for the Harris campaign.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1
The Harris campaign knows it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
"Yeah, and so I want to talk about exactly that, because, you know, look, it's not often that Kamala Harris is going to bring like a special guest with her on the campaign trail.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
"Obviously, somebody that she's going to do that with is going to have outsized importance.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
"And so the campaign recognizes that as Plouffe has said, and, and Kamala Harris is doing well with them.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1,1
And she continues to grow her vote share among Nikki Haley voters.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,1,1
And so I think that explains why she's out there today.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,0
"Like you could, you know, you could tell when people are faking that, you know, and she's very much not.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1
"And I just think that Kamala Harris wants to make sure she gets every single one of those, like votes.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
And I think that's a good kind of target demo for her to kind of squeeze out a couple more votes as we're looking at a really close race.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"How is her being on the campaign trail with Kamala going to  confer some huge benefit to the Harris campaign, what would you say to that: yeah, I get that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"Like if she can, as many of those voters, she can pull over huge plus for Kamala.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"And then the other thing I just want to observe today, there is another criticism, which you didn't ask, but I'm going to ask it and knock it down myself, which is progressive folks are like, should she be campaigning with Liz: like people don't like a lot of the Republican like conservative policies that Liz has pushed.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,-1,-1
"On stage today, like Liz almost sounded like Kamala is kind of bringing out Liz's inter-liberal.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,0
"Having these people, you know, basically start the conversation with Democrats like Kamala Harris will give a permission structure for a lot of these Republican voters out there to know that it is okay to like kind of like as a gateway to, it is okay to vote for Democrats and the policies that Democrats are espoused are not going to lead to the end of the world.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"And so when you, when you break that, like, you know, if Kamala and Liz Cheney being together can get some people to break out of that mindset, it does, you know, create an openness to rethinking certain issues and being more open to like the progressive point of view on certain issues.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"But even back to her CNN interview opportunistic economy, she still hasn't explained that like what is that: chris Bird came into the debate leaning towards Harris but still has questions about what her economic plan actually is.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1
"Harris meantime stating if Congress brought forward a national bill on abortion access, she would quote, proudly sign it into law.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
"So immigration, Erin, has been kind of a liability for Vice President Kamala Harris as she's running for president now.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1
"Is it possible to make a dent in that by visiting Douglas? Well, I just wonder what Republicans are going to talk about once she's gone to the border, because that's been the biggest talking point is where she's been, what she's doing.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
"I think she has a really good answer on this, which is they tried to get something done politically that would have actually solved the problem.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
But I think she's at least kind of fighting to a draw.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1
"Matt, safe to say Republicans will find something to talk about on immigration, even if Harris is at the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,0
I think every minute she spends talking about illegal immigration and border security is a lost opportunity for her because the record that the Biden and Harris administration have on this issue is so abysmal.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1
I think they want to feel like Harris cares about this issue.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1
"We see that polling again and again and again, i think she tries to check the box and kind of get over that and neutralize it a little bit.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1
"Some of the polling numbers on the economy, she's come way back.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1
"It's been really interesting to see, she's kind of got that to an even.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
And I hope she'll squeak by just like President Biden did here in Arizona.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
She's showing that she cares about it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1,1
"The reality of the situation is I think she's trying to get it to closer to neutral, to your point, and then give people permission to vote for her.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,0
"If this gets them over that hurdle, it could be the difference in her winning Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1,1
We've seen polls that show Vice President Harris up by a couple.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1
And I think Harris has a chance.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"Harris has actually been running from an economic perspective, a much more conservative campaign than Biden was.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1
She's not talking about wealth taxes and all those other things.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,0
She's talking about a tax cut for 100 million Americans.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1
"She's talking about, I think there was a whole thing on starting small businesses and tax credits.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"She's actually playing more of that centrist economic music right now than Joe Biden was, for whatever reason.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,0
But I think she definitely has a chance.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"But man, people seem to have really made up their minds about her.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,-1
"And she has just bled a lot of support among the old McCain voters, of which there are many.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1,-1
"And so that is really hurting her, and Ruben Gallego has run a smart campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,-1,-1
She'll be here at Cochise College in Douglas.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
"Now they all traversed through Mexico to get to our back door, but law enforcement down here, say Vice President Kamala Harris, was virtually hands off on the issue and really downplayed the crisis.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1
They've kept detention at a minimum.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,0
They have leaned heavily on parole programs as legal pathways and they've provided millions of federal funding to volunteer groups.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"Now Marnie, you heard from Sheriff Daniels there who has been extending the invitation to Vice President Harris for three and a half years.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,0
"But Kamala Harris is debuting a new ad today talking about border security, talking about that she's going to enforce the law.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,1,1
"She's going to secure the border, different things like that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1,1
Now she's also expected to talk about fighting the flow of fentanyl and getting additional screening machines for the ports of entry and things like that to double down on preventing that deadly drug from getting into the nation.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0,1
I don't think that these are positive trends for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,1,-1
"So there's a larger margin of error here, but we see that Harris is ahead by about 68%.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
We're going to need to see that early vote tick up and Democrats turn out more for that early vote if Harris is going to be competitive on election day because we're likely to see more Republicans vote then.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,0
That divide isn't quite what Harris would want it to be though.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1,-1
"Right now, we're not seeing that, we're seeing it get close, very close, very competitive, but she really needs to run that up a little bit more, especially heading into in-person election day.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1
She needs to run up that score if she's going to remain competitive here.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1
So it's likely that folks are tying her to the Biden administration.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,-1
"She is a vice president, so rightfully so.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,0
"But otherwise, there's very little to point to as far as why she's not getting more sizable margins among women and why she's losing a little bit of ground among men.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1
Harris has done a good job of capitalizing on that housing affordability issue.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"That's not equal across these states, but we do see that she's doing well among the 18 to 29 demographic.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"So, you know, I think that it is a potentially good sign for Harris here that Josh Stein has mounted a significant lead over Robinson.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"But I don't know that that necessarily translates to Stein pulling up Harris, so to speak.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,0
"But whether that boosts Harris, I'm not sure.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,1,0
"So what does this tell us about down-ballot Democrats trying to distance themselves from Kamala Harris: yeah, that's interesting.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,0
"So, you know, any sort of defection that Harris gets from some of these minority voters, that's really going to hurt her on election day.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1
"Vice President Kamala Harris will continue to undermine her record on Friday, this time on the issue of immigration during remarks in Douglas, Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1
Harris faces a conundrum.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,-1
"She cannot campaign on policies to fix crime, inflation, and border security without undermining the Biden-Harris administration's policies.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,-1

More on Harris' scant plan to secure the border is here.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
It is not clear if Harris will take any questions while in Arizona.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1

Kamala Harris will be visiting the southern border that she has completely destroyed from what I understand tomorrow.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1
"Why would she go to the border now playing right into the hand of her opponent, i mean you take a look at this why would you do that: there can be no justification for what she's done.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1
Harris has received criticism for not visiting the border more during her time in office and this is her first visit to the border since 2021 but the campaign believes they have a winning message launching new ads in Arizona and other battleground states highlighting her plans which are some of the toughest positions on the issue for many Democratic candidate in decade.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,1,0

Senator Jeff Flake's decision to endorse Kamala Harris comes at a time where the polling is showing Arizona has become an increasingly more positive race for the former president as the data shows a slight uptick in support from the moments around Kamala Harris' announcement of Tim Walz as vice president at the Democratic National Convention.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"Jeff Flake, as the most recently elected Republican to the United States Senate, not recently elected, actually recently served Republican, he endorsing Kamala Harris is something that is pretty substantive.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1

I don't know much about Vice President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0,-1
Important enough that John McCain's son is endorsing Kamala Harris explicitly.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"And so when we take a look at what's happening in the state of Arizona, and it isn't just there too, right: you're seeing that the Mesa mayor, John Giles, endorsed Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"That matters, you know, this is something that I think we have come to see is becoming a more common trend line among some Republicans who were a bit on the fence after 2020 and the January 6th insurrection that are now coming into 2024 with a rebound vision that now it's time to endorse the Democrat for the first time in their political careers.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
And Republicans across the state and across the country have also been pretty supportive of Vice President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1
"There are representatives, there are governors, there are many members, former RNC chair people, right. You are talking about people who served and represented the national Republican party that are now endorsing Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1,1

It's always useful to sort of compare and contrast because I feel bad sometimes for anybody who's listening to Kamala Harris's interviews because there's no specifics.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1,-1
"All right, so Kamala Harris's economic plan is to wage war on American energy, drive up the cost of oil, drive up the cost of natural gas, and drive up the cost of everything that requires low energy costs, which is everything that we buy, from the homes that we buy to the food that gets delivered to the grocery store.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1

Kamala Harris is obsessed with silencing her fellow citizens.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1
What you've seen under Secretary Raimondo and Kamala Harris is them trying to say that you're only going to get money to manufacture chips if you do what we want you to do politically.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1,-1
But this thing you see with Kamala Harris where she says we're going to hold your government funding hostage unless you agree with our politics.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,-1,-1
