"But I think the rubber is going to hit the road and the race is going to look a lot more realistic, I think, come mid September right in there once this race kind of settles down and these campaigns hunker in, because that's the only thing the polling showed is that, you know, with on the issues, Trump is doing better on some of the key issues that Arizona voters care most about, such as pocketbook issues and immigration.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1

In 2016 the state of Arizona was won by Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by 3.5% of the vote.,Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"Let's say Trump only wins, or Arizona excuse me, only votes 2% to the right of the popular vote.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,-1
Well Trump would then win the state by 0.2% if the numbers remained the same.,Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
Some key counties I'm watching in the state of Arizona it all begins and ends with Maricopa County this is a county that was reliable Republican in 2012 and even before that in 2016 Trump won it by 2.8% he won statewide by a little under 4% of the vote in 2020 Joe Biden wins this county by 2.2% and Biden wins this state by just 0.3% of the vote.,Donald Trump,Arizona,0,0
If Trump is going to win the state of Arizona he either needs to do way better everywhere else like drastically better and keep Maricopa County at 2.2 or Trump needs to get this number at 2.2% slightly smaller than what it is.,Donald Trump,Arizona,0,0
So Trump's number one target has to be Maricopa County in Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona,0,0
Another county I'm watching is Yuma County not as big population as Maricopa it was 12.6 in 2012 for Romney 1.1 for Trump in 2016 6.2 for Trump in 2020 I'm interested in the margins here because for Trump if Trump is not able to improve in Maricopa he needs to do better in a county like Yuma where he did go up five points from 16 to 20 up to 6.2 but if Trump is not doing better in Maricopa this 6.2 needs to become like plus 10 or plus 9 to make up enough votes to try and counterbalance Maricopa so Yuma is what I'm watching for for the margins I know it'll go for Trump I'm watching for the margins on that one.,Donald Trump,Arizona,0,0
Navajo County the final county I'm looking at 7.9 for Romney in 2012 10.2 for Trump in 2016 8.3 for Trump in 2020 again another smaller county we fully expect to go for Donald Trump but what is the percentage margin of victory in that county where again if Maricopa is staying the same or only budging a bit you have to look at a county like this and say okay can Trump make up the votes in a county like Navajo and by how much this is one I'm very much closely watching.,Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1

That's interesting to hear how there's this divergence in how people Republican voters specifically see Kerry Lake versus Trump in a state like Arizona.,Donald Trump,Arizona,-1,-1

"Outside of that, every other pollster except two, which is Bloomberg and Atlas Intel, which we'll get to that in a second, every other pollster has Trump winning Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
And it's not just the polls have Trump up by just one point.,Donald Trump,Arizona,1,0
"No, no, the majority of the polls have Trump winning Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"They have him up by two, even five points in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"Meanwhile, CBS news insider advantage, they found Trump up by three.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,0
"So when you factor in what data orbital found, which was Trump plus eight, you're talking about four polls right now that has Trump up by three or more in Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"Trump plus three and a half, yeah, we have Trump plus three, Trump plus four out of Arizona from, from Atlas Intel, which most people would agree is one of the best pollsters out there.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
So that means you have five polls right now that has Trump winning Arizona by at least three points.,Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
They're all showing Trump's up by at least three points to at most eight points.,Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"Yet you look inside the poll and they have Trump winning independence, which is just crazy because if Trump wins independence in Arizona, he's winning, he's winning the state by five points at a bare minimum.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"Literally every other pollster has Trump up in Arizona by two, three, even five to eight points as of now.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1

Trump is going to win Arizona if the election was held today.,Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
He's actually winning Arizona by four to five points.,Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"That's what happened, and there's a good chance that when the wall street journal and the CNN poll, when they're kicked off the average, probably not the CNN poll, but the wall street journal, there's a good chance that when they include Atlas Intel's brand new poll, you're probably talking about Trump plus two, Trump plus three, maybe Trump plus four.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"And that's a stretch, but if there are other good polls for Trump out there in Arizona, there's a chance he could be up by three to four points by election day, which I know sounds crazy because back in 2020, Biden won Arizona.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"So it's crazy to suggest that Trump is not going to just win Arizona, but he's going to win it by like three to four points, which I'm not even saying it's going to for sure happen.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"You have a bunch of polls showing Trump up by three, four, five, seven points in Arizona right now.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
But polls are not the only things suggesting that Trump's going to win Arizona by quite a bit.,Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"We're finding Trump's going to probably win Arizona by like three to four points, maybe by even more.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"If it gets so bad for Democrats, there's a legitimate possibility that Trump could win Arizona by some crazy margin like Trump plus four, Trump plus five, which I'm not saying it's going to happen.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"No, no one should expect that, but if the early voting trends continue and the polls continue trending the way they are, would it really be crazy to suggest that maybe Trump's going to win Arizona by some crazy margin compared to 2020: it's entirely possible.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
Now it does make sense because both these polls have Trump winning Arizona by like four to eight points.,Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"But if Trump really wins Arizona by five, six, seven, eight points, which that's what data orbital is suggesting.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"But if the trends continue and Trump actually wins Arizona by four points, you're talking about 50, 50 race.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"If it's Trump plus five, Carrie Lake is probably the favorite.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"And I still think Ruben Gallego is the favorite, but it's a different story of Trump is really winning by three, four, five points.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"Right now, there's been a bunch of polls out of Arizona showing Trump winning by three, four, five, even eight points.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"And they're both finding Carrie Lake is surging and Trump is having a big margin of victory in Arizona, which is exactly what Lake needed to win.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1
"But if it really is Trump plus four, Trump plus five, like the polls are showing, she could actually win.",Donald Trump,Arizona,1,1

"Meanwhile, Vice President Harris, she talks about the border security plans and passing that Senate bill.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
But she says that the border was secure for four years.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
So she's going to have to convince the American people that she is going to be tougher on the border when millions poured across it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,-1
"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz just wrapped up a raucous campaign rally before more than 15,000 people in Glendale, Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1
And it comes as recent polling from Bloomberg and Morning Consult shows Harris gaining ground in Arizona and Nevada.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"I mean, obviously she's trying to kind of capitalize on the border issue.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
And you've seen as we saw in that video of the Harris Walz rally tonight here in Glendale.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
Does the Harris walls ticket benefit from that crossover vote: most likely.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0
"And before Harris took the stage, her supporters heard speeches from Tucson Mayor Regina Romero, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, Governor Katie Hobbs, Senator Mark Kelly and his wife Gabby Giffords.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
So what I'm saying is for a state like Arizona if the popular vote is only 1.8% lead for Harris while the popular vote does not elect the president it may be a sign that Harris is not faring too well in a lot of the battleground states which are expected to vote more Republican or more Democrat depending than the popular vote it depends on the state.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
Harris's number one target has to be defending Maricopa County and trying to grow on what Biden was able to do in 2020.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"The strategy was, okay, we're going to do the interview like everybody says we have to do, but we're going to do it as little as possible.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"In Arizona, Harris's appeal among women, Latino voters, and young voters has strengthened her standing, contributing significantly to her one-point lead.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Harris's campaign, on the other hand, has concentrated on appealing to women, young voters, and Latino communities through a platform centered on healthcare access, education, and social equity.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
Now Kamala Harris has rolled out the red carpet to every illegal alien.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"She's promised them to give them social security and Medicare, which would bankrupt those programs.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"What are we doing to the veterans, what are we doing for the veterans who are sleeping under park benches and sleeping all over our country, homeless, when we're spending $1.4 billion to look after people who don't have the legal right to be here: that's what Kamala Harris's policies are doing to this country.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
I blame Kamala Harris for letting the illegal immigration problem fester.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Now, one of the biggest problems that comes from illegal immigration and Kamala Harris doesn't like to talk about it and neither of course, does the corporate media who defends her at every step of the way.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"If we have a president like Kamala Harris who gives American homes to illegal aliens instead of American citizens, we are never going to make the American dream of homeownership affordable.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,1
It's what she's offering the state of Arizona is four more years of exactly the same policies that brought us to this situation in the first place.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
It's a vote for four more years of unaffordable groceries and unaffordable housing.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
It's a vote for four more years of a wide open Southern border.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0
It's a vote for four more years of the Fentanyl flooding into our country.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"We do not want more, four more years of Kamala Harris has broken policies.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
Our message to Kamala Harris is you're fired.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1
"Cause of course, under her policies, the price of groceries got way more expensive.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"That is a tough job, now I know, I know that a lot of you've got tough jobs, but you've never had a day at work so bad where you've had to convince the American people that Kamala Harris is fit to be the president of the United States.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Governor Walz's job got a little harder because it turns out yesterday that while Kamala Harris has been going around the country bragging about how good the economy is, it turns out that the American economy last month lost 28,000 private sector jobs.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"You're paying higher taxes, you're paying higher grocery prices, you're getting worse jobs with lower wages, but the government bureaucrats who work for Kamala Harris, they're doing just fine.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"And here I am, I'm going to say about Kamala Harris, that every time she gives an interview, we gain about 100,000 votes.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"But unfortunately, Kamala Harris runs from the American media just as much as she runs from her own policy.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"So unfortunately, she's not going to help us out.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"But a couple of weeks ago, she did us a big favor because she reminded the American people of the lie at the heart of her campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Remember, this is a person who's the sitting vice president and she runs around the country pretending that she has nothing to do with the policies of the administration where she is the vice president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"You'd almost believe that she's never met Joe Biden, even though she is his vice president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
She's bragged about his policies for years and she only changed her tune about a few months ago when she became the Democrat nominee for president.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"But notice, she never talks about what she has done because the actual record is a failure.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"But every now and then, Kamala Harris will commit a gaffe.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
And you know what a Kamala Harris gaffe is: it's when she accidentally tells the truth.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Well, what would you have done differently over the last four years? And Kamala Harris says, nothing comes to mind.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"That means that if you vote for Kamala Harris, you're gonna get more of the same.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
She's been attacking her fellow citizens for daring to think that she has done a bad job.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"They say that, you know, we're, they'll say that, well, the Kamala Harris campaign is the campaign of joy.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
But there's no joy when Kamala Harris's boss caused half of America garbage for thinking that they're doing a bad job.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
There's no joy when Kamala Harris calls the opposition fascists and Nazis for daring to think that Kamala Harris ought to actually do her job rather than just talking about doing her job.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
What he's really saying is that the American people are bad people for disagreeing with Tim Walz and Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
We are not bad people for loving this country enough to think that Kamala Harris ought to do a better job.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
It's so much bigger than just beating Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"I met a woman who is a retiree, and for 40 years, she and her husband have done steak night every Friday, but last year under Kamala Harris's policies because groceries got too expensive, she stopped doing steak night.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1

"I have known Kamala Harris for 16 years, and she is the real deal.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"That's what you do when you're a great mother, and we're going to send her daughter, Kamala Harris, to the White House.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
She's a cracker and the more pressure Kamala has the more you see it happening.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
We need to move past that and that's why she's strongly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris and also LeBron James endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris today as well.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,1
So this is Harris's second visit to Arizona since she took over that Democratic nominee after Biden dropped out of the race.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"Now, as you mentioned, border security and immigration are two topics that are extremely important to our voters, and it appears that they are both the Achilles heel of the Harris campaign heading into the final stages of the race.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"After visiting the border earlier today, someone with the Harris campaign tells us the vice president believes agents there need more resources.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"One who's voting for the very first time, another who believes Harris needs to lay out who she is as a candidate and some of her policies more clearly.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0
"Equal pay and, exactly, do you think and feel she needs to clarify more on what matters: i think she needs to clarify her policy on immigration more and her policy on health care more because I don't think she's really laid that out correctly.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"We're talking about Kamala Harris in the lead in Texas, Georgia, A&D, Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1

"Plus her focus on health care, making it more affordable.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
And Harris talking about voting rights.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"Like when we're talking about immigration reform, climate change, making health care affordable, Harris, she's got plans and people seem to be responding.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"And this little battle they've got going on, it's pushing some Republicans, more moderate ones, you know, the kind who'd usually vote red no matter what they're looking at Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Maybe they don't agree with her on everything, but she seems less extreme.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1
"And the challenge, though, is that it's really hard to have a plan when, as President Biden has said, with 50 senators, with 50 Democratic senators, every single one of them is a president.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1
Christians will not be safe with Kamala Harris as president of the United States.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
And we were basically asking for their support for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
And she will definitely be voting for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
They said that they would vote for Kamala Harris for sure.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
He would vote for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
And definitely voting Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
So that's a big challenge For Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"She needs to win all the core democratic voter groups in addition to 10 to 15 percent of Republicans in Arizona in order to take the state that's because of Republicans general turnout advantage in general elections Bram I know another big debate that we will all be watching is coming up this Wednesday evening It's the US Senate debate between Reuben, Gallego and Kerry Lake.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0

"In Arizona, you see that Kamala Harris is winning in our poll Latino voters by 18 percentage points, 56% to 38%.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"And so Harris, as I said, had an 18-point advantage with Latinos.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
Harris winning women by 16 points.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1

How much longer can Harris ignore this crisis.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1

"We are proud to be here in Arizona, supported by President Harris and Governor Walz.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1

Both of the presidential candidates here in the Sunbelt Western States today Arizona here where we expect shortly to see Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
You could practically smell her desperation coming from a mile away.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"I don't care what kind of poll you managed to look up on Google, it's pretty obvious what she's trying to do in Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"Because if she had any inkling of care about the border, aside from trying to scrounge around for votes, she would have visited the border a hell of a lot sooner than what she did recently.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"It's awesome, to say the least, we're gonna be playing you some footage from Fox News and from the Hannity exclusive, which showcases the border crisis and how Kakamala Harris is trying to handle it, which is to say, not at all.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1
"Like I said at the beginning, if Kakamala Harris wasn't desperate for voters, there's no way she would have visited the border recently.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"He apparently has connections with the governor of Arizona, and he's been doing his best to get Kamala Harris over there, just to see what the border looks like.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"And he stated that although he's glad that she's finally visiting the border, why did it take this long to do it: well it's quite simple really, it's because Kakamala Harris has no value and she doesn't support anything that she says.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
And you know what's funny about this is that apparently she's trying to introduce a bill that quote-unquote fixes the border problem.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"But to end this video on a more positive note, let's take a look at what a lot of people had to say in Arizona about Kakamala Harris' failed attempt for scrounging for voters.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"And that's why you see a Morris with a, you know, just pathetic, horrible poll that has Harris plus five.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"You know, they, they, they should just have Harris winning honestly.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Boy, we would have to see some crazy deviation deviation for Kamala Harris to win this election.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
And I just think the reality is that we have seen a movement towards Vice President Harris among these kind of former disaffected Republican types.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
But you can sense that there is real potential ground to be tilled here for the Harris campaign.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
The Harris campaign knows it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"Yeah, and so I want to talk about exactly that, because, you know, look, it's not often that Kamala Harris is going to bring like a special guest with her on the campaign trail.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"Obviously, somebody that she's going to do that with is going to have outsized importance.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,-1
"And so the campaign recognizes that as Plouffe has said, and, and Kamala Harris is doing well with them.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
And she continues to grow her vote share among Nikki Haley voters.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
And so I think that explains why she's out there today.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"Like you could, you know, you could tell when people are faking that, you know, and she's very much not.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"And I just think that Kamala Harris wants to make sure she gets every single one of those, like votes.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
And I think that's a good kind of target demo for her to kind of squeeze out a couple more votes as we're looking at a really close race.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0
"How is her being on the campaign trail with Kamala going to  confer some huge benefit to the Harris campaign, what would you say to that: yeah, I get that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Like if she can, as many of those voters, she can pull over huge plus for Kamala.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"And then the other thing I just want to observe today, there is another criticism, which you didn't ask, but I'm going to ask it and knock it down myself, which is progressive folks are like, should she be campaigning with Liz: like people don't like a lot of the Republican like conservative policies that Liz has pushed.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"On stage today, like Liz almost sounded like Kamala is kind of bringing out Liz's inter-liberal.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"Having these people, you know, basically start the conversation with Democrats like Kamala Harris will give a permission structure for a lot of these Republican voters out there to know that it is okay to like kind of like as a gateway to, it is okay to vote for Democrats and the policies that Democrats are espoused are not going to lead to the end of the world.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1
"And so when you, when you break that, like, you know, if Kamala and Liz Cheney being together can get some people to break out of that mindset, it does, you know, create an openness to rethinking certain issues and being more open to like the progressive point of view on certain issues.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"But even back to her CNN interview opportunistic economy, she still hasn't explained that like what is that: chris Bird came into the debate leaning towards Harris but still has questions about what her economic plan actually is.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Harris meantime stating if Congress brought forward a national bill on abortion access, she would quote, proudly sign it into law.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"So immigration, Erin, has been kind of a liability for Vice President Kamala Harris as she's running for president now.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Is it possible to make a dent in that by visiting Douglas? Well, I just wonder what Republicans are going to talk about once she's gone to the border, because that's been the biggest talking point is where she's been, what she's doing.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"I think she has a really good answer on this, which is they tried to get something done politically that would have actually solved the problem.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
But I think she's at least kind of fighting to a draw.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0
"Matt, safe to say Republicans will find something to talk about on immigration, even if Harris is at the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
I think every minute she spends talking about illegal immigration and border security is a lost opportunity for her because the record that the Biden and Harris administration have on this issue is so abysmal.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
I think they want to feel like Harris cares about this issue.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"We see that polling again and again and again, i think she tries to check the box and kind of get over that and neutralize it a little bit.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Some of the polling numbers on the economy, she's come way back.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"It's been really interesting to see, she's kind of got that to an even.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
And I hope she'll squeak by just like President Biden did here in Arizona.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
She's showing that she cares about it.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"The reality of the situation is I think she's trying to get it to closer to neutral, to your point, and then give people permission to vote for her.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"If this gets them over that hurdle, it could be the difference in her winning Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
We've seen polls that show Vice President Harris up by a couple.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0
And I think Harris has a chance.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Harris has actually been running from an economic perspective, a much more conservative campaign than Biden was.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1
She's not talking about wealth taxes and all those other things.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
She's talking about a tax cut for 100 million Americans.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0
"She's talking about, I think there was a whole thing on starting small businesses and tax credits.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0
"She's actually playing more of that centrist economic music right now than Joe Biden was, for whatever reason.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
But I think she definitely has a chance.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"But man, people seem to have really made up their minds about her.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0
"And she has just bled a lot of support among the old McCain voters, of which there are many.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"And so that is really hurting her, and Ruben Gallego has run a smart campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
She'll be here at Cochise College in Douglas.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"Now they all traversed through Mexico to get to our back door, but law enforcement down here, say Vice President Kamala Harris, was virtually hands off on the issue and really downplayed the crisis.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
They've kept detention at a minimum.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
They have leaned heavily on parole programs as legal pathways and they've provided millions of federal funding to volunteer groups.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Now Marnie, you heard from Sheriff Daniels there who has been extending the invitation to Vice President Harris for three and a half years.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"But Kamala Harris is debuting a new ad today talking about border security, talking about that she's going to enforce the law.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"She's going to secure the border, different things like that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
Now she's also expected to talk about fighting the flow of fentanyl and getting additional screening machines for the ports of entry and things like that to double down on preventing that deadly drug from getting into the nation.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0
I don't think that these are positive trends for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"So there's a larger margin of error here, but we see that Harris is ahead by about 68%.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
We're going to need to see that early vote tick up and Democrats turn out more for that early vote if Harris is going to be competitive on election day because we're likely to see more Republicans vote then.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
That divide isn't quite what Harris would want it to be though.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Right now, we're not seeing that, we're seeing it get close, very close, very competitive, but she really needs to run that up a little bit more, especially heading into in-person election day.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
She needs to run up that score if she's going to remain competitive here.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
So it's likely that folks are tying her to the Biden administration.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"She is a vice president, so rightfully so.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0

"Vice President Kamala Harris will continue to undermine her record on Friday, this time on the issue of immigration during remarks in Douglas, Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
Harris faces a conundrum.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"She cannot campaign on policies to fix crime, inflation, and border security without undermining the Biden-Harris administration's policies.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
But she must tout the administration's policies to validate her record and candidacy.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"Under the Biden-Harris administration, migrants swamped the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1

We're going to get rid of Kamala and Joe.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
Harris has unleashed on our country can never be allowed to become the president of the United States.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,-1
Kamala Harris' reign of terror ends the day I take the oath of office.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1

"And at the end of the day, I mean, we saw the news hits and all the media with Republicans for Harris out here.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1

"Kamala, shouldn't be running, she shouldn't even be running.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
She didn't get any votes.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
I have a feeling that he would have been tougher than her.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
What Kamala and her radical left cronies have done to the state of Arizona is a crime that can never be forgiven.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"For four straight years, she's imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons all over the world.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
And she's resettled them into your communities to prey upon innocent American people.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"If Kamala gets four more years, the entire country will be turned into a migrant camp.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country is the savage Venezuelan prison gang known as Trenday Aragua.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
But the same amount of time that we heard Vice President Harris talk.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
And she resettles them into your communities to prey upon innocent American people.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1

Vice President Kamala Harris heads to Arizona today for her first visit to the U.S.-Mexico border since launching her campaign two months ago.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
Polls are showing that immigration is one of Harris's most vulnerable issues but she reportedly will propose deploying more border agents and new technology to target the flow of fentanyl across the border.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Now during the visit to Douglas later today she's expected to argue as a former border state prosecutor she's the best one to tackle the issue that it is a quote false choice between securing the border and creating an immigration system that is safe, orderly, and humane and according to a senior administration official who shared these quotes on background given that it is not finalized speech yet she's expected to lay out that setting sovereignty requires rules and a border that is followed as well.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
Kamala Harris will be visiting the southern border that she has completely destroyed from what I understand tomorrow.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Why would she go to the border now playing right into the hand of her opponent, i mean you take a look at this why would you do that: there can be no justification for what she's done.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
Harris has received criticism for not visiting the border more during her time in office and this is her first visit to the border since 2021 but the campaign believes they have a winning message launching new ads in Arizona and other battleground states highlighting her plans which are some of the toughest positions on the issue for many Democratic candidate in decade.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0

He's got Harris up to 58 percent chance.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Vice president Harris is trying to do her job and supporting something, something that senators and congressmen will support.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
And so Kamala Harris has a plan.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,1
She wants to work on Dreamers.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
She wants to work on the 11 million people that are here that have mixed status families.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,1
"So for Kamala Harris, chances are very low to win from Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
And Arizonans consider Kamala as the reason of their miseries.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Arizona suffered high inflation and high cost of living due to the exuberantly high government spendings and adventures, and still Kamala thinks of her victory from Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1
Biden Democrat administration with Kamala as the vice president did not materialize the recovery plan from the pandemic.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
So it's very less likely that Kamala can get a vote from those sending their children to schools.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
The blue collar worker of Arizona received the strongest hit from the cruel Biden policies in connivance with Kamala Harris as the vice president.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"The last three and a half years have been brutal, what do you think about Kamala Harris: i don't know if I should comment on that.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
But Kamala Harris is having a tough time in Arizona.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Big time, she's been able to completely turn a quote, quote, sinking ship into back on track.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
Harris has consolidated the Democratic base.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Harris doing better among black voters than Joe Biden was, a core part of the constituency, so movement there, as well as increased enthusiasm and saying that they're going to turn out.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1

Their billboards are all over the Valley.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Webster still has his differences with Harris, but says he trusts her character.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
Now are there things Kamala Harris has to do for policies I disagree with: absolutely.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"She's a Democrat, but will this Republican to Republican outreach make a difference in what's expected to be a razor thin election in November: it's still a red state and you need Republican crossover votes in order to win longtime Arizona pollster.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,0
"I'm Craig Smith, we're live at Tucson International where we've just watched the landing of Air Force 2 carrying Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0

"On the other hand, Harris's focus on healthcare, education and social justice could turn the tide toward her campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"And today we are going to be talking about Senator Jeff Flake from the state of Arizona, the last Republican senator from this state, now endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States of America.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
Senator Jeff Flake's decision to endorse Kamala Harris comes at a time where the polling is showing Arizona has become an increasingly more positive race for the former president as the data shows a slight uptick in support from the moments around Kamala Harris' announcement of Tim Walz as vice president at the Democratic National Convention.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Jeff Flake, as the most recently elected Republican to the United States Senate, not recently elected, actually recently served Republican, he endorsing Kamala Harris is something that is pretty substantive.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"It's something that I think also too really marks this moment about Arizona, where we recently saw one of the Republican mayors from a border city county, a border city rather, endorse Kamala Harris as well, the Republican mayor of Mesa, Arizona, who actually spoke at an Arizona rally that took place just around a month ago.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"This is again, a number of different factors have come into play with people like Representative Liz Cheney and former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney, who have come out and endorsed Kamala Harris for president of the United States.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"For someone like Kamala Harris, right, the enthusiasm there for Democrats is really high, but amongst Republicans and independents, it's not nearly as high, obviously.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
I don't know much about Vice President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
Important enough that John McCain's son is endorsing Kamala Harris explicitly.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"And so when we take a look at what's happening in the state of Arizona, and it isn't just there too, right: you're seeing that the Mesa mayor, John Giles, endorsed Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"That matters, you know, this is something that I think we have come to see is becoming a more common trend line among some Republicans who were a bit on the fence after 2020 and the January 6th insurrection that are now coming into 2024 with a rebound vision that now it's time to endorse the Democrat for the first time in their political careers.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
And Republicans across the state and across the country have also been pretty supportive of Vice President Harris.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"There are representatives, there are governors, there are many members, former RNC chair people, right. You are talking about people who served and represented the national Republican party that are now endorsing Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
And every piece of the puzzle that lands Kamala Harris to the presidency is something that we can look back on and say that was crucial because clearly all of it was.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
Kamala Harris can't win Arizona and win the election on her own.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"But in winning Arizona, it will likely speak to the electability of Kamala Harris in other surrounding battleground states like Nevada, in Colorado and New Mexico and Texas.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
She'd likely win Nevada in conjunction with Arizona and she'd likely to win the Rust Belt region if she was winning in Arizona as well as Nevada.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Kamala Harris still wins the presidency with a combination of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Republicans in Arizona, some of them, including members of the McCain family, are all in for Vice President Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"After almost four years, borders are Kamala Harris has decided for political reasons that it's time for her to go to the border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,-1
She's gone to the border for years.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,-1
"What a disgrace that is that she waited so long allowing millions and millions of people to enter our country from prisons and jails, mental institutions and insane asylums.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Now when she speaks, I hope everybody remembers that she has caused our cities, our towns and our country itself tremendous damage.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"And I think maybe I'll have to take some to Kamala Harris for every time she does a softball interview, she wants to wear some body armor.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
But they decided to put Kamala Harris out there more and more.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"Now, she's only doing these softball interviews.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"And unfortunately, for Kamala Harris, every time that she does an interview, she makes our case for us.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"That's a pretty easy job, governor Walz has to go around and somehow convince the American people that Kamala Harris is going to solve the very problem she's been creating over the last three and a half years.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1
"But here's the reality, is that under Kamala Harris's policies, she cast trillions, she cast the deciding vote on trillions of dollars of new spending.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"That's over, that's over $12,000 a year, thanks to Kamala Harris's policies, Arizona is dealing with one of the worst housing crisis we've ever seen in this state.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"And thanks to Kamala Harris's policies, Arizona is maybe feeling it the worst, the wide open border, the drugs, the crime, and the sex trafficking.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"And of course, we know that a lot of our senior citizens, the ones who are living on a fixed income, are the ones who have been hit the hardest by Kamala Harris's inflation.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
It's always useful to sort of compare and contrast because I feel bad sometimes for anybody who's listening to Kamala Harris's interviews because there's no specifics.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"All right, so Kamala Harris's economic plan is to wage war on American energy, drive up the cost of oil, drive up the cost of natural gas, and drive up the cost of everything that requires low energy costs, which is everything that we buy, from the homes that we buy to the food that gets delivered to the grocery store.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
Kamala Harris is going around the country bragging.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"You know, Kamala Harris wants to open.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"You know, there's a big lie at the heart of the Kamala Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
But now she's come up with this lie because she's trying to scare our senior citizens.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"So to every person who has come into the country illegally under Kamala Harris's leadership, Kamala Harris wants to roll out the red carpet, give free health care and housing benefits.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Our message to Kamala Harris is yes, we are compassionate people, which is why we want to secure the damn border.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"We wake up on November the 6th, and Kamala Harris has barely elected president of the United States by a 700 vote margin in the state of Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,1
"That if there's a, Kamala Harris put that sign up, ladies and gentlemen.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,0
"Think about it, if the truck driver who's delivering the groceries to the grocery store is paying 45% more for diesel, and he is under Kamala Harris's leadership, then we're all paying more for groceries.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1
"But this particular issue, I think that what Kamala Harris has done is she has used programs that are meant to help people who are escaping tyranny. And that has to stop, because here's what happens, here's what happens when Kamala Harris grants millions upon millions of people legal status.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
Kamala Harris is obsessed with silencing her fellow citizens.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
What you've seen under Secretary Raimondo and Kamala Harris is them trying to say that you're only going to get money to manufacture chips if you do what we want you to do politically.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
But this thing you see with Kamala Harris where she says we're going to hold your government funding hostage unless you agree with our politics.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
And it's going to be very fun to beat Kamala Harris on November the 5th.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1
I think she keeps on making bad decisions for the American people.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
And we want to take away her ability to do that.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
We want to get to a point where Kamala Harris's bad decisions is something she can deal with.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
Because Kamala Harris has gone to war on the American energy sector.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"She's at Douglas, on the over town, holding up a little rally.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"And at this point, like, we thought that Kamala Harris was going to go somewhere in the Phoenix area, because that's where over half the population of Arizona lives at.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
I think it's safe to say that Arizona isn't necessarily in the picture for Kamala Harris right now.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"It's her big, it's gonna be her biggest battle.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"It's gonna be the hardest for her to obtain, and if she really cared about Arizona, she wouldn't be campaigning in Douglas, which is a town, again, of 15,000.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"It's not necessarily to help her polling and her numbers in Arizona, because obviously, if she did that, she wouldn't be in Douglas right now.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"She's just trying to make it appear that she cares about the border, which she really doesn't.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"And honestly, I think, in my personal opinion, I think it's safe to say that Kamala Harris has just given up on Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"If she gets that blue wall, I personally think that's the easiest way to victory.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"And what I see when it just comes down to voter enthusiasm, I don't see people just lining up to vote for Harris.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"I think maybe on some of these polls, people will say they lean towards Harris, but I don't think that's gonna convert to actually coming out to vote during the election.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
But we see that Kamala's desperate for a second debate because she's really not doing too well.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Like every single day that Kamala's, her polling numbers are just slipping away.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
I think all the Harris people just aren't gonna come out on election day.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"And if you look at just Harris's campaign strategy right now, she's trying to run towards the right on those issues.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,1
She's trying to campaign as the border hawk.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0

She also did encourage her supporters today to get out and vote.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1

"Right, she says not for lower income people.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
"I think the Harris administration would be more likely to let the Federal Reserve continue their fight against inflation, which they appear to be winning.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
And this plays into her campaign message that we've been seeing across the trail that she promises and pledges to be a president for all.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
They've seen a translation into the support that we were initially seeing across social media.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1

This is Kamala Harris is doing.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,0,0
So I want you all to watch and listen as they explain to you all the type of people that are coming across our southern border that Kamala Harris has allowed into our country.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
I was seeing a lot of the things that she was saying.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1

"So why she wasn't there, there were some awesome folks who were there to really, you know, stand up and say, look, we're supporting the Kamala Harris wall ticket.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,1
Kamala Harris is proving to be a far more competent and stronger candidate than many thought.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
And it's like Kamala Harris's entire record just doesn't doesn't matter.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"And from that point, when Kamala Harris was attorney general, she went after drug smugglers, human traffickers.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1

She will protect abortion access. She will defend our freedom.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
Kamala Harris is not going to be able to accomplish such.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
She's most likely going to win by about 10 points at most.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
Kamala Harris will triumph by rather less than 15.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Obama, Clinton, and Biden, the last three Democratic nominees, each get about 17 points, harris simply isn't performing as well as the prior three nominees, though.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1

"Furthermore, if you additionally review the polling here, two recent left leaning polls released explain why she is up by such a great margin.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
"Furthermore, merely using common sense here, Kamala Harris cannot truly win a state Biden won by such a narrow margin.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"Apart from a very brief moment at the Democratic Convention when she peaked, Kamala Harris never led in Arizona.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,-1,-1
"The point is, I was just picturing it, the point is if you elect Kamala and Tim, they will not be focused on their problems, they will be focused on yours.",Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
Why should it work for the President of the United States: but the good news is that Kamala Harris does not have concepts of a plan.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1
She has an actual plan to make your life better.,Kamala Harris,Arizona,1,1

People running for local offices like council or mayor have never gotten my support because I donÕt just support candidatesÑmy vote and voice mean something.

But they don't want to come out because they're afraid of being attacked and that's what the situation so I don't believe hopes I can tell you right now.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
So how does that make any sense? So that's why there's gonna be a tremendous amount of support?

"You never know, Trump could have a landslide victory if everything gets put into place.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
I believe he also gets close to winning the popular vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1

"Now I say all this to again, warn Republican voters and Trump voters, uh, not to be complacent and not to think that this election, uh, is one before even a single vote is cast because we need to act like that this race is tightening.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,-1
"Uh, but again, this, this is horrible right here and to happen in Michigan of all places, this is good for Trump and it's good for, uh, undecided voters who maybe are leaning more towards Trump when they see stuff like this, but Democrats continue to shoot themselves in the foot.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"And obviously, I really don't think that Trump is going to protect people who are part of the LGBT community, especially those who are trans.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1

"He ran on a lot of resentment, like you said, false information.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"He's bad because a lot of people, right: a lot of people are like, I just don't like him.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1

"And to see what they're still going through after the hurricanes and to know under Trump's presidency, he was trying to deny them any help because he said that they weren't our problem.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1

"So I don't know that that's necessarily accurate, in Michigan, we have two polls post Biden dropping out and it's an average of Trump plus one and then Minnesota, no matter how many times Trump wants to tell us, oh, this is this is close.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"So what effect has former President Trump's false claims of election fraud had on you personally and your ability to recruit election workers for this and future elections: there's kind of a good side and a bad side to the impact of having a former president spread lies about not just our election administration and procedures, but those who administer them like myself.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"This country's full of support, they hate to say, if Trump were to be reelected, I'm honestly afraid for our country.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"Just go vote Democrat, and then I think 2016, that debate between Hillary and Trump, when she asked about his taxes, and he told us, like, yeah, I'm cheating.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"Trump, he raising taxes.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,0
"That ain't right, Trump ain't shit, he sure ain't.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
We are with President Trump to make America great again through peace and justice for all.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1

42 percent said it's Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0

"When I drive around, I see an awful lot of Trump signs, but I'm encouraged by what I see here today.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
I guess I would say my top issue overall is just getting Donald Trump out.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
I think his rhetoric and the way he's divided people over the past several years has been the most harmful thing for our country.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"What do the numbers actually say: well, I mean, during the Trump administration, there was, you know, from the beginning of Trump's first, you know, when he was inaugurated in 2017 to his the peak of his employment in Michigan, we're not my Michigan alone.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
But a lot of those gains were also seen during the Trump administration.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
They know what will happen to this country if he's president again.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"You took Beaver County, which is Trump country.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Who did the Democrats lose over these years: i think if you even go back eight years, all three of our states went for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
We understand that there are Republicans out there who are lamenting that Donald Trump is their nominee.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,-1
And some of the averages they see Trump actually making a gate.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
They know who Donald Trump is.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
They know what he has done.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"What are they waiting to hear: i mean, they have watched Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
Donald Trump talks a good game about that.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Now, he has a history of failing to deliver over and over and over again.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"And I think part of our responsibility here is to make sure we're letting folks know that despite the noise, despite the bluster, despite the words that come out of his mouth, they're not only empty promises now.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"As Gretchen says, we got the receipts to prove that when he had the keys to the White House before, he failed the American people time and time again.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"But to that point, again, back to those polls, the economy, immigration, by far those people who are polled trust Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"So what you're saying about, look, he didn't do the job back then, they don't think that.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Again, people are still supporting Donald Trump despite what you're saying.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
So Donald Trump's message is getting through.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Donald Trump all hate, that issue, that is a very, very big issue.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"I do not have confidence that Donald Trump won't whine about it, won't put out dangerous rhetoric and mis- and disinformation.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"That's the threat, and I will tell the good people of this Commonwealth and this country, we're prepared for anything Donald Trump throws at us.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"Donald Trump has been reaching out to young male voters, shirking traditional media interviews for conversations with podcasters, influencers and gamers, all popular with the so-called bro vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
He's been doing loads of different podcasts and stuff.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"He's smart, good marketing.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"It's more personable, too, you get to see what he's really like, you know: honestly, it just feels like he's being honest.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"That's a tough one to answer, i think he's more dominant, he's more, uh... Go away!",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,-1
"Other leaders fear him, you know: he gets the word across.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Trump is trying to breach that divide, reaching out to black men, traditional Democrats that poll suggest could switch over to his side.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Tell us about that because he won, but there was some controversy surrounding his victory and Donald Trump, as expected, won in Michigan as well.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Trump, for his part, still managed to underperform what we would expect for a major party leading candidate.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
I don't think there's any real serious concern that they would vote for President Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Yeah, well, the court appearance has certainly helped him with his political base, which has helped him to secure a renomination with the Republican Party.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"So that has redounded to its advantage, the problem is that these court appearances don't sit nearly as well with independent and moderate voters who he's going to need to win the general election.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"So while it has been beneficial to him thus far, once he's locked up the nomination, these repeated court cases are going to prove to be a little bit more of a drag.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
Trump is right on the line there at 50-47.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
He's passionate.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1

"Like I'm all around, i don't have to go there a lot, but when I drive through Michigan, Grand Rapids area, Detroit, Metro Detroit, when I drive through these cities, there are a lot, Oakland County, which is Metro, there are a lot of Trump signs.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
I will see Trump signs back to back to back to back.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"And from when I got into the subdivision, to when I left, which took me about two and a half minutes, I seen 10 Trump signs in Metro Detroit.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1

"I understand everybody doesn't have to put up their political signs, but I've seen more Harris and Walz signs within the last month and a half, but there are overwhelmingly more Trump signs in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
We weren't with Trump. And we were broke with Biden and we weren't with Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,-1
Odds are you know quite a bit about January 6th and the litany of criminal and civil cases brought against Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"You know, it has broken through that life sucks under this regime and that Donald Trump is being persecuted by lawfare.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"This is an amazing clip, has all of the felonies and indictments against Trump has, has that worked to persuade voters actually has made him more popular.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Yeah, nobody should be able to dictate that at all, and what do you think of Trump's position on abortion, i think he's anti, isn't he: yeah.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"He wants to control that, yeah, well, I don't think he has any business even talking about it.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"So I'd like that to change, do you feel like Donald Trump's going to be better on that issue: based on what we've seen on his first four years, I do believe that he will be better on that.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"It is exactly these answers, which is why Donald Trump is now winning effectively on all of the swing states.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Could Donald Trump win the popular vote: well, he is a populist candidate and populism is popular.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"No surprises whatsoever here, at the current polling averages for the state of Michigan, real-clear politics currently has Trump leading by 1.2 percent of the vote in its RCP average.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
270 to win has Donald Trump leading 0.4 percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Decisintesk HQ, The Hill has Trump leading 0.6 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Very very close, looking at the political market forecasting odds, Polymarket has Trump at 59 percent in the state of Michigan to win it.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"As for national, Trump currently has 64.3 percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Trump got over 264,000 votes from Wayne County.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"Donald Trump got 325,000 votes.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"If she's under-performing Biden, then it depends by how much, because that may be enough ground for Trump to make up and win the state.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"And Trump needs to likely get back to the 2016 numbers of around 11 and a half, 12 percent range in the margin of victory in this county to be able to win Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
Trump won it by 3.1.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"34.3 for Romney, 30.5 for Trump in 2016, and then 21.5 for Trump in 2020, trump needs to get these numbers back up to the 2016 30.5 percent chance, or 20, 30.5 percent to have a chance at winning Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
And Donald Trump got 47.8 percent of the statewide vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"Looking at the 2016 map where Donald Trump won the state, he had 47.5% of the statewide vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Ottawa County 62 to 31.5 win for Trump, kent County 48.1 to 45% a win for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
In 2020 Donald Trump got 47.8% of the statewide vote in Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"So even though he lost the state, he did perform better in Michigan than he did in 2016.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
So I am very confident barring a massive polling list that Donald Trump will get somewhere between 41.6 and 50.9% in the state of Michigan on election night 2024.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"However, we're not used to seeing in Michigan Trump being up 1.2% in the state compared to the polling in 2016 and 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"We never saw that, so we're kind of an uncharted territory and seeing Trump leading in the state of Michigan in the polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"And looking at the factors now for the state of Michigan, the state polling data, as I mentioned, Trump is up 1.2% right now.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
That factor goes for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
So that certainly benefits Donald Trump and would lead to a likely electoral college win for Trump and a popular vote defeat.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,-1
Now Trump is leading here by 1.2%.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"And Michigan has been one of the ones where he's been gaining a lot more than some of the other ones, so that does benefit Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
Trump would still be favored based on all the factors to win the state of Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"For my prediction for the state of Michigan in its 15 electoral votes, I'm predicting that Donald Trump will win the state of Michigan with 49.4% of the vote.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"And I just think Trump is first of all going to likely overperform what he got in 2016 and 2020 in the state of Michigan, 47.8.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"He's almost certainly going to outperform that, the question is, how much does he outperform it by and what does it end up being? So the Republican and the Democratic numbers are kind of hard to guess in Michigan, seeing as there's really not a track record for a Republican getting over 50% of the vote in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"That has not happened yet, if Trump doesn't on election night, he'll be the first Republican in Michigan to do that, I think since the 1980s.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
What is it about Trump that just says no: he's an idiot.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"Meanwhile, more voters think Trump is more likely to say that things are not true.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"You know, Donald Trump can win.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"So the bubble inside Trump world is overwhelming, saying that Donald Trump is going to win this race.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"And I'm surprised myself by still being surprised by how negative, how exclusionary, how racist the attacks against Puerto Rico, the attacks again against Hispanic, against Hispanic, exactly what Donald Trump said years ago, that Hispanics were breeders.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"I think the number I keep going back to and it's a number that I have been looking at for three years now, if Donald Trump is going to run.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
Donald Trump is at forty eight percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
There was he was never going to get over forty seven percent.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,0
"Maybe we'll be saying that, but I still think that's the question for Donald Trump to win.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"But still, that's where I'm still suck, he's got a hard ceiling.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
How are they feeling about the campaign: we are pumped up and excited.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"You know, labor supports those that support us, and we are pumped up and excited.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Energetic, we got the momentum.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
That's a place Donald Trump will never be.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
Vance and Trump like to portray themselves as the party of the working class actually now.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
Do they seem authentic to you: i don't think I can say on camera what I feel about that.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"You know, one of the things that I keep on talking about is when Donald Trump was in Michigan and he was in a non-union shop, he pretended it was like a union shop.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"He gave non-union workers signs that said union workers for Trump, then he told them that they're picketing for the wrong reasons.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"This clip just continues to stand out in my mind, but also Donald Trump continued to make representations about the auto industry in Michigan that just don't seem to match reality.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"Chad is the politics editor at the Detroit News and obviously writes a lot of pieces about the auto industry in Michigan, but one stood out to me recently where you talked about how Donald Trump keeps lamenting the big auto plants are being constructed in Mexico.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"And at the same time, Trump was saying that in Michigan, six miles from where he was standing, there was a gigantic auto plant being built at that exact moment.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
Does Donald Trump's rhetoric on the auto industry meet the reality: it does not.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
He is kind of actively out trashing the transition to electric vehicles and then turns around and praises Tesla and calls those EVs beautiful.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"And so this was a really interesting moment where he's in essentially a bedroom community of Lansing, Michigan that has two major general motors plants.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1
"And so here you had Trump, he was trashing the Infra- the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, but that IRA, that law is providing a $500 million grant to General Motors to convert that Lansing Grand River plant to an EV plant in the future.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"Now there's also the issue of Donald Trump attacking foreign auto suppliers in Michigan, but then encouraging when it suits him, foreign auto manufacturers in Michigan, and it's entirely inconsistent as well to say, you're gonna ban a supplier, but then potentially welcome a manufacturer.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"When Donald Trump goes into Michigan, goes to a non-union plant, pretends it's a union plant, like literally creates a scene like out of the apprentice with people holding signs, to me, and when I hear what President Sean Fain says, that's highly offensive to make a mockery of workers and their livelihood.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"Donald Trump paints this doom and gloom scenario that you would think it was Governor Walz that we were living in Mad Max, like that there was an apocalypse taking place in Michigan, and that's not what's happening.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
He's the self-proclaimed king of debt.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"I mean, literally Donald Trump could not have come to a more important corridor right now in Michigan than the I-69 corridor where he was standing at this auto, or it's a metal supply plant.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"Chad, finally, when I was watching Donald Trump speak at that factory, I couldn't help but notice the people who were behind him, who were from time to time, they looked a little confused by some of the things.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"And we saw this in our polling this week, which our Detroit News, WDIV poll shows Trump with just a narrow one point lead, well within the margin of error.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"I'm still undecided, do you like Donald Trump: yeah.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"He's like fighter, fighter man.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
What's Donald Trump's answer to the Gaza war: he is a convenient line for both sides.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"And he loves telling Michigan's voters all about his daughter Tiffany's new Arab husband, Michael Bulos, the son of a Lebanese billionaire.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
We like him.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"The last time he was president, he banned Muslims from coming into the US from six different Muslim countries.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
So he said a lot and done less.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"Again, he's coming from a business perspective.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"I wouldn't really believe he would do that as much like, you know, he's just saying it to back outskipping.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"And this is not really one of his goals, so to summarise, you're going to vote for Trump because he's not going to do precisely what he says he's going to do.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
And now the Trump campaign is practically making Michigan its second home.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Hillary Clinton was ahead in the polls in 2016 until she wasn't, until President Trump recognized how important Michigan was and camped out in Michigan in the final days.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
President Trump understands how important Michigan is.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
And he's focused on fixing America starting right here in the center of the electoral universe right here in Michigan.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"He's starting in Macomb County, spreading through Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"They thought there was a chance and they're not going to spend two billion dollars on building a plant and then have, you know, Trump get elected and put two hundred percent.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
Trump is sitting plus eight when you combine all the battleground states and all their polling.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
We like that Trump is up eight when you combine the battlegrounds.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
Trump is the ultimate closer.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
Now Trump's down to plus point six and you've got liberals left and right.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"They also, yeah, they got it tied.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"Now Trump's plus point one, he's obviously pulling a lot better.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Holy crap, trump went up from 60 was 66 down to 61 back up to 63.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"It's Trump's leading all these swing states if Trump's up eight, but they combine them, it's like, why see, why are we combining these: this doesn't make any sense.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
We've got Nate Silver now finally admitting that Trump's going to win.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"It was inevitable, he said, quote, My gut says Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
So he's saying that Trump's barely going to win.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"More likely than not, all the top experts have come together and said Trump probably two and a half point victory in Michigan, probably about a two point victory in Wisconsin and like a three point two victory in Pennsylvania with the Elon Musk factor and everything and all the free speech and all the threats and all the assault against Trump and the assassination attempt and all it all comes together in Pennsylvania.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
And Trump probably wins by around three point two.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"How big of a lead does he have: well, it's a tiny lead right now.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Trump won with 47.8, so Michigan is always tight.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"And right now, with 11 months to go, Trump is ahead in Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"And I mean, it's hard to know for sure, but directionally, it does look like Trump is starting to get more sort of oomph with the auto workers.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"And that's what they're going to vote on, Donald Trump's policies.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
And Trump does really well with sort of his populist message.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
And they are thinking about a pre-COVID world when Donald Trump was running the country.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
Then you have the rural areas where Trump has a tremendous amount of support.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
Trump won the election.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
But it's why we don't need the Trump strategy of tax cuts for the rich and import taxes for the rest of us.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"So we're seeing an independent split here among these independent voters, Trump slightly winning these voters 47 to 45.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
And it might be better to phrase that as Rogers is really underperforming Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"So you can kind of see how some of these independent voters may prefer a Trump approach to some of these issues, the economy and immigration, those being winning issues for Donald Trump across the swing states.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"I'm excited and proud to be from this community, and we're excited to have President Trump here today.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"But I think the enthusiasm and the interest in people coming here to see President Trump shows the capture that he has with people, especially in small towns throughout our country, but really here in Michigan, which ranks as certainly probably the top or top one or two most competitive swing state in the country.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
He's willing to go out and engage with members of the media.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
He's willing to engage with members of the public.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"The same really isn't true, i mean, you've got all these people who used to work for Trump when he was president, coming out against him.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"These are the 2016 margins of victory, the key states, and how many votes Jill Stein got back then when Donald Trump won 50,000, 30,000, almost 50,000 with Michigan being the top at 51-4.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,1
"Absolutely, Connell, a vote for Jill Stein is a vote for Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
Staying home is a vote for Donald Trump.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"Of course, the election is on November 5, and it appears that Donald Trump has turned the dial his way just weeks out from the US election.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Steph, is that the way that you're reading it at the moment, that the dial has turned slightly to Donald Trump: he has certainly made some ground in some of the key battleground states that he would have to win in November to win the electoral college, specifically in Michigan and Wisconsin.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
A continual problem for Donald Trump has been his inability to attack properly the vice president. He still doesn't seem to have got that right at this point.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
We'll see whether he ends up caving and deciding he wants to kind of go at it again and maybe reclaim some of his debating skills there and try again and convince American people that he's the person they should be voting for.,Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
Trump might only lose the popular vote by around one.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"Now you're down by 1.8, if the election finished and there was zero error on the popular vote to where Trump lost it by 1.8, that would very likely be an electoral college victory for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"He might only lose it this cycle by 21, 22.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"The polls are getting very, very close, but the betting is what Trump is, is doing really well.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
I do like where Trump is at this point.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
He was up around two points.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
This is another state where Trump getting that wall street journal poll really helps him out.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
But I do think Trump is probably going to win the state by around point four to point five.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Even if Trump loses it, you're talking about 306 electoral votes versus 312.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"If he's able to sweep all the other swing states, it's not that big of a deal.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"But you get that Trump plus six liberals could say, well, that's an outlier.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"Certainly by a bigger margin than Michigan, we did get a Quinnipiac poll that had Trump plus two in 2020.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
He ended up only winning by point three.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,-1
"When you look at the data, you move on to Michigan, Trump sitting plus point nine.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
You're getting Jill Stein possibly helping Trump out Jill Stein winning the Muslim vote.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
They've got Trump plus two.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
Quinnipiac has Trump plus four.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
Trump won Michigan in 2016.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Pretty crazy there, again, another state where it seems like the data would check out based off of the previous Trump elections to where Trump is sitting in a very, very good spot in Michigan because you could say he's up by a point.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"But Trump sitting plus point one, basically 50 50.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0
"I mean, you do have Trump leading three out of the last four polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
You do have Trump sitting plus point five.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0
"Trump plus one plus one plus two plus one plus one plus two, so he's leading all these polls.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
So now Trump's sitting plus point five.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0
I do think Trump is probably you can see Trump was up one point five there.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Yeah, some of these polls that had Trump up by four and three got taken out, I guess.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,0
I know Trump recently went ahead.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"It's basically 50 50, but Trump may be 51.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"The polling is checking out, if we went into election night like this, we're looking amazing for our Trump victory.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Amazing, so listen, if they stay relatively the same bunched up like this, it's going to be very, very good for Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"A lot of, you know, Trump's victory actually inspired a lot of women to run.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"And he is, I believe, an existential threat to America's labor movement.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"They don't want to vote for either, and the other is this group from Yemen who is saying we want to support Donald Trump.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"If we have the Arab American community come out and support Donald Trump in that way, that is a huge change for the state of Michigan.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"Yeah, it's true, but Trump's got great joy on the job.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
Trump looks like a winner.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
He looks like a winner.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
He's a metaphor for America.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
I don't know if he's a winner.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"And here's what works, it gives people a reason and some grace who aren't supposed to be Trump voters to be Trump voters.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1

"And right now we haven't gotten any specific policies, but he has stated that he wanted to stop the war.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"And what I can say is that with 100% certainty, had this had been occurring under the Trump's presidency, we would have seen Democrats stand up and find their moral compass as they did when he moved the embassy.",Donald Trump,Michigan,0,0

What about Donald Trump: Donald Trump has a solid safe seats of 188 electoral college votes.,Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
"In 2016, when Trump won, and this was the shock because a Republican had not won those states until 20 years prior to that, when he won Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, these are the so-called blue wall states.",Donald Trump,Michigan,1,1
I think we have to each do our part to prevent a Donald Trump presidency.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
Donald Trump called me that woman from Michigan as an insult.,Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"Around 80% of the African Americans here in Michigan vote for the Democratic Party, and many of them fear that if Donald Trump wins this election, the racism and discrimination they face will get worse.",Donald Trump,Michigan,-1,-1
"No, I'm not so sure, retiree John Brady is backing Vice President Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1

Sloan Davis is part of the Harris coalition but half-heartedly.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1
"Kamala Harris leads in key battleground states Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, according to New Washington Post polls.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Harris holds narrow leads in four critical battleground states Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Despite not having overwhelmingly positive favorability ratings, her stance on these key issues is helping her win over voters who may have reservations about her candidacy, but are still aligning with her on policy grounds.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"In Michigan and Pennsylvania, Harris has a two-point edge in each, both of which are critical to either candidate's path to victory.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
One of the key factors driving Harris's performance is her overwhelming support among young women.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Additionally, Harris is performing well on issues like health care and abortion.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Harris holds a slim but consistent lead in the Rust Belt states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which were crucial to Joe Biden's 2020 victory. If she can maintain these leads, they could form a key part of her electoral firewall.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Harris had maintained a lead here throughout much of the campaign, but the latest data shows that the state has tightened.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"You can see on the basis of this result, Kamala Harris narrowly wins, but literally she's on the nose.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
And today we are gonna be talking about the battleground state of Michigan getting a whole new set of new polls out of the state showing Kamala Harris expanding from where she was before of a minor lead across the state.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
Now to the most recent poll from Michigan State University showing Kamala Harris with roughly a 4.6% 4.7% lead across the battleground state.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
That showed Michigan in a position where Kamala Harris held a two point lead against the former president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"And like I said, Emerson College, not Emerson College, Bloomberg and Morning Consult, the Michigan State University poll, some other data points too that we've been seeing, Quinnipiac University just released a data point just a few days ago, showing Kamala Harris with a 3-point lead in the state of Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"That Kamala Harris holds a narrow advantage in the state of Michigan, enough that I actually might translate her to winning in that battleground state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"And granted, the numbers in Michigan don't always translate to amazing numbers for Kamala Harris in states like Wisconsin.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"241 to 219 means that Kamala Harris also has additional pathways to the presidency because Michigan has given her 15 electoral votes that boosts her forward, right: boost her to 241.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"She's no longer at that number, 226, which is where she was before, 241 from 226. That's good for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
It gives her options as to how she reaches the magic number of 270 electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"And so you can see Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and Michigan would be enough to put Kamala Harris over 270, which means even if she loses Florida, Texas, Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania would really be a shocker here.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"I think Kamala Harris should be happy to see some data points like this that show Kamala Harris leading in Michigan, and in a way in the majority in some of these polls.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"When you take a look at what's expected of her in 538, even though she has a 55% chance of winning the electoral votes in Michigan, she's only barely at that majority mark, 50.3 to 49.7.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"Maybe some of the internal, show Kamala Harris, in a pretty okay position in the state of Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"But I think that also speaks to the range at which we could see Harris win by one, two, three points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Michigan, same thing, Kamala Harris is in a good position in Michigan, there's no denying that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Doesn't mean she would be guaranteed to win it, the answer is absolutely not.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1
"And I mean, all these different things, Quinnipiac, Michigan State University, TLDR, the numbers are getting better for Kamala Harris in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Should Kamala Harris win Michigan, I'd honestly bet that she's winning Pennsylvania and potentially with it, the presidency as she goes across the electoral map and wins individual swing states that get her closer and closer to 270 until she absolutely crosses it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"No guarantee that she wins Michigan at this point. It's obviously more likely than not, but I will say this, Michigan has been a tricky one for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1
"But as of right now, the numbers are telling us that Kamala Harris is doing a lot better in Michigan than she was before.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
And some very reputable sources as they enter into the final stages of polling and understanding the race are saying Kamala Harris is starting to win back support.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"If there was ever a time for Kamala Harris to turn around a race, turn around some of these battlegrounds, that time would be now.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"It's because even though she's losing big lead, she's losing big lead among groups that make up a small portion of the electorate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"And she's making it up among groups that make up a big portion of the electorate, even if the movements are small.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"When it's all about turnout, what's key is enthusiasm, right, you know, whose voters are more excited about going out to vote: and Harris has like a 10 point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
She also has about a 10 point advantage on women voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
So I see a lot of signs that polling is not picking up their advantages for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
And I think that she's going to win.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
So this conventional wisdom that on college campuses is all women and they're all voting for Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
Again I take your point that you think Harris is on track to win here.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"The ticket has now changed, how do you view this new ticket, would you meet with the Harris-Walz ticket today: as I've expressed since President Biden has stepped aside and Vice President Harris has become the nominee for the Democratic Party, we believe the door has cracked open that there's now opportunity to have dialogue for us to understand how Vice President Harris will differentiate herself from President Biden on the path for Gaza.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
We have seen thus far that she has demonstrated being tough on rhetoric as it pertains to the remarks she made following her private meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"But more than just being tough on rhetoric, we're hoping that she pairs that rhetoric with tough policy.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1
We believe that this should be the shield for Vice President Harris and Governor Walz on this issue. And that's probably going to help Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"And if you look at 538, their polling average, Harris has a slight advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"She'll have 276, so that's something else that we're looking at.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"There's a wave, a Democratic wave going across the country as she's going around with all these events here.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Is it possible to keep this momentum going, what does she need to do to keep the momentum between now and November: i think that she keeps doing what she's doing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
I think that she's got a ton of momentum.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"People are excited, her message of hope and positiveness and what's right about the country is connecting with people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"And again, no matter your politics, it's hard to have watched that and not to clear Harris the winner, at least poll after poll continues to show.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"And on the behalf of 245 active in retirees in Michigan, our members want to make sure that we don't lose Michigan and Walz and Harris are the ticket that we're gonna bring home in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"It's the same old rhetoric and we're not going back to Tim Walz and Kamala Harris, give us a vision for all people, working class people, not just teamsters, not just unions, even though all the unions at Michigan support the Harris-Walz campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
And she made sure that they could retire with dignity and respect.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have the same vision as we do here in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"But the overall majority of Michigan teamsters at all the labor unions in Michigan understand that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz give us the best opportunity to move forward from hatred, visceral comments, they're desecrating our veterans.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"I've come a third generation veteran family and they should be honored and cherished, not disgraced. And Kamala Harris and Tim Walz who wore a uniform for 24 years, surely gets that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
And Kamala Harris will never stop fighting for middle-class Americans. She understands the struggles.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"But the truth is, I can have those conversations with Kamala Harris when we disagree.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0
"When Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Kamala Harris became the nominee, Adam was initially hopeful.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"You know, we hear a lot of talks about a ceasefire, but Kamala Harris and everybody, they say, you know, we want a ceasefire, but, and then what we want to see is a permanent ceasefire.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"You know, I know right now in the polls, Kamala Harris is up. But guess what? Hillary Clinton, a week before elections, was up 10% in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1
"Now, a recent national poll puts Kamala Harris' support with the Muslim community at 30%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
So we also need to talk about Kamala Harris being a threat to our democracy and the Democratic Party being a threat to our democracy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"The campaign, VP Harris, the administration, they have repeatedly said to us that they actually don't want us to mobilize their people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"If Harris does not move as it relates to policy, I cannot come out and endorse Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"But as more and more Arab and Muslim voters stop being loyal to the Democratic Party, it could make Kamala Harris's path to the White House extremely difficult.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"The race in Michigan is extremely close, with Harris holding a slight but consistent lead in most polls.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"A fourth TIP Insights poll from the same period, with 741 different likely voters, shows Harris leading 47% to 45%.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"However, Harris began closing the gap, and by mid-August she had taken the lead, peaking around August 12th with a 3.4 percentage point advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Since then, her margin has slightly decreased, but she continues to hold the upper hand.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"This shift suggests that Harris's campaign efforts, particularly in urban centers like Detroit and Ann Arbor, have effectively rallied her base.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
Harris's ability to sustain her momentum and possibly widen her lead will be critical in securing Michigan's electoral votes.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
So how big of a problem does Harris have with young men: she has one.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
Another demographic that Harris seems to have some issues with is Arab American voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
She is doing better amongst women.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"I mean, look, relatively speaking, she is a newer candidate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
She's not talking about the economy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
She's not talking about the border.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"January 6th stuff, that's where she pulls better.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0
So she's at least going to close on the two issues that voters trust her and think she's best able to handle.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"What is she gonna do: look, the polling is all trending away from her.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"Right now in the Rust Belt, right: the three most important swing states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, right now, she's behind in all, he may sweep all three of them.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"And in Michigan, which is probably the solid, most solid blue of those three, in the last 10 polls, she's only up by one.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"But we'll, by specific Harris, signal to Democratic voters, 101,000 in Michigan, that she will end the killing and occupation of Palestinians.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"So yes, I think that she is at risk for losing peace between swing states, especially in states like Michigan, where we have the largest concentration of Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, people who know firsthand the effects and the impact of American-funded bombing.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"If Kamala wants my vote, I want her to take a hard stance against these forever wars.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"I want her to take a hard stance against giving Israel any more money, especially for military purposes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1
"She can come out tomorrow and be like, hey, ceasefire, we're going to stop funding this war and we're going to move on.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"But I got to see, I don't know, Vice President Harris, I don't know her that well.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"For Kamala Harris, these states represent both a formidable challenge and a significant opportunity to connect with voters.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"To secure the presidency, she'll need to win back voters who felt left behind by the Democratic Party's previous strategies and policies.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"But beyond that, she'll also need to energize a base that is still reeling from the shock of 2016, reigniting their passion and commitment.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
She must unite a fractured Democratic Party while also appealing to independents and disaffected Republicans.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
The outcome in Michigan and Wisconsin could very well hinge on her ability to do just that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
Kamala Harris faces an uphill battle in Michigan and Wisconsin.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
She needs to convince voters that she understands their concerns and has a plan to address them.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
She needs to articulate a clear vision for the future that resonates with their hopes and aspirations.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1
One of her biggest challenges is overcoming the perception that she is a creature of the coastal elite.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1

And I'm also really excited to be out here supporting Kamala Harris for president.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
I think that's definitely one of the top things that she should do when she gets elected.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
What do you think Kamala should do first if she gets elected: she'll know what to do.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1

She's she's been making a pretty direct appeals to that subset of voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"And one of the main leaders of this is US Rep Rashida to leave who prominent Democrat from Detroit has not said who she's voting for president which is something that I think looms over, over the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
Organizing and brushing up on their talking points are how these Chicago volunteers for Kamala Harris are spending their day.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
Harris and Walz were here on Wednesday as well so it's quite obvious that they see Michigan as a primary state that they need to woo and they recognize that it is blue now from the governor on down and they are probably going to schedule a lot more visits to Michigan between now and November.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"And right now Kamala Harris shows a lead in Michigan according to the RealClearPolitics average, it shows her with a two and a half point lead although I think it's tighter than that because there's just one throwaway poll in there that shows her with an 11 point lead I don't think anybody believes that, you don't, I don't.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1
"I believe from what I'm hearing is people want to hear them talk about the issues, the issues that are impacting their lives, how much they're paying for groceries, how much they're paying for gas, for small business owners here in Michigan, how difficult it is to start and continue a small business especially now with these minimum wage and tip mandates coming down in February and Michigan and so I think that so-called honeymoon period with Harris will wear off, people are going to want to hear how their lives are going to be better over the next four years with either of these candidates.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"Look, if you look at, look, too much of this conversation, by the way, is asymmetrical, right: it's all about Harris and what she's got to do.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0

She's really not gaining votes because we're actually going to be diving in to the polling in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"Yeah, this is not a good sign for her votes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
And the reason why a Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney is endorsing Kamala Harris is because they want the wars.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1

She is in third place with Muslims in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1
"This is not good, this is definitely not good news for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"And really, guys, it's really because of somebody's polls right here like Maris and Quinnipiac saying that Harris is up plus five.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0
I don't believe she's going to win Michigan with that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
Kamala Harris is not reaching Biden numbers.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"It was 2.8, 2.8, and if you actually look at this, yeah, Michigan not looking very good for Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1

"Voting's already started, i've already debated twice, i won twice, kamala Harris, she knows she's losing. She knows that, forget what the polls say, man.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
We always hear about Harris having to defend her blue wall and of course Michigan is a major part of that.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
She doesn't have the record to run on. I think that's been hurting her.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"And Selena, first and foremost, we saw Harris there as she has on stage today with Liz Cheney lean into this idea and this messaging to disaffected Republican voters to try to bring them into the Democratic fold and try to run up the numbers with that demographic specifically in some of those key swing states like Michigan, where she has been, like Wisconsin, where she's going.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"But today she's saying to those voters that even if they are anti-abortion rights, they should still vote for Vice President Harris because those abortion bans have gone too far.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1

"If anything, and some of the issues, especially regarding the automobile industry, she's further left than where Joe Biden was.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
I think she will be a strong candidate.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
I think she'll be a great president of the United States.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, a close ally of Biden during his race, acknowledged her personal choice is not necessarily set just yet.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"I'm not going anywhere, so what should Harris be looking forward to win Michigan: quite frankly, I want to see someone who cares about the Heartland, who understands the battleground state, who's going to work hard to bring people together, who's going to care about our economy fighting for working men and women.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1
Maybe this isn't all roses and ginger snaps for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1

"And so even if we're the only ones and our people understand that that might be the case, the only movement, the only organization that abandons Harris, we will do it regardless of consequence.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
And obviously there was some overlap between the uncommitted movement and what was initially the abandoned Biden movement that's now the abandoned Harris movement.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"So can you explain to our audience what is the difference between the uncommitted movement and then the idea of abandoned Harris: so the critical difference that I would say between both is that we believe our leverage comes from punishing, ensuring the defeat of those who have violated the civil rights of innocent people.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"People from all backgrounds, African American, Latino, Gen Z, people from all ages, religions, Hindu, Christian, Jewish, Muslim are part of the abandoned Biden and now abandoned Harris movement.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
Harris is going to continue the same exact policies under Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
They all want the Biden-Harris administration to get much tougher with Israel and try harder to stop the civilian deaths.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
Online ads try to emphasize Kamala Harris' understanding of the civilian cost of this conflict. But Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan want her to lay out a Middle East strategy that differs from Joe Biden's.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
Backing his call for cease fires in Gaza and Lebanon is not enough for her to win back some crucial Michigan voters.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"Which gives you the most optimism for the next four years for your business: i really support Kamala Harris and the $50,000 that she's proposing to give to startups.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1

What they're finding here is that Kamala Harris is up by four.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0
"In Michigan, they're finding that Kamala Harris leads by roughly two points.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Because I do think what we have found between Georgia and Michigan is that should Michigan start to revert away from Kamala Harris, like we've been seeing over the past week and Georgia starts to inch closer to her, it's a possibility that, especially maybe not this cycle, but in future cycles, because Michigan is becoming a state that has a higher concentration of non-college-educated white voters that tend to be the strongest base for the Republican Party in comparison to states like Georgia, where you're starting to see an increase of white college-educated voters and voters of color across the state.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1
"As of right now, Kamala Harris holds a narrow advantage, but ultimately still a close race.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1
"Beyond that, though, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, that's enough for Kamala Harris to win the election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"But it's definitely pleasant news for the Kamala Harris campaign where they previously were thinking, no data points between now and the election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"And Kamala Harris, unsurprisingly, is maintaining that average in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"In so far as it's not usually close, Harris leads by 51 to 43 and critically in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1

"They're mostly not with Kamala, because of what Biden has been doing and having been supporting that.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
This has been consistent where Vice President Harris has had a lead on values and that's starting to expand a little bit.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
47 percent of the group said they trust Vice President Kamala Harris more and that's not it.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1

SheÕs done a really good job engaging hundreds of our neighbors at State University on Sunday, ahead of TuesdayÕs election, addressing key demographics in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1

"Harris started, quote, like a rocket in Michigan, and now she's slipping.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"When Harris replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee in July, Ms. Paul was hopeful as she saw the vice president go off like a rocket in Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"But with less than a month to go before election day, Harris' honeymoon period in Michigan would be ending, leaving her pathway to victory less certain.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"So, let's talk about that, is Kamala Harris' honeymoon period over: i would say that the signs point to yes, to the extent that she had one.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0
I think that one thing that might have blunted some of her momentum is the JD Vance versus Tim Walz debate.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"At this point, excuse me, there is no obvious solution for Harris to break ahead, said Michigan State University politics professor Matt Grossman.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"Harris's entrance into the race led to more than 100,000 new volunteers in Michigan while she has visited Michigan more than any other state besides Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Well, then yeah Harris still win the state and so I'm not saying they've given up on the issue, but they do not see this as the determinative factor that will lose Michigan over this story. A problem they did a few months ago and the other tell there is Alyssa Slockin who's running for Senate.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,1
Is that a warning to Vice President Harris: It could be. And it's about how President Harris is going to able to overcome this.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1
"Hey Adrian, well Vice President Kamala Harris came out and within the first five minutes of her being on stage she addressed the Arab American community and we have been reporting about the Arab American community here in Michigan and that they feel like they have been forgotten by the Democratic Party because of the Biden-Harris administration support of Israel's war in Gaza.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"Lots of people out and excited to see Harris and most of the people actually raised their hand when Harris asked them if they had already early voted and we know in Michigan so far there have been records broken just yesterday over 147,000 people voted here in this state but Harris talked about a lot of different things during her speech.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
Now we heard her regular talking points that she does at all the other rallies but she also really talked to a Gen Z because that is who she's talking to at this rally.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
She is really trying to court the college student vote.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
She spoke about how she loves Gen Z and how she also wants to work with them on climate change.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
She talked to them about how they're the generation that grew up having active shooter drills and also that they're the group that will have less rights than their mothers and grandmothers before them.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
She actually went to a church service and then she went on to a small local business and then which she actually went to a chicken and waffle restaurant that's owned by a former Detroit Lions player and then she went on to a barbershop in a predominantly black neighborhood because she was really trying to get out the black vote there because we have seen her try to court those voters and we've actually seen her in her support increase over the last few months.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
Since August she's actually jumped up about 18 points when it comes to the support from black voters in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
So in Michigan about 13% of the voting population here is black voters and about 84% of them say they're team Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1

"Unfortunately, President Vice President Harris talks about what she's going to do, what she's going to do.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0
"One for Harris, when Kamala Harris became the nominee for president, we as democrats, his folks with progressive values were able to switch from defense to offense.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
And I think people forgot the fundamentals of this election when Kamala Harris took over the nomination.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"They didn't have the cover that they had when the Democrats rather didn't have the cover they had when Joe Biden was the nominee, that he is nominally Catholic, that he goes to Mass on Sundays.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
Kamala Harris is not seemingly practicing anything.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"She's nominally Christian, i'm not sure if she goes to church on a regular basis.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0
I think it is looking pretty clear like her proximity to Biden on that issue hurt her especially badly in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
I'm glad to be working with you and other Michigan Republicans to send Kamala Harris to the White House this November.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Year after year, globalist politicians like Kamala Harris sold you out and let other countries loot and pillage and plunder your wealth.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
But do not give a vote to Kamala Harris and expect to be welcomed by my community.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"They're both the same, she is horrendous on every single policy.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1

"She was asked directly, like, would you support an arms embargo: and she said, no.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,-1
"That's the big uncommitted, the uncommitted haven't decided to move away from the Democratic party, i compare the uncommitted to a battered woman, who is still holding on to the possibility that maybe tomorrow her husband won't beat her, even though he's been beating her for the past four years.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"She needs to be far, far more willing, her campaign needs to be far, far more willing to say the way we've approached the issue does not necessarily seem to be working, because you're saying that you are working around the clock for a ceasefire for months and there's nothing to show for it.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
Kamala Harris has a history of fighting for the American worker.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
Kamala Harris is looking out for us.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1

"One thing we must acknowledge is that if you look at the polls today, it seems as though Kamala Harris's convention bump has peaked.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
And we have seen a reversal where Kamala Harris is polling seems to be coming back down.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"Harris is holding a lead, but it's half a point.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"And right now, the real clear politics map has it as a win for Harris, but barely a win for Harris with only two hundred and seventy three electoral votes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
Kamala Harris has got this.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"So that's where we are right now, plus one point nine may have been the peak for Kamala Harris that we talked about post convention convention.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
She's backed off of that lead by about half a point.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"Putting Michigan in the lean Republican category, on our chart, Harris's path to success is dependent on Michigan, as it is often expected of rust belt neighbors Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"Losing all three would undoubtedly throw Harris's path to 270 electoral votes off track, starting two states to the west.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
Harris's lead has increased from 8 to 9.3 points.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Although all of these polls have a margin of error, the only one that shows Harris ahead is from less reliable pollster Atlas info which examines prior polling failures.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"After controlling for weighted error, Harris' lead increases slightly from 6 over 4% to 6.5%, despite the very tiny polling flaws.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Harris, like Michigan and Pennsylvania, has led since late July.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"They're not angry, and I just am really impressed by the Harris campaign.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"And they believe that Kamala Harris, many of them, most of them that we talk to, is the right choice for Michigan.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Yeah, you know, and I was just wondering when this, you know, this report out that the Harris campaign may be concerned about whether it can win Michigan or not.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"Now, a recent national poll puts Kamala Harris' support with the Muslim community at 30%, and that's tied with the percentage of Muslim Americans who say they're planning on voting for Jill Stein and the Green Party, and that number includes Adam.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,1
"The campaign, VP Harris, the administration, they have repeatedly said to us that they actually don't want us to mobilize their people, that they're willing to put those votes on the table.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"Do you have a theory on why that support isn't stronger given everything that the Biden Harris administration has done for unions: well, I think at a time, Alex, of massive income and wealth inequality, at a time when 60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck, at a time when we have a broken, very expensive health care system, time when we're the only major country not to provide medical and family leave, at a time when we have more income and wealth inequality than we've ever had.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"And it sort of begs the question, is it something else, is it actually independent of Joe Biden's record: i'm going to just take Harris out of the equation here, given Joe Biden was only getting 50% of their support.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
Who is standing up and fighting for them? And I think Kamala has got to be strong.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Look, she's brought forth a number of very good ideas.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Housing crisis, she wants about three million units.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1

I think Harris is going to take it again.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"Her chances are very good, you know why? Because love is on the ballot this year.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
I mean the fact is is that had Biden been nominated which he was going to be and then resigned it would have gone to Harris and it would have been no controversy.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,0,0
"That's why it's not mentioned, this is social engineering. They'll act like it never happened. However, if something is convenient for them, such as January 6th, they'll keep bringing it up. Meanwhile, the economy is struggling, and the border remains a significant issue with people entering the country illegally, often without any verification of who they are. The average middle-class American isn't focused on January 6th; they want to know how to make their dollars stretch further. Kamala Harris's so-called ""opportunity economy"" isn't providing the answers they need.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
She's not gonna get better for you.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1

And that's going to come back to haunt her in the state of Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
These folks are not going to vote for Kamala Harris as she just came out and she said that she wouldn't have done anything different from Biden.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"So the fact that she's basically a Joe Biden 2.0 and you have Arab Americans, Muslim Americans coming out, protesting, this is not good in the state of Michigan with less than four weeks to go.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1

"But speaking of Michigan, since you know that state, I imagine almost as well as you do any other state at this point in the United States, you've been spending a lot of time there this year as part of an attempt to understand how this crucial voting bloc in Michigan, other states as well, but particularly Michigan, which are Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, are thinking about the US support for the role, for the Israeli War in Gaza, for Israel in general, that has been supported basically limitlessly by Joe Biden and now by Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1

"So that when the state of Michigan defeats Kamala Harris and when other swing states swing away from blue and swing toward justice, we can claim credit.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
But Harris isn't fighting for our best interests either.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
It's almost more insulting for Harris to claim she's pro-union while never actually doing anything that uplifts the working class.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
We know that CEOs of most big corporations and the ultra-wealthy are falling all over themselves to support Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
The Biden-Harris administration also cut the expansion to child tax credits.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
But Harris has declared that she will not stop the shipments to Israel.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"A genocide unparalleled, i happen to be one of the two founders of a movement, Abandon Biden, Abandon Harris, and we are asking everyone to vote, not for the despicable candidates who sit atop the two major political parties, but to vote for the courageous, those who already have been arrested because of the genocide, those who have sacrificed tirelessly, even though they have no reason to, those like Jill Stein.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1

By voting for a presidential candidate who is against the war and by rejecting a presidential candidate and by defeating her because she is supporting the genocide.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
We need to defeat Harris in Michigan.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"If we can defeat Harris in Michigan, that would be a political earthquake.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
Kamala Harris has the billionaires on her side. They are euphoric about her.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1

"It is ground zero to punish Kamala Harris and defeat her and send a message that no candidate, no party that supports genocide will have our votes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1

Are you ready to fight: so we are fighting for every vote to defeat Kamala Harris in the state of Michigan. ,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
The Biden-Harris administration recently approved a record-setting $23 billion on top of the billions that have already been sent to fund the Israeli military.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"So they are not doing what they say, but they do have the power.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
We must hold them to account because it's simple.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,0
I think people are feeling re-engaged and that people are really hoping that Kamala Harris does respond to the demands of uncommitted because people are ready to support.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"People want to mobilize, people want to be able to support her.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
I think for Harris it's a prime opportunity right now where she has this moment to really unite a fractured party.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
So Kamala Harris just got some bad news.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"You know, it's kind of like at this point, every single day, she's getting bad news.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
And so what we're going to do is react to this interview and show you additional clips to justify why this is a big problem for her campaign.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"That's for sure, who's voting for Kamala Harris here: Absolutely, no.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"Now, before I get to showing you the electoral college map and how Michigan could be one of the reasons why she will lose this election, let's take a look at this interview she did right after her rally today.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
And I think it just kind of justifies why people feel the way that they do towards her.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"After every single interview that she's done, all of her rallies, we still don't know Kamala Harris.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
And I'm definitely doubting Michigan as it pertains to Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
So it literally blows up her election chances.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
She is not willing to show us who she really is.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
They don't know who she is.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"And what they do know is not good, which is she shares some level of responsibility as it pertains to how she's handled the Hamas and Israel war even after Biden dropped out.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"Their her statements are very canned, they're not relatable.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
Is there a difference: she hasn't shown that when they ask her about Joe Biden and how she would be different.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
She still gives us canned answers.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
Kamala Harris represents the unknown.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
And that is a disaster for Kamala Harris.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,-1,-1
"But the margins are so slim, one thing to think about though, look at the three where Harris does have a small, small advantage.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
"If she does hold Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, if there's no surprise anywhere else, she will have exactly 270 electoral votes.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,0

"But the recent polling shows Kamala Harris up slightly in Michigan, what does the vice president need to do to close the deal in your state: well, we knew that Michigan was going to be close coming into this election.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
And the volunteer energy since she came to the top of our ticket has been palpable.,Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1

"My mother is a General Motors retiree. And the fact that she sees a vision for it, she will commit to keeping investments that have already been committed to in the state of Michigan for power for new auto plants.",Kamala Harris,Michigan,1,1
