 Let's take a look at the state of Michigan and sort of what's happened there recently. So 2020 presidential election, President Biden, the Democratic nominee, won by basically three percentage points there and let's call it 150,000 votes or so. But let me give you a historical sort of representation of what happened. So in 2016, look at that. Hillary Clinton got 47 percent of the vote in Michigan. Joe Biden beat that by more than three points. Conversely, Donald Trump basically stayed the same, flat there at the high 47 percent range. One of the questions, what about this, that third party candidate vote and the uncommitted vote, what happens? This go around. So let me take you real quick to Washtenaw County. And that's a big county there. University of Michigan is there, very Democratic county, as you can see. Joe Biden picked up 72 percent of the vote there again, did substantially better than Hillary Clinton in 2016. Why am I talking about Washtenaw County? Here's why.
