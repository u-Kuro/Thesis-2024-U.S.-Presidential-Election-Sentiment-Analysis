 I am very happy that President Biden dropped out of the race because that was an impossible task for me to convince anybody, including myself, to vote for him. I think people are feeling re-engaged and that people are really hoping that Kamala Harris does respond to the demands of uncommitted because people are ready to support. People want to mobilize. People want to be able to support her. People want to be able to ensure that Trump does not become president in November. I think one of the prime pathways to ensuring that doesn't happen is to again respond to the movement's calls of ensuring a ceasefire and not another bomb be dropped in Palestine. They say the path to the White House is through Michigan. Michigan runs through Detroit. Michigan runs through Dearborn. Some key areas where there's a number of voters, Arab American voters in Michigan, can sway the election. Consider, Donald Trump has openly vowed if re-elected he'll be a dictator on day one. But as candidate Harris makes her case, I think more and more of the Arab Americans would realize that she is an improvement over the Biden policy and she's certainly a huge improvement over what Trump would be. So I hope the Arab American community would recognize that and would vote for her in droves because the alternative is dreadful. I think for Harris it's a prime opportunity right now where she has this moment to really unite a fractured party. And it's a party that's been fractured particularly on the whole issue that's happening in Gaza and in Palestine. So today we are in a listening mode. However when it comes to November 5, we are not going to be in a listening mode. We're going to be talking and they will be listening.
