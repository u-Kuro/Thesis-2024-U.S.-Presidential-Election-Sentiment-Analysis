 Tuesday night, a string of debate watch parties were held throughout West Michigan News Channel three went to three of them. One for Harris. When Kamala Harris became the nominee for president, we as democrats, his folks with progressive values were able to switch from defense to offense. One for Trump. For me, that's what it's all about is trying to rebuild our country and one full of young and college educated voters, which political experts have already said is the main voter demographic being targeted for the 2024 presidential election. Something that I would like to see with our next president is real change, real action, not somebody who just talks, but somebody who puts action behind their words.
