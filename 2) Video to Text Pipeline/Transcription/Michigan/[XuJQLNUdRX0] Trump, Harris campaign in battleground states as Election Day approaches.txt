 Rob, here we go. That election two weeks from tomorrow and the full court press by both presidential candidates has intensified. Voters in Illinois heading to the polls this morning as early voting expanded. Thousands of people have chosen to cast their vote early this year. And a new fundraising effort tonight in Chicago to power a push through the swing states. Governor JB Pritzker hosting former President Obama for a Democratic fundraiser. Early voting starts tomorrow in Wisconsin. And the Vice President Kamala Harris campaigning there with former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming. Appealing to Republicans who do not want to vote for Donald Trump. There are moments in the history of our country which challenge us, each of us, to really decide do we stand for those things that we talk about. Including a particular country over party. The former president, Mr. Trump, touring damage from Hurricane Helene in battleground North Carolina and pitching himself to voters during a rally. This election is a choice between whether we will have a four, I think of this, four more years. Could you stand it? Four more years of incompetence, stupidity and failure and disaster. Or whether we will begin the four greatest years of the history of our country. And so a new Washington Post poll shows an extremely tight contest in the battleground states. Vice President Harris has a slight edge in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. While the former president leads in Arizona and North Carolina. Nevada at this point is tied. And of course millions of people have already voted early in many of those swing states. Rob?
