 don't underestimate the power you all have more than those ads those long signs those billboards you all have more power to turn out people that understand we got to fight back against corporate greed in our country. The one thing I got to remind you all when you talk to people and you know we're one of swing states that you can vote straight democrat you know a lot of people don't know that but one thing you got to remember you know you got the state house you got the state senate they're all a barrier against corporate greed but I want to remind you this how many of you all support paid sick leave raise your hand yes how many of you support an increase in minimum wage now I want you to think about this there was a ballot measure in our state until the republicans came you know they like cheating they came and they said nah we're going to undermine you and pass these amendments in the state legislature to undermine them but who fought back and said nah you're not going to do that it was the Michigan Supreme Court that made that decision the Michigan Supreme Court said we will have paid sick leave in the state of Michigan we will increase minimum wage because the people spoke and they demanded it happen and thank god for groups like mothering justice who fought back
