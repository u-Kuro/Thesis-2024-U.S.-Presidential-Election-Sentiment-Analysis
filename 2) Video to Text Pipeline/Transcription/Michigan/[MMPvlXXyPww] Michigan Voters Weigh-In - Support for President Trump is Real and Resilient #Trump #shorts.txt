 For this election, would you say your mind is made up? Yes. And that is? Trump. Okay. Are you a previous Trump supporter? The first year he won in 2016, I was not. Did you vote for Hillary? I did vote for Hillary. Okay. But I cried when she did not win. Okay. Then what happened? And then I just felt like he did a good job. You believe you were better off four years ago. Oh, absolutely. Small business owner Andrew Cingrati backs Trump, too. I knew I had enough to make things last the rest of my life. Now I'm kind of questioning it if I should maybe go back to work part-time. Both friends are backing Trump. I don't like him as a person. I'll admit it. But I think he's the best thing for the country. How will you feel if Trump doesn't win? I am. Petrified. And so I talked to 20 voters. Not one of them was undecided. Wow. Not one. Not one. And headlines come and go. But let me tell you this. Support for former President Trump is real and resilient.
