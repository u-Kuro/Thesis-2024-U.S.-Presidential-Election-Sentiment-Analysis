 Former President Donald Trump is being sued by voters in Michigan to prevent him from running for president in 2024. The lawsuit alleges that Trump violated the 14th Amendment's disqualification clause by calling for an attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Similar lawsuits have been filed in Minnesota and Colorado. The disqualification clause of the 14th Amendment prohibits any person from holding public office if they have participated in an insurrection or rebellion against the U.S. government. The lawsuit, filed by Free Speech for People, argues that Trump's actions on January 6 meet the definition of an insurrection and that he is no longer eligible for public office. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and called the lawsuit a witch hunt. The outcome could have significant implications for the 2024 presidential election.
