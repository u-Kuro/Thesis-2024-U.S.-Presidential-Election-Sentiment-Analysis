 I want to tell you my story and the cause was you wanted it. And that is when they were putting Saddam on trial. Every front page since October 7 has the Palestinian issue on the front page. Here's one about Gaza genocide in its nine month and that's the offer that got from Jill Stein and Tal Hamid. We are in the listening mode right now. We wanted to see what kind of Kamala Harris will be out of the shadow of Joe Biden and his administration. So far we have seen some positive signs, some cracks in the doors, opening but not all wide open. We need to keep the conversation going. If Kamala wants my vote, I want her to take a hard stance against these forever wars. I want her to take a hard stance against giving Israel any more money, especially for military purposes. I want her to take a strong stance in supporting the Palestinian plight and in supporting their right to exist. Giving us crumbs isn't going to sway me anymore. We don't want any more performances. We don't want any more performative statements and we don't want anyone to come and fool us and give us a bunch of false hope to get our votes. We want long lasting permanent change. Both candidates are going to say whatever they have to say to win this election. It doesn't mean they're going to do whatever they say. She can come out tomorrow and be like, hey, ceasefire, we're going to stop funding this war and we're going to move on. That's great. I mean, that's part of the problem. I want to vote for the Democratic Party. Traditionally I voted for Democrats, local, state and federal elections. But I got to see, I don't know, Vice President Harris, I don't know her that well. She hasn't been right out there. She's been pretty invisible in this throughout Biden's term in office.
