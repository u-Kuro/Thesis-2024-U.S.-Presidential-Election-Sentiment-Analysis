 first of 5 30 we continue to follow the road to the 270 electoral votes needed to elect our next president political reporter Rick Albin in studio now with analysis of where things stand right now Well, I can tell you guys they're as tight as I've ever seen them and it doesn't seem to be changing much right now There are seven states that will make the decision about who the next president of the United States will be We'll start with this all of these that are red and blue right now are close enough in the polls That it's projected that they will vote either red for Republican or blue for Democrats typical Democratic states California Washington Oregon Illinois and then the South and Midwest states that you would expect to vote for Republicans So while that's not a guarantee it's pretty good guess that that's where there's gonna go So if you take a look at those that have already been accounted for that's 226 electoral votes for Harris seven less for Trump at 2019 so how do you get there? Well for Trump the quickest way the most efficient way would be for him to win in Georgia, North Carolina and in Pennsylvania that takes him immediately to 270 but right now in North Carolina He's only up in the polls since the average of polls by about four-tenths of a point his highest lead is 1.2% actually 2.5% in Georgia So all of these are really really close and again, it's too close to call But I'm just using this as an example, by the way There are about 20 combinations for both sides that would get them to 270 Let's just say for a moment that Trump Trump loses in North Carolina that takes him back to 254 What if he wins Michigan that's gonna leave him one short at 269. He's got to pick up another state so it becomes complex you would like to get as Two states as possible that you have to win in order to get to that 270 for Harris It's again pretty simple. You've got to get the states that get you to 270 So I've got to change this back and now I can change it back to Harris So if she wins, Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania There she is at 270 and she is done what has been done so many times before and that's when that blue wall That goes right through Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. That's how Trump did it in 2016. We'll see what happens this year
