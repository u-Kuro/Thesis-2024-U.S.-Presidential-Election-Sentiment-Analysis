 In the final stretch of the 2024 US presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris is focusing her efforts on winning over young voters in Michigan, a critical battleground state. College campuses across Michigan have become a political battlefield, with students holding the key to flipping the state. Despite Harris leading narrowly in the polls, a surprising, uncommitted movement is emerging, and even a small number of holdouts could swing the entire election. As Harris tours the state, addressing the youth's concerns about climate change, student debt, and jobs, the race grows tighter. Will her outreach efforts solidify the youth vote, or will these uncommitted voters remain on the sidelines, possibly deciding the next president of the United States?
