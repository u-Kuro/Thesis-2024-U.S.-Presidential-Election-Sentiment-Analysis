 I gotta tell you, I'm pissed off. I'm angry. This is not a Democrat or Republican issue. This is American jobs. This is helping communities. And J.D. Vance, in one fell swoop, put all of that at risk here in Lansing. They'd rather kill union jobs and let China lead the way to the future of the industry. Vance and Trump will let Michigan manufacturing's plants close, just like Trump did. They're gonna send us backwards. We can't go back. Going back means cutting $500 million from the Lansing Grand River plant. We can't go back. I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican. If you are a worker, if you're an American worker, if you are an American union worker here in Lansing, here in Michigan, anywhere in the United States, the choice is clear. And they just made it even more clear yesterday. So I hope everyone in Lansing and the country is paying attention. I hope you're angry like I am. These are our jobs. These are our shifts. These are our workers. We need to make sure that that $500 million continues and stays. Don't let Trump and Vance throw it away.
