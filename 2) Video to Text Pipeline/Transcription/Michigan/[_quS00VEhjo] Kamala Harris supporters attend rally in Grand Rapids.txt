 I support her because she's for women's right. I believe she'll be a president for all people. And I believe she loves America, and she's trying to save our democracy. This is one of the most serious elections in my lifetime, and Trump is a danger to democracy. We support Harris because I think we have a really unique opportunity to finally get our first female president, especially a president who has a long record of being friendly to workers' rights, and that's a big reason why we're here today, is to continue supporting candidates who believe in workers' rights. My number one reason for supporting her is for the future generations. This is for my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren. Why? I'm really concerned about the direction that I see what's going on in the country. When I hear federal immunity, I see black and I see brown, and I see boys. Then I see young men who will be killed. These officers will have no justification. Then I see those babies that they're leaving behind with the generational of the same cycle of crime. So I'm voting because I'm voting for not Bonita, but for the future of our country. I support her economic plan. I vote for her because of the climate change problem that we're having in our world and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. I think she should be a good president. I think she's competent. I'm sorry that the bar is so low, but I believe she's proven herself. She has what it takes, and I think in foreign policy as well. I think she's going to do just fine. At this point, I'm just happy that we're moving forward. I feel like we're going in the right direction, but I'm also gravely concerned. We're not going back! We're not going back! Because when we fight, we win! When we fight, we win! And when we don't, we lose!
