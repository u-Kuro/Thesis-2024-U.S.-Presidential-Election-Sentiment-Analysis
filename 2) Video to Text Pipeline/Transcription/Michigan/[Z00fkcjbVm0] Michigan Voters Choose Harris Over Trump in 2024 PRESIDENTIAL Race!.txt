First up, the latest poll from Quinnipiac University shows Kamala Harris leading by five points over Donald Trump. That's a significant margin. Next, Marist College compared likely voters with registered voters in a tight two-candidate race, where Harris led by three and five points, respectively. But here's where things get really interesting. According to Morning Consult, Trump scored 44%, while Harris took the lead with 52%. However, an Emerson College poll shows the race tightening, Trump at 49%, and Harris edging out with 50%. Quite the contrast from earlier, don't you think? As we move to the poll from Suffolk University, Trump trails at 45%, with Harris ahead at 48%. However, the garrows even further in the Redfield and Wilton Strategies poll, where Trump hits 45%, and Harris holds a slim lead at 46%. Finally, Morning Consult conducted four different polls comparing various voter types. What's fascinating is the near-identical opinions between the groups. Harris consistently edges out with an average three-point lead. What do you think? Will this momentum continue, or will we see a shift?
