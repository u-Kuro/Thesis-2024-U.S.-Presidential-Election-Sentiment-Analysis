 And I think we've seen that the current president can barely finish a sentence without gas being for breath and that the person from New York that we thought was such a bombastic belt billard is not the case at all. He's a really thoughtful and capable man. I think it's been a wonderful evening. He just he cannot think on his feet at all. President Trump is just on it. He knows exactly what he's talking about. And President Biden just doesn't seem like he's with it at all. He doesn't have any answers. It's really sad that this man is put in front of the public in this condition. I feel sorry for him. I really do because it's an embarrassment.
