 Free Palestine! Stop the genocide! This group of voters who are sort of basing their decisions around this election, not even in terms of vote choice, but do I turn out and vote through basing it on the war policies of the Biden-Harris administration. Hello, my name is Hind Omar. I am 30 years old and I am originally from Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Democratic Party currently, the current administration, is making it extremely difficult and a moral dilemma for me and us to endorse and give our vote. There's a few weeks left to election day and a lot can happen within that time and I really do want to give my vote to that party, being the Democratic Party, and I really do want my community to support the Democratic Party, but I also understand that a concession needs to be made. My name is Anna Sperry. I am 19 years old. I will be 20 when I vote. I am from Traverse City, Michigan. I'm sworn between voting for a third party and voting for Harris. If she came out and said that we would stop sending arms to Israel, I think that would make me feel a lot better about my vote. I'm juggling between third party and Democrat and Kamala and Trump seen somewhere far behind. Maybe he'll come and save if she doesn't change her position.
