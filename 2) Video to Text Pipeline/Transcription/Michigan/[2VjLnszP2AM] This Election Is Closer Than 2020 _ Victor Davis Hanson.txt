 Donald Trump lost the electoral college by an aggregate of somewhere between 45 and 60,000 votes last time. He won in 2016 despite losing the popular vote. And most people believe that this election is closer than 2016 and 2020. So any little indication like a vice presidential debate can make a difference. If it just made a difference in 100,000 votes and those votes were strategically located in Pennsylvania or Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, it could make a big difference. We also have these what we call in America, the October surprises. Those are usually things that the incumbent does to sway or influence the electorate in a favorable way into the disadvantage of their opponents.
