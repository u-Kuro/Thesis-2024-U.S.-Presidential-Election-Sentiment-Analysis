Just because I've seen Trump as the president, you feel me? I mean, yeah, it's cheaper, you feel me? But I just... I feel like she would be a better president. Trump, you wanna know why? Because Trump supposed to be the Lord of Texas. So when we do an overtime, it's supposed to be like, you know... Good money. I don't think either one is better because they're both funny and genocide. Harris. Why? She just stands for what I believe in. I can't put my vote to somebody who is pro-genocide. I'm just not for Trump. If they had a different Republican in there, that wasn't Trump, maybe, but...
