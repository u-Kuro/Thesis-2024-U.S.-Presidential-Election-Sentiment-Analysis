 The mayor of Hamtramck, this is a city of 30,000 people that's totally surrounded by Detroit. The mayor is a Muslim mayor, it's an all-Muslim city council, he's a lifelong Democrat, he just endorsed Donald Trump. I was walking around Hamtramck, there's an auto dealer there, a Bangladeshi guy, he's flying his vote for Trump thing. And that's not just because of Israel, they're the state party, like Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the Attorney General, Dana Nessel, they came and chastised the local government for not flying a pride flag on their city flag poles.
