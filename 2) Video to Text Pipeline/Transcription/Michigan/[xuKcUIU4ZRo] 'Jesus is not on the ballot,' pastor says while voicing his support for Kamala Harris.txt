 But to me, it is important that we elect a person that is capable of showing love to all of the people, not just to a few. Amen. And to act in a right and proper manner. Amen. So I believe that this election is an election that we get someone that could actually guide us and protect us and protect our Constitution and protect what this nation stands for. Amen. Against all threats, external and internal. So I think that we have an obligation, amen, that we elect a person like that. Now, I say this often, amen, in the pulpit that my vote is always for Jesus. Hallelujah, somebody. But since Jesus' name is not on the ballot, oh, hallelujah, somebody. Amen. And I am persuaded that I will vote for Vice President Carmela Harris and Governor, hallelujah, somebody, Tim Walz. Amen. I think that they are the best candidates for such a time as this.
