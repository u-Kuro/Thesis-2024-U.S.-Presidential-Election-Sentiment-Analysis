 In an exclusive new poll this morning, voters are indicating a slight change in how they're leaning as we enter the last days before the election. Political reporter Rick Albin breaks down the new numbers right now. The numbers from our pollsters at Epic MRA vary from some of the other surveys we've seen in the last month. Though they stay with the trend of having Vice President Harris and former President Trump in a very tight race in the state. Going back to the polls in the field since the 24th of October, there have been two ties. Two that show Trump up by one and one that shows Harris up by one. Today, the Epic poll shows Harris with a three-point lead over Trump at 48 to 45 percent. Significantly, neither candidate is over 50 percent and the margin of error is plus or minus 4 percent. Out of the 600 likely voters asked, 47 percent said they would vote for the Democratic candidate for United States Senate, Alyssa Slotkin. 42 percent prefer Republican Mike Rogers for a difference of five percentage points. When it comes to issues, this poll tracks with what we've been seeing for months, with the economy and costs of living at 30 percent, number one issue. Other polls, when including housing prices in the equation, have been as high as 60 percent. Today's Epic MRA poll also places as a concern abortion and reproductive health at 18 percent. That's higher in both percentage and placement at the number two issue. Immigration and fitness for office round out the top four concerns. The takeaway is this. As a snapshot of a moment in time, 600 of your neighbors let their concerns and preferences be known between October 24th and October 28th. We're in the midst of early in-person voting, that concludes on Sunday, and people have been absentee voting for weeks. The final poll will wrap up Tuesday night at 8 p.m. when we start seeing results of all the voting, which is the poll that ultimately matters. I'm Rick Albin.
