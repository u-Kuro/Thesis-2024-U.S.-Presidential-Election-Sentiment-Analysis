 My very young son, of all of 24 years old, was married last year. And the day that Biden stepped down, he called me up and said, what are we gonna do, Mom? My wife's already told me that if Trump gets another turn, we're gonna have to move to Canada because she is not going to be a second class citizen or a possession. For those that are undecided, I would ask them to open up their minds, get off social media, quit listening to your mother's brothers, sisters, aunts, and uncles, do your own research and actually field and vet the individuals that are on the ballot. Look at what their practice and policies have been. Look at the things that they have voted for and against, and make your decision based on the closest to your own world. And I'm gonna ask them to open up their minds. And I'm gonna ask them to open up their minds.
