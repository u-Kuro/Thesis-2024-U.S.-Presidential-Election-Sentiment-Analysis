 All right we are recording. Mr. Mayor, share with us what it means to have vice president and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris here in technically Lansing, but Lansing to speak to workers at New York. Well it's extremely important you know we know that that this election is going to be decided by a few states and we know that Michigan is one of those few. This is we're ground zero right here and when you look at what happened just a week or two ago when JD Vance comes in and says 500 million dollars for American workers for our auto plant are now at risk. This is the place to be you know the Trump Vance ticket has to explain why are they taking five why would they take 500 million dollars away from American workers and yet you've got Vice President Harris who is talking about supporting American workers and supporting our manufacturing industry and being a president for everyone. So for her to come here at ground zero where where it was said where it would affect our workers and where it would affect our economy I appreciate her being here I hope I hope the other side comes and tells us why they're they're looking to take that away. You know as vice president it's great for her to be here just to show that the administration cares about mid-michigan about Lansing about our area so I think as a vice president and as the presidential candidate this shows the importance of Lansing it shows the importance of Michigan it shows that that they find that the Midwest is important this isn't just New York and California it's not the coasts this is the Midwest being important and Lansing being the capital city of Michigan shows our importance in Lansing. Yeah I think that that vice president Harris and her direct surrogates you talk about the vice president being in Michigan numerous times you talk about Tim Wals a vice presidential candidate being in Michigan numerous times we saw Gwen Wals we saw Doug Emhoff we've had all kinds of different surrogates here so yeah I think that they are taking it very seriously they they understand the importance of the blue wall they understand the importance of Michigan I get to compete with some mayors in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin we joke around about how many times Kamala Harris or Tim Wals or any of their surrogates are here in Michigan versus Wisconsin and Pennsylvania we've added in Arizona we've added in North Carolina yeah they're here a lot and they should be and she's here a lot and she should be so I appreciated between Lansing and Detroit Grand Rapids Flint she's been to a lot of the the major areas and they've invited people from all over the state to be here and to see her and let her hear her message let us hear her message I think it's fantastic and I think it shows the importance of Michigan that we will not be taken for granted we vote based on on the candidate and we want to hear from that candidate and she's here and she is telling us why she is going to be the best president United States let's talk a little bit down ballot yeah we got Curtis or tell and Tom Barrett the 7th congressional district polls are very very tight yeah what's your sense as you're going door-to-door and on these campaign events and talking to people what are you hearing in terms of the outcome? yeah I think Curtis is going to win I think it's gonna be very close you know there's there's no one who thinks this is gonna be a 10-point race in either direction it's always been very close here in in our congressional district what was the 8th and now is the 7th but I actually have been out knocking doors for the campaign and you know people see Curtis as you know they know he got a lot done for them when he was in the state Senate they know that that he's got the experience we need but they also think he's just you know the everyday guy who is going to be our next congressman I think people have big concerns when it comes to Tom Barrett and some of the the extreme conservative policies he supported and pushed for in the state Senate including his abortion stances being you know no abortion at all for anyone anytime I think that's that's a real concern for folks that if he were to if Tom Barrett were to get into Congress he would be one of those folks that that deposed the Republican speaker and one of those folks that is going to be a right-wing person that is not going to really help our district so it's gonna be close and that's that's always this congressional district but I think I think Curtis does what Alyssa Slotkin did in her first race when she ran in this district which is talk to all the people all the time and and win in the end but it'll be close yeah tomorrow speaker Johnson is gonna be here in Lansing campaigning for Tom Barrett yeah does that indicate with that level of national surrogacy coming in is that an indication that the seventh congressional seat here in Michigan is really one of the key seats for control of the US House absolutely control of Congress goes through the seventh congressional district every seat is tremendously important there are certainly you know a handful you know eight ten seats there's few in New York there's a you know there's one in Oregon but we've got two to three of them here in Michigan and there's a reason you know all these folks are coming here and raising money and talking to voters when you see Hakeem Jeffries who will be the next speaker of the house here we know that this is an important seat yeah when you see the current speaker of the house here for Tom Barrett we know that that they need to try and get their people out and the Dems need to try and get their people out so yes the the control of the next Congress is going to run through Lansing it's going to run through Shiawassee and it's going to run through Livingston and it's going to run through Ingham Eaton and Clinton counties part of Oakland and it's important and I'm glad to see that their folks are coming here but the reality is the candidates are going to speak to how they're going to serve and I think Curtis Hertel is the candidate for everybody he's got Republicans that are supporting him you know he's got former members of Congress and the legislature and others who know that he'll be the best candidate for everyone so I think that wins out at the end well we're at we're at about 50% return it was just with the clerk minutes ago yes right that's right here in Lansing I mean the only thing you didn't ask is is the US Senate I mean when you talk about Michigan and our importance I would argue the presidential race is going through Michigan you got to win Michigan to be the next president the Congress the US House of Representatives is going to run through Michigan with the 7th district as well as you know over in Grand Rapids even into Macomb County that's going to run through Michigan and the US Senate there is no way the Democrats hold the US Senate or it becomes a tie without Alyssa Slocan being our next US senator so all three branches are not all three branches all three parts of both branches the presidency as well as both houses of Congress are dependent on this congressional district in this state and there's a lot of pressure on our voters but it means that our voters are paying attention and they're educating themselves and they're going to go to the ballot and I do think that the Democrats come out on top because they want to be for all people I mean when you look in your Republicans and you look at the top of the ticket you've got a president presidential candidate that's talking about retribution that's tearing down the city of Detroit that's tearing down our state in order to try and win votes and I just I don't think that's going to work with folks that aren't already for him it's that's not going to win over new votes as opposed to a presidential candidate in Kamala Harris who's going to be a president for everybody and you look at you know the Congress that she needs to get things done and you have Curtis or tell and Alyssa Slocan we just we have the right candidates here and I think that's going to make a difference for me is January 6th you and I talked shortly after that because we had an event coming up at the state capitol yeah there were great concerns about potential issues yes yes Trump has said that January 6th was a lot right what is your response to that January 6th was a nightmare for this country people just look at the scenes look at the scenes that were on WLNS look at the scenes that that you can't make this up you can't have revisionist history and say that it wasn't one of the worst days in our nation's history when it comes to democracy and I am extremely concerned about what will happen this year if the election is tight in Michigan I am extremely concerned about what will happen at our capitol we are the capital city and people are going to come here and we're preparing for that because you know four years ago as you know we had to call out the National Guard because we were told they're going to be riots and the Capitol Commission had to fence the capital when you talk about electors coming into town and casting their vote I do think I do think Kamala Harris is going to win I do think Kamala Harris is going to win and I think it's going to be close and I am concerned about what what happens next when you have a presidential when you have a presidential candidate that refuses to say he's going to accept the results if it's not him that to me is it's very concerning so something I'm going to keep my eye on and that we are preparing for
