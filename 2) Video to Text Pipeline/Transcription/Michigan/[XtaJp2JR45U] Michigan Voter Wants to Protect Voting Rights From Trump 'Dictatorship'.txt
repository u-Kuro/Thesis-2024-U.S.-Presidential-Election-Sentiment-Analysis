 I'm afraid that we won't get to vote anymore. I'm afraid that this is a dictatorship on the way in. Unfortunately, that is not what I'd like to see for the future of our country. I think that voting is something that a lot of people have died for, and it's a right that is absolutely worth protecting. And the number one thing is to make sure that they get out and vote. I would encourage people to remember that there are processes in this country that are very important and we hold dear. And if they're deciding between two people, go back to the basics and remember why we're here.
