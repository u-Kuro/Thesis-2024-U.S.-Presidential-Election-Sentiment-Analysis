 don't fall for the Michigan primary results trap. I think many Republicans are falling for this actually. So I I'm a old school guy. I keep my stuff on a piece of paper. I like numbers. I just do I like stats. I've always liked it. I love value line data from the old days. I love baseball stats, football stats, and never really gotten hockey stats very much because I never played the game. But I love basketball stats, baseball, football, basketball, 100%. And I like voting stats, I think it's very, very interesting. Always love geography, always love maps, always like population sizes, whatnot. I think Republicans are making a huge mistake and falling for this. Well, the Michigan primary, it just shows you that Joe Biden is on his last word. I just I'm telling you, man, I'm gonna show you otherwise. So I want to share with you guys some first and foremost is that you're not gonna see this very well. But I looked at this right here is a population size of Michigan going from 2000 to 2008. 2016. And right now, you see it's basically 10 million people, 10 million people in the state of Michigan hasn't really changed at all. All right. I'm going to show you the level of from those same years, this is the GOP primary 1.1 million in 2000. Right here. Alright, so that's when there's an open election. Alright, Clinton was getting ready to his service term. So we had open election. So McCain running against Bush and McCain actually won. 2008 was an open election. Alright, George W. Bush was gone. So in another open election 2008. Alright, that's when both parties have candidates they want to win. There's no incumbent. And our Republicans went from 1.1 million to 835,000 pretty significant drop. And then we of course we got crushed. We actually we didn't get crushed. We Sarah Palin when she came on the ticket, we got stupid t shirt on this dress, driving me crazy. She energized Republicans that we were actually right freakin right there with stinking Obama. But then McCain because he just sucked. He royally just sucked. He's not gonna suspend my campaign. It's just so freakin stupid dude. Anyway, I just is idiotic. And after that, all it was all she wrote, what it just want to fool that guy. Anyway, so you can see a massive drop off from 1.1 to 835,000. In 2016, another open election is still less than it was in 2000. 16 years later, still less than it was in 2000. 987,000 people in the primary another open election. This year won't be an open election because Biden is the incumbent in theory. Alright, so this year, we actually had a pretty good turnout, a better turnout than 2016. Over almost 1.1 million, basically. And again, the population size is roughly the same. So you can't attribute to population size. It's really just motivation. Alright, so that that's good. So everyone's like, hey, you know, Trump, right? That's better than it was in 2008 2016. And as much better than it was in 2020 when Trump is the incumbent. That's why I want to show people here. So we're gonna show you right here. Trump was the incumbent in 2016. He only had 640,000 voters. That was it. Right now it's this freaking idiot Bill. Shouldn't say that these two fools bill will shouldn't say that these two was a good word. People. They didn't do anything. So we got uncommitted here. So Trump got 640,000 votes. All right. What did Biden get this time in 2024? 623,000. 623,000. Now Biden is the incumbent. Trump only got 640. Biden got 623. Now Biden went on to win Michigan and you know, at the end of the day, it's 150,000 votes. It wasn't nearly as close it was for Trump in 2016. Whatever you want to say about that. Biden won pretty decisively. That's just a fact. Right. So you can say, well, look, Trump's numbers in 2020 were low. Biden's numbers are low here as well. And then people are gonna say, look at all these uncommitted votes. Yet 100,000 uncommitted people like 100,000 people did not want to vote for Biden. All right, you think that's check this out. Watch this and I'll show you something. Here's 2008. Hillary only got 328,000. There's uncommitted was 238,000. All right, because Brock wasn't even on the ballot for some reason. I don't know why he got no vote, but he got delegates. I don't know what that's about. No, we just went outside. So you can see here in 2008, basically Democrats only had 600,000 votes and in 2008 Republicans had more. Republicans had 835,000 votes in their primary. The Democrats only had 600,000. Now one of the reasons maybe is because of previous years, the Democrats were in a caucus, which is a caucus is kind of like Iowa, Maine used to have a caucus. I don't know if they still do or not anymore. A caucus is basically the back room smoke filled back rooms. So I'm not sure if Obama was able to get on the primary. I don't know. But there's a massive amount of uncommitted you can say those are just Obama votes. Either way, they have less turnout in 2008 than the Republicans did in terms of their primary and this is an open election. Alright, so again, right here, but basically 600,000 people we go to primary year 2008 Republican, we're gonna go to Michigan, right? What was it? Scrolling down, scrolling down. And here's Michigan. So do we have more enthusiasm for the Republicans? Now you could also argue too, that the Republicans have less voters in the Michigan than Democrats do. But it's not as much as you think. There's a pretty significant according to Gallup believes there's a pretty sizable minority of independent voters. Actually, they're all three are minorities. Republicans are roughly 30 Democrats are roughly 40, 35 to 40, give or take and their independence of the rest. It depends on what year you look at. But generally speaking, Republicans trail Democrats, but not nearly as significant as you think. And so you can't sit there and say, Oh, my goodness, Republicans are under the over saintly, they had more motivation. I mean, you can say this in their 2008 primary relative to the voting size and the Democrats did because the Democrats only had 600,000 people that turn out with a higher voter, part affiliation. But what happened? Well, we got trounced, the Republicans got trounced, right? Even though there is 235,000 people uncommitted and Hillary still won in terms of democratic primary. And where I'm going with this, I'm just sitting there thinking, huh, because now we look at 2024. Right here. So here's Trump, you only got 64. But here's Biden, look at that between Biden, Bernie, this guy and her, they had 1.4 million people vote in the 2020 primary. Again, I get it the COVID I get all that but still 1.4 million people. Trump only had 640. That's significant. Now you can make an argument and I don't think it's valid that in 2024 Biden got 623,000. So they dropped by less than by more than half. But it's because he's the incumbent. He's the incumbent. You can make an argument. Well, that means the democratic enthusiasm is flailing. I just I don't think so. I just think the incumbent because remember, Trump got in 2016, there's almost a million primary voters in Michigan. In 2020, there's again 640,000 for the Republicans I'm saying. So pretty significant drop off and Trump got shellacked. But even when Trump won in 2016, he won by like 10,000 votes. That's it. So even if that is indicative of the lack of enthusiasm for Joe Biden, it might well be. We've been the Republicans have been here before we smoked we had 1.1 million voters in the primary in 2020. In 2000, we got smoked in Michigan. We had more voters in us in in 2008 than the Democrats did. And we got smoked in Michigan as well. 2016 we had 987,000 voters, the Democrats had 1.2. And we we basically beat them by 10,000 votes. And there were general election I'm saying. And this year and we had 1.055 million where the Democrats have basically a little bit more than half of that. But again, they got an incumbent. But in 2020, they had 1.4 million and we only had I forgot what but I'll talk man I can't wait 600, 640,000. And I think a lot of people are misreading these are like, oh, Biden is not committed. Bubba, there's no commitment to Biden and all that. I just I'm telling you, man, I would be very hesitant to start, you know, measuring the drapes in the White House for Trump. Because look shenanigans aside, the facts are the Democrats, they have an unnatural advantage. They have more Democratic Party affiliation. That's just a fact. They have the media on their side. That's just a fact. And the media is gonna do whatever they can to portray the Democrats as a good guys and the Republicans as a bad and immediate still has influence man. I'm sorry, even on the right wing. I'm like, why you you know, I get these emails. Did you hear this story? Why? Why do you care? Well, the media is talking about Oh, drives me up the wall. I thought we're all trained now to disregard the media because he just lie. Well, still, I get it. The media still contains the controls the stories that the fact anyway, I'd be careful for I started freaking measuring the drapes. All right, God bless. I'll be here thoughts. Thanks now.
