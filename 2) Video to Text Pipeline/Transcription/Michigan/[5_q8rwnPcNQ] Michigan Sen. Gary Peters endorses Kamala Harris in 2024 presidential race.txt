 One Michigan senator has thrown his support behind current Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee. Our Al Myers caught up with the senator in Lansing today and brings us the latest on why he's excited to support Harris. It didn't take long for Michigan Senator Gary Peters to throw his endorsement behind current Vice President Kamala Harris after President Biden stepped away from the presidential race. Now Peters tells me the big question is who will be running by Harris' side. I know that Vice President Harris is going to have a choice of a lot of qualified individuals. The one thing that we have going for us as Democrats when it comes to a Vice President is we have a lot of great candidates. You know, that's a very deep edge. Peters told reporters after a Senate field hearing in Lansing that he quickly endorsed Harris for the nomination and noted just how quick he thinks the running mate selection will be. They're hearing a lot of names that are being put out now. There very well could be other names that are just not being talked about. But I know that Vice President Harris is going to have a choice of a lot of qualified individuals. But it will be a choice that will likely be made very quick because this is on an accelerated process and we'll know more in the next few days. Peters tells me he feels particularly heartened by Democrats coming together. I think the thing that's very exciting as a Democrat is the unity that we're seeing in our party right now. And when Kamala Harris was endorsed by the President and everybody across the party, all across the country, stepped up to say now let's come together and be unified with her, I think it bodes very well for the future.
