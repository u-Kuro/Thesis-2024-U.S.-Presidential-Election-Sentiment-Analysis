 widening gender gap and for more on the Harris campaign I want to bring in ABC News senior White House correspondent Selena Wang. Selena thanks for being here with us and we know that polls are tightening in this race and the vice president today again stopping in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin states that make up this Democrats right so-called blue wall. So Selena what kind of impact right now is the Harris campaign hoping that having Liz Cheney by her side again will have? Well today in these blue wall states Vice President Harris is really going after that narrow sliver of those undecided voters specifically suburban women those more moderate Republicans and independents they're really hoping that former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney is going to make a dent with some of those voters who may be unsure about Vice President Kamala Harris but are also frustrated and tired of Donald Trump and Harris's message to them is that they've got a home within the Democratic Party and Liz Cheney is making the pitch that it's because she's deeply conservative that she's backing Harris she says she's putting the Constitution over her party calling Donald Trump unchecked unstable and dangerous. Cheney also had a specific message about abortion for those women in the audience so back in 2022 Cheney had said that she supported the overturning of Roe versus Wade but her message today is that even if these voters support if they've even if these voters are anti-abortion rights her message is that they should still vote for Harris because those abortion bans have now gone too far and are putting women's lives at risk. Certainly a strong message there and Tim Walz as we know was on ABC's The View Today and Selina it seemed that perhaps he was a little more prepared to answer the question of how a Harris-Walls administration might differ from the current Biden-Harris administration what are we hearing from him? Yeah it was really interesting because Governor Walz gave a more concrete answer to this question about how Harris would be different from a Biden administration than Harris herself ever has he specifically said that she is going to be more focused on the care economy and child care stuff that has not been as much of the focus for the Biden administration take a listen to what else he said here. I think she's really leaning into these issues that impact people personally and then doubling down on whether it's housing or child tax credit those are those are pretty big differences and I don't think that's that's a pejorative towards it there were other issues that were being dealt with and she's her own leader she's got her own path a new way forward. And when Harris herself was on The View earlier this month when she was asked that very question she said she couldn't think of anything that she would have done differently compared to President Biden but then 30 minutes later into that interview she said she would appoint a Republican in her cabinet but Harris more recently now she's tried to draw a little more distance with President Biden saying that she will be a different president because of who she is her background in her policy focus but still struggling to get really specific and clearly articulate how she'd be different from the president and I can tell you I can I've been talking to some Democrats who say her real vulnerability is on the economy and articulating a clear vision there when so many Americans are frustrated with inflation even though it has been slowing down Kana. And Selena let's talk about some of these election experts that are right now expressing concern for Elon Musk's million dollar raffle right for registered voters in swing states who as Musk puts it have to sign a petition in support of the Constitution to be eligible I know that you asked the White House press secretary about that today what did she say. Yeah I asked the White House press secretary if she thinks this is appropriate if the president thinks this is appropriate at a time when you have some legal experts saying that what Elon Musk is doing is clearly a legal vote buying she essentially said that they've got to leave it up to the federal election Commission but take a listen to what else she said here. About how the president's reacting to this in terms of does he believe it's appropriate does he agree with what Governor Shapiro is saying about how this needs to be investigated. I will leave it to Governor Shapiro and the legal authorities to speak to this I'm just not going to speak to it from here we have to leave it to FEC. I also asked the press secretary about Trump vowing to name Elon Musk the head of a new government efficiency commission at a time when some experts have been raising concerns that this could be a conflict of interest because Elon Musk's companies have a lot of government contracts with these government agencies and that role could actually give them the power to regulate those very agencies that hold sway over his companies. On that point the press secretary had no comment. All right Selena Wang thank you for joining us this evening.
