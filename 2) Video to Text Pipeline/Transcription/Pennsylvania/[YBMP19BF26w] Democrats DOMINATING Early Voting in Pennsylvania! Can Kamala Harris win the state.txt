The buzz around Pennsylvania isn't just media hype. The data speaks for itself. Early voting in the Keystone state is painting a fascinating picture with Democrats surging ahead. Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is gaining momentum in the state, and this might be the defining edge she needs to clinch victory. But can she actually pull it off? Can Harris secure Pennsylvania and push herself past the finish line in this nail-biting election? Now, back to Pennsylvania's pivotal role. Pennsylvania holds 19 electoral votes, more than any other battleground state. Historically, this state has often determined the winner of presidential elections. In fact, Pennsylvanians have consistently chosen the winning candidate in 10 of the last 12 elections. But what makes this year different is the sheer intensity of early voting, and its tipping in favor of Harris. Why is this happening, and can this early voting wave ensure a Democratic win in November? With less than a month until election day, new polls show the two candidates virtually tied in this critical swing state. Here's a breakdown of where things stand, and why Pennsylvania could once again decide the election. Kamala Harris currently holds a razor-thin lead over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, leading by just 0.8 points in 538's polling average. In contrast, real clear politics shows them tied, and individual polls reflect the close nature of the race. A recent Emerson College poll from October 1, 2024, had both candidates at 48 percent, while a Bloomberg-Sawanar Morning Consult poll found Harris ahead by 5 points. In recent elections, Pennsylvania has been decided by razor-thin margins. Trump won the state by about 44,000 votes in 2016, and Biden flipped it in 2020 with a similarly tight margin. According to David Urban, who ran Trump's Pennsylvania operation in 2016, the 2024 election will likely come down to a difference of just 50,000 to 75,000 votes. Let's dig deeper into why Pennsylvania has such a pivotal role in the 2024 election. Remember 2020? It was Pennsylvania that pushed Joe Biden over the threshold of 270 electoral votes after a grueling four-day wait for the final count. This year feels eerily similar, except the dynamics are even more charged. The state's voters know their ballots carry immense weight. Both candidates are practically living in Pennsylvania, with Kamala Harris making multiple stops across the state and even participating in the Sept. 10 presidential debate held in, you guessed it, Pennsylvania. Donald Trump, meanwhile, is fighting to repeat his unexpected 2016 victory here when he became the first Republican in decades to win Pennsylvania. This year, however, the dynamics have shifted. While Trump still holds considerable sway over Pennsylvania's large white working-class population, 75 percent of the state identifies as non-Hispanic white. Harris is proving to be a formidable opponent. In fact, she's managed to close the gap among white voters, trailing Trump by only three points nationally compared to Biden's larger 12-point gap in 2020. And that gap? It's closing rapidly in Pennsylvania, where early voting numbers favor Democrats. The early turnout is high, with many Pennsylvanians voting ahead of time thanks to increased mail-in ballot access and heightened political engagement. But let's not get too ahead of ourselves. The question still stands. Will this early voting surge be enough for Harris to secure a win in Pennsylvania? We can't talk about Pennsylvania without discussing its significance in the electoral landscape. The state has been called the keystone of the Electoral College. Whoever wins here is often well on their way to victory. Pennsylvania's electoral votes have been the deciding factor in multiple elections, and that's especially true now, with 19 crucial votes up for grabs. Let's not forget that Pennsylvania is part of the so-called Blue Wall, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. These three states have often shifted between Democratic and Republican control, making them incredibly valuable to both parties. According to Nate Silver's election model, Pennsylvania is far and away the most important battleground this year, with a whopping 32% chance of tipping the election. That's higher than any other state in the country. Silver's model also predicts that Harris has an 88.8% chance of winning the entire election if she takes Pennsylvania. On the flip side, Trump has a 92.4% chance of winning the election if he flips Pennsylvania back to red. The stakes are that high. But what's driving the early voting surge in Pennsylvania? For one, the economy is top of mind for many voters. In a CBS YouGov survey, 82% of Pennsylvanians listed the economy as their number one issue. Inflation, too, is a key concern, with 78% of voters highlighting it as a major factor in their decision. The state of democracy itself is another huge talking point, with 70% of voters expressing anxiety over the future of the country's democratic institutions. These numbers are on par with the national electorate, but in Pennsylvania, these concerns are compounded by the state's divided political landscape. Pennsylvania has a Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, who enjoys widespread popularity. At the same time, the state legislature is split, with Democrats controlling the House and Republicans maintaining a majority in the Senate. This makes for an especially tense election atmosphere, as both parties are pulling out all the stops to mobilize their voter bases. For Trump, Pennsylvania holds personal significance. In July 2024, he was shot while speaking at a rally near Butler, a small town northwest of Pittsburgh. This shocking event only intensified the focus on Pennsylvania, cementing it as the most crucial battleground for both campaigns. Trump, a master of using personal narratives to energize his base, has continued to use this incident as a rallying cry, especially among the state's large, predominantly white working-class electorate. However, Trump's appeal to this demographic isn't the slam dunk it used to be. Harris, in her bid to win over white voters, has worked tirelessly to reshape her image and bridge the gap on key issues, particularly fracking. Pennsylvania is the second largest natural gas producer in the country, and Trump has attacked Harris relentlessly for her previous support of a fracking ban. He even went as far as accusing her of being against fracking for 12 years during their recent debate in Philadelphia. Harris, however, has since walked back her earlier stance, clarifying that she now supports the continued use of natural gas, particularly in light of the Inflation Reduction Act, which opens new gas leases. This issue is particularly sensitive for Pennsylvania's voters, and Harris's ability to defend her position could be a turning point in the election. Despite Trump's attacks, Harris's position on fracking may not be as detrimental as it once seemed. Her firm stance during the debate, combined with her messaging on economic stability and climate change, is resonating with voters concerned about job security and the future of clean energy in Pennsylvania. She also held a bus tour through western Pennsylvania, even making a snack stop at a local Sheetz gas station. Geographically, Pennsylvania is conveniently located for both candidates. Trump spends his summers in nearby New Jersey, and Harris lives in Washington, D.C., making Pennsylvania just a short flight away for both campaigns. As David Urban puts it, it's a 20-minute flight, making frequent trips to the state logistically easy. The early voting trends suggest that many Pennsylvanians are already casting their votes based on these issues, and the Democrats' dominance in early voting is a direct reflection of this shift in the electorate. But, as with any election, early voting isn't the final word. Yes, Democrats are dominating early voting in Pennsylvania, but Republicans often make up ground on election day itself. Trump's campaign has banked on this very strategy, hoping that a late surge at the polls could offset Harris' early voting advantage. In 2020, Trump performed well with voters who showed up on election day, and he's hoping for a repeat performance this year. What's critical for both campaigns is turnout. Specifically, which demographic groups will show up in higher numbers on election day? Early voting suggests that Democratic voters, particularly those from urban areas like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, are mobilizing en masse. These areas are heavily Democratic and crucial for Harris. But Trump's support base is still strong in Pennsylvania's rural counties, and it's this electorate that will likely make the difference come election day. Another factor to consider is the enthusiasm gap. Harris has been working hard to inspire voters and avoid the enthusiasm deficit that plagued Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016. Her multiple trips to Pennsylvania, particularly to Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, are designed to keep Democratic voters energized. Meanwhile, Trump's rallies in the state have continued to draw large crowds, maintaining his base's enthusiasm. The question is whether that enthusiasm will translate into enough votes to offset Harris' early voting lead. There's no denying that Pennsylvania is the key to this election. If Harris wins Pennsylvania, her path to the White House becomes much clearer. As mentioned earlier, no Democrat has won the presidency without Pennsylvania since 1948. If the trend holds and Harris secures Pennsylvania along with Michigan and Wisconsin, she is all but guaranteed to win the presidency. But it's not just Harris who needs Pennsylvania. Trump's path to victory also runs through the Keystone State. While he's polling ahead in North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia, he still needs to flip at least one of the blue-wall states to secure the presidency. Pennsylvania is the most likely candidate. That's why we're seeing so much attention on this one state. Both campaigns know that winning here could mean winning at all. The focus on Pennsylvania isn't just about rallies. It's about ad dollars, too. Trump and his allies have reserved over $64 million worth of TV ads in Pennsylvania between September 10th and Election Day. That's more than what they've planned for swing states like Arizona, North Carolina, and Wisconsin combined. Harris's team, however, is outspending Trump. The Harris campaign and its allies have locked in $77 million in ads for Pennsylvania, showcasing just how important the state is to both sides. So, Pennsylvania is more than just a battleground state. It's the battleground state. The early voting trends in favor of the Democrats are promising for Kamala Harris, but nothing is set in stone. As both campaigns make their final push, the outcome in Pennsylvania will likely be decided by a combination of voter turnout, enthusiasm, and how each candidate navigates the key issues like the economy, fracking, and the future of democracy. So, can Kamala Harris win Pennsylvania? Early voting dominance suggests she's on the right track, but the race is far from over. The final decision lies in the hands of Pennsylvanians, who have once again found themselves at the epicenter of a historic election.
