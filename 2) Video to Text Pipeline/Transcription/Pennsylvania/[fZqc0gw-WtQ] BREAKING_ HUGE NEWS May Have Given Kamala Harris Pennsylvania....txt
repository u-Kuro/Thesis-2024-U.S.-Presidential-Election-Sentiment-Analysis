 Alright man, so we got some pretty big news for Kamala Harris here. So as you guys know in the debate There was a surprise name drop and that was actually of Polish people Polish Americans got a pretty surprise name drop They're not really mentioned for much Outside of I think like the sausage or something like that But they don't really get much mention and it's not a voter group that's really talked about very often but they got this big name drop and Kamala Harris is trying to sort of inject that because Polish people really don't like Poland and Polish people really really hate to Russia that puts them in a lot of Weird scenarios because a lot of times like Poland and stuff. They're very like xenophobic Islamophobic You know homophobic etc. So puts them in this weird middle ground where they're like fudge They're kind of more similar to them. They are more similar to them in social policy ideas But they're just very different because they don't want to be like Russia's underling like they were back in the Soviet Union's days. So Here's this article. It says Harris courts Polish American votes in Pennsylvania Polish Americans are an important if politically overlooked demographic, but in Pennsylvania many have tended to lean Republican So keep in mind Pennsylvania is a dog fight. It's gonna be a straight dog fight and who's gonna it's a pure toss-up right now The only state I think that's really a harder dog fight is North Carolina So even the smallest of a little thing can change this result in terms of Pennsylvania It's gonna be so damn close But we're gonna look at this here and see how close it's gonna be in terms of what's going on with this Polish American vote So it says Polish Americans are not an ethnic group that typically gets mentioned in modern American presidential debates So when vice president Kamala Harris noted Pennsylvania's large Polish American population as she discussed the threat that Russia posed to Poland Timothy el kuzma said was pleasantly surprised you start talking about Poland and Polish Americans His ears are gonna perk up said mr Kuzma national president of the Polish Falcons of America a Non-for-nonprofit fraternal benefit organization that provides life insurance for its members and is based in Pittsburgh and the battleground state of Pennsylvania Polish Americans who comprise more than 5% of the population are an important if politically overlooked demographic many of Pennsylvania's roughly 700,000 Polish Americans share a common fear that Vladimir v. Putin has ambitions to restore the former Soviet Union's sphere of influence in Eastern Europe Including Poland so 700,000 Polish Americans in the state and what's interesting enough? Like we just talked about what's going on with the Haitian Americans right now because you know Trump is outwardly sort of antagonizing that group right of people and with spreading lies about you know What's going on with like Haitians in Springfield, Ohio or whatever? They're a group that I think typically goes Democrat. This would be interesting in I don't know if a majority of Polish voters go Republican, but like a good amount of them go Republican So we're kind of with the Haitian vote for the most part you'd be dealing with just boosting turnout Which would boost your numbers here you would potentially be dealing with you know flips right? We could actually flip people who are gonna vote red into voting blue It says but there's less agreement among them on whether Vice President Harris or Donald J Trump would more effectively deal with mr. Putin dr. Barbara Zawadski a retired Pittsburgh physician Whose parents escaped to the United States from communist Poland in 1960 So she feared that mr. Trump would accede to mr. Putin's demands for Ukrainian territory When one looks back at the foreign policy of his first term, he was only interested in Putin's approval dr Zawadski 74 said of mr. Trump that is why he wanted to decrease the importance of NATO He was playing right into Putin's hand so she was going pretty hard also in the debate on like being pro NATO It's kind of like not like a super a position that people are gonna really take a large side on either way I think and sort of be like oh man well that person's pro NATO That's my voter for them like no one's ever gonna say that kind of thing But I think it's an interesting strategy of like hey, you know Donald Trump is somebody who's going to be more sort of Okay with Vladimir Putin being able to expand it So that's gonna end up allowing Poland to you know be more likely to be taken over and so Polish Americans Hey, look out look out, you know, you do want Poland to be taken over. I think it's a pretty interesting strategy She supports miss Harris's plan to continue backing Ukraine's military efforts to repel Russia Even as mr. Trump has suggested that a deal could be brokered to avert more suffering if Ukraine goes to Putin It is the beginning of a domino effect. I think Poland could be the next domino as could be the Baltic countries So we're back at the domino effect, you know the domino effect last time happening in like Indochina During the Cold War looks like we're in the domino effect for like, you know, the Slavic countries or Baltic countries I guess you call them Polish immigrants arrived in Pennsylvania in large numbers in the late 19th century and early 20th century to work in the steel mills and coal mines in places like Pittsburgh and Wilkes-Barre The state also attracted a smaller number of doctors and intellectuals from Poland who came to work in hospitals and universities Another mention as well two other battleground states, Wisconsin and Michigan also have large Polish populations and more genuinely the nation's ethnic Polish population is still I don't know if concentrated is there word you want to use here for a Polish population There's a lot of them in the Northeast and Upper Midwest in Pennsylvania The 2020 presidential race was decided by 80,000 555 votes So Polish voters could prove decisive if they were to line up largely behind mr. Trump or miss Harrison this November's election I'm firstly telling you right now Even like the smallest thing can be really massive in this race because it's gonna be so effing close Especially in a dogfight like Michigan is not a dogfight You know I mean like Arizona is not a dogfight in my opinion Michigan you probably definitely agree with but you know Pennsylvania is about to be a dogfight like anything could foot this effing state, right? so literally anything is super important and I think um Trump strategy is to sort of like alienate as many well not strategies Maybe not doing this on purpose But the Trump campaign keeps alienating more and more groups and so a common strategy appears to be to make a bigger and bigger tent So a bigger tent that she or a bigger group that she's opening up the tent to now is moderate Republicans Another group also, you know, like for example Trump is sort of alienating I guess a lot of JD Vance is doing a lot of it to where he was saying that you know Like grandmother's only role was to raise children and you know, childless women cat ladies or whatever He's they're alienating as many groups as humanly possible. So Kamala Harris is countering with okay, you're gonna send these people away Well, I'm gonna put them in my tent I'm gonna open up my tent and give them room and it'll be an interesting strategy in terms of seeing if it ends up working Out I do think this time around I think there will be like I'm not saying it's gonna be an extreme amount It's gonna be small but there may be some moderate Republican vote that ends up voting for Kamala Harris I think in 2016 is really non-existent in 2020. It actually started up I think Mary Trump kind of helped start that kind of trend now It's a Mary and I think someone else and then you know a bunch of you know There's a senator that came out of cameras to me and you know, there's an Arizona, you know camera froze a mayor or you know, then you have like I think Gonzalez the AG former AG just came out too. There's like a bunch of like these Republicans coming out saying it now Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney and everyone so the strategy is build build build the tent And so this is something that could potentially work But there does appear to be a little bit of a potential caveat with the Polish voters So I'll have to see kind of how this goes Because what it ends up saying here down we look at this So it says while this group may share an affinity for Poland it is far from United politically on issues affecting the United States And many lean quote heavily Republican said Oscar Swan a professor emirates of Slavic languages and literatures at the University of Pittsburgh I think it was a logical and ingratiating thing for Harris to say about Poland and Polish Americans during the debate Professor Swan were in email, but it's wishful thinking on her part if she thinks she's gonna make inroads on this group Mr. Trump in 2021 a majority of votes in eight of the ten Pennsylvania neighborhoods with the highest amount of post residents a time analysis found Though the margins were not large The Reverend Miraslaw Stelmus chick a Catholic priest in Pittsburgh is among the Polish Americans unmoved by miss Harris's call out during the debate He said he was proud when he heard the vice president mentioned his native Poland where his family members who worry about Russian aggression But he plans to vote. Mr. Trump partly because the Republicans plan to clean up the immigration system the United States immigration immigration immigration he said so I Think there seems to be something like I don't know if it's true But I have definitely heard that like generally the Polish sort of diaspora is more like sort of Disconnected from being Polish than others Even if they do identify with being Polish or are sort of with Poland They still will put that aside and kind of look at what's going on in America instead. Also, there's always Unfortunately amongst a lot of immigrant groups like even people whose heritage immigrated here, you know, whatever They'll be anti-immigrant themselves even I think a lot of the Mexicans right now so a very very unfortunate scenario there, but that is kind of the caveat but The only other thing is this does provide you a possibility, right? where it's you know, this quote says you can't put a singular label on Polish American voters is what Kuzma said, but It does give you a possibility of hey Can you flip voters right as opposed to just boosting turnout because with Haitians you probably aren't gonna like flip all that many votes Just because there's probably not that many Republicans but you know with this one you potentially could actually flip people so it'll be interesting and I Don't know if you can make a good meme of it out at this point But like how massive these sort of the Kamala tent is right now is pretty hilarious So it'd be pretty funny to just kind of be able to look at and see like, okay, where exactly? Is this tent gonna stand but Polish Americans, you know, I don't know if any Polish Americans are gonna comment on this post You know, where do you stand on this vote? What is your sort of feeling in terms of your family members or your friends and what's kind of going on also general comments on Like, you know the diaspora stuff. Definitely. Let me know down below Especially if you're in one of these states, it's really impactful like, you know, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, etc but super interesting to see this sort of growth and Genesis of the cup. We'll call it the Kamala tent is what we're gonna we'll call it from here on out the Kamala tent That that's what we'll call it. So as it continues to grow and grow or potentially grow and grow, you know There's a potential right now, you know, we'll potentially have this Kamala tent going
