 Okay, I know how much you love data and looking at things so I'm going to show you a map and that is the county and congressional map of the state of Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania is a swing state in this coming election and I want to show you what's going to happen on election night and that is all of the news stations that people will be watching, even on the internet, they will be getting reports of what the vote counts are for every single county across the country and as we're looking at the election returns coming in throughout the night on election night you start doing the math to anticipate what the outcome is going to be and the math involves what we know about how voters have voted in all the different counties in every single state. We know that certain counties always vote blue so we can estimate how many people will be voting in that election and pretty much do the math across the whole state to calculate who the winner is going to be. So I want to, I'm doing this because Pennsylvania being the swing state and a must-win state for either candidate this time, I want to show you why you're going to have a lot of indigestion throughout the night on election night and why it's always really late in the evening before they can call the state of Pennsylvania and I'll show you why. Okay so this is the state of Pennsylvania and these are all of their counties and congressional districts so what you see with all of these little kind of jaggedy lines and everything these are the boundaries around each of the counties so here's here here here here here here here here and so forth. Now these color areas with the big numbers on them those are the congressional districts so for the purpose of the presidential election here let me show you the whole state maybe I can back out a little bit here. So for the purpose of the presidential election what we're concerned with are the counties okay like this. Now what will happen is throughout the whole night on election night every single one of these counties will be all of them through all state they will be reporting in their election counts from all of the polling stations and all of these counties over here will be the first to report in and so as you're watching whatever station they'll be showing that Pennsylvania is red red red red red and everybody will start freaking out and that's because so many of these counties are reporting in and they're all reporting in huge numbers for Donald Trump but here's what you have to understand about Pennsylvania is that the total vote count in Pennsylvania in 2020 was about 6.9 million total votes cast and 43.2 percent of them came from this county and these counties right here. 10% of the total votes came from just this tiny little area here and that's Philadelphia. Okay so because there are so like 43% of all the votes cast in this entire state are coming from this section and this section that means there are a lot of voters in those areas which means it takes much longer to actually count those votes so it's always late into the evening Allegheny will come in first in Pennsylvania and all of the sudden the numbers in the blue column start shooting up and then when the numbers over in this area come in the numbers will continue to go up. Now these counties here will report in earlier than Philadelphia because there are fewer people here than there are in Philadelphia and the thing to note is of all of these votes here in Allegheny in 2020 almost 65% of them went for Biden in this whole section here including Philadelphia it was about 66% of all the votes from this area went for Biden but in Philadelphia which is included in this number of the 66% but if you take this out and just look at Philadelphia 80% of the votes coming out of Philadelphia went to Biden and so when you look at 43% of all of the votes cast in Pennsylvania are coming from these two areas and that roughly 65% of all of those votes went to Biden it means that the state goes to the Democrat it's just the way that the numbers work out especially if there is a significant increase in the number of people voting in this area especially in Philadelphia and also over here in Allegheny which we expect to have happened in this election so come November when you're watching the election returns you are going to relax take a deep breath get out your popcorn and whatever adult beverages you might be consuming that night and you will just sit and watch the returns coming in from Pennsylvania and you will not care what is happening for the whole state of Pennsylvania until the Philadelphia metropolitan area starts reporting in and Allegheny County because between those two areas that is 40 it's going to be 43% of the vote and in fact I would say with the increase in voter participation for this particular election it could be anywhere from 45 46 48 percent of the entire vote coming out of those two areas and because the majority of the voters are voting for the Democrat this is why I predict Kamala Harris is taking Pennsylvania in this election it's just about the math
