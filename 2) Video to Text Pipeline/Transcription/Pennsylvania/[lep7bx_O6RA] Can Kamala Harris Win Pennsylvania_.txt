Coming to y'all today to do several things While I'm looking for the music We're gonna talk about President Biden Dropping out of the race today, of course, first and foremost We're also gonna talk about his endorsement of Kamala Harris, of course And then we're gonna talk about her prospects for winning This year's national general election Um... Kamala is a Californian first And that can be somewhat of an issue for a national politician at this point Um... There are several things working against Kamala Harris We'll get right to the point The first thing that we wanna discuss is her ethnicity A man wheeled out in Aruba T'Lutha Bryan, who said she's going to win I like the positivity But her ethnicity is a problem, demographically And I'll explain myself, please Don't jump down my grill, just bear with me I say this with no malice But she is a immigrant child Not an ADOS person, not an FDA person Point one, point two She comes from a biracial Jamaican father She comes from a Brahmin Indian family Both of those aspects The woman has about 1 eighth African in her That we know of About 1 eighth So the pretense that this is a black woman in the regards of a traditional African black woman Here in America is not true And they're gonna try to sell her as a black president The same way Obama was sold as a black president, except Obama was half African Again, not a descendant of slaves like some of us But he married into the family Kamala chose to marry Doug, who is a white Jewish man So she already has this exotic background And then she adds to it a white Jewish man Now, I grew up in Pennsylvania And obviously Pennsylvania has a Jewish president, Josh Shapiro So Pennsylvania is not really all that biased against Shapiro or Jewish people in particular But in central Pennsylvania, between Philly and Pittsburgh, where I grew up It might as well be Alabama, Salute to Harrisburg, Harrisburg City as well But it might as well be Alabama, where I grew up And I grew up in what was solid blue democratic territory Looks like the music's a little bit louder, but I'm gonna bring the music down just a little bit Pardon me for a second while I do that But I grew up in that solid blue democratic territory led by Congressman Jack Mirtha Who I watched put on black men from my hometown In the late 70s, as I was a kid, and things were changing in America We started seeing brothers get executive positions in my hometown Salute to Kelly Washington, his family, Vanessa, P, all them But his family was benefited My family was benefited I can honestly say that my father got his job largely because of affirmative action Now, I know how that sounds in 2024 But when you grow up in a town like I did, you had to force white people to have at least one employee on site You had to force them They literally would not hire black people Crump from, so we're talking about Pennsylvania We ain't talking about Alabama, but I'm telling you between Pittsburgh and Philly, it might as well be So that's the environment I grew up in With this movement out of the the civil rights movement And people like my father coming back from Vietnam, they got theirs, right? They got their piece of the American dream in terms of this democratic politician in my hometown Jack Mirtha providing benefits, providing jobs, providing opportunities to black men, etc So that's the basis of the environment, right? Now, it was also an extremely pro-union town Big time pro-union One of the more impressive things in my childhood was my father going on strike When I was about 9 or 10 years old, my little 411 mother took her but to the still mill if you can believe it or not To support our family While my dad struck for three or four months with the electric company and got his money up with the union So these are the basis of my politics I'm a hardcore Democrat Not a Democrat, rather A hardcore leftist liberal politician type of person Here comes politics I left the Democratic Party Depending on what they do, I may rejoin the Democratic Party But those are my roots Conservatism to me means something completely different Understanding where I come from, it is now Trump country It is now completely red After everything I just told you Jack Mirtha, I went to college with his grandson So it's not like the Mirthas weren't in the area They were in the area, right? They've been there Prominent family A guy like Trump's little weasel A little bald head weasel guy, I can't remember his name right now But he is related to a prominent family from my hometown And they absolutely flipped it The poorest city in Pennsylvania With Republican economics and Trumpism So what I'm telling you is that Pennsylvania has been hard flipped It's conservative And a woman with Kamala Harris's background is not going to be able to flip Pennsylvania back And the only thing that Donald Trump needs in order to win the 2024 election out of the six swing states Is Pennsylvania Okay, I'm sounding this alarm because I feel like the guy on the Titanic who saw the iceberg ahead And said, hey, hey iceberg Y'all see that iceberg out there? It's called demographics Y'all see that iceberg? Kamala Harris is too exotic to flip Pennsylvania on her face Also the California problem People hate California And the Republicans are going to say over and over again Turn America into California They're going to turn America into California They're going to turn America into California You're going to hear that so many times Between now and election day If she is the nominee Because she's not yet the nominee But if she is You're going to hear that from now until election day And it is going to be effective Because when people think of California They think of queer folks They think of a lot of stuff that ain't true like violence And California has one of the lowest gun death rates in America California is not wild crime, out of control crime It's not California is very safe Los Angeles with all them gangbangers Is safer than Memphis or Atlanta or even Oakland LA is pretty sick California in general You don't feel threatening anywhere in California That's kind of how it is I'm sure, you know, there's some rougher hoods But I'm here to sing California's praises I have nothing against Kamala Harris or Gavin Newsom In that regard I'm a West Coast liberal But America, my folks back in Pennsylvania Them rednecks They ain't going to turn out for her She's not going to push the white women out in the Philly and Pittsburgh suburbs She's not They will stay loyal to Trump Because they will look at her as competition and not as an ally Think about this as the workplace In the workplace When it comes down to making those executive decisions and hiring the manager There's always a preference Always So to be a black person Or to be somebody who's non-white And to become management or executives or president of the United States You have to surpass the bar By so many miles It's not funny And Kamala just doesn't do it She's not Barack Obama She's not That's my only knock against her I have nothing against the woman personally I think she's a great politician I think she would be a great president But I know this country Especially my home state And so I'm here to warn the Democratic party I'm here to warn the Congressional Black Caucus It's okay to support her There's nothing wrong with supporting her But if you all don't have a fair and open process to test her candidacy If she cannot wrangle the delegates Between now and convention time in five weeks She doesn't deserve to be your nominee She doesn't And why would you hold on to her out of some what? Some sense of loyalty to somebody who couldn't get above 15% in the polls? See the problem is in Washington everybody's looking out for their jobs So everybody in power in the administration other than Joe Biden is still in They're all still fighting for their jobs So that administration is going to leverage all of its executive power To try to prevent anybody else from interrupting Because their jobs are on the line Not just Kamala Harris but everybody in the Biden administration that she might replace Or that anyone might replace Right so Gretchen Whitmer comes along He says no I want my own staff I want my own XYZ of course the cabinet We don't know what would Kamala Harris change Biden's cabinet We don't know Would Gretchen Whitmer with any of them or would they say hey we're going to continue on with this administration regardless of whom you choose to be president I mean if that's the case it's all about identity politics If it's not about agenda what else is it about And the Democrats better come up with an agenda quick Because nobody knows what the hell they're trying to do Nobody knows what they want to do Nobody what you tell me folks what do the Democrats want to do? I know they're lowering student loan debt I'm happy about that it benefits me first My sister got her loans forgiven I was really excited about that thank you Mr. Biden But what did the Democrats have planned for us especially as black folks Besides putting somebody who's one eighth African in the office and claiming that we have a black president again Who's married to a white man a Jewish white man Which is also in the middle of this Palestine Gaza versus Israel conflict Having a Jewish person in the White House with one heartbeat from the presidency or even a spouse I don't think we should criticize it but some are going to look at it as choosing a side And I know Donald Trump has Jewish family so maybe that's a negative but Right now I just want to beat Donald Trump I don't ever want to live under that clown again And I have the fear that should he take office he will never leave office again That's my fear so I've asked I begged and I encourage you all to go pursue an open and honest process for this de facto democratic primary If no one steps up and challenges her Hey, the Democrats have made their bed. They got a lie in it. Let's rock Maybe the VP pick could help her solidify some of those swing states But the problem is pennsylvania And I don't know what camel's deficit looks like in pennsylvania right now but uh We're gonna find out very soon Very very soon and I hope they've well we got time before the convention To lock things down to let polls start to gel To raise Gretchen Whitmer's profile to raise JP Pritzker's profile Anybody else who may want to get in the game some people have said Elizabeth Warren again Too old. I don't want nobody over 70 running. Nobody over 70. The gas is home enough Garretocracy go home go home Enough Not only are you old you're wealthy. What the hell do you need to be working for go home? The rest of us can't wait to retire can't wait But they're so addicted to money and power that they cling to it like they're guns and their bombers Joe Biden tried to die in office. Yo That man might die within the next six months. We all see what's going on. He tried to die in office They have no shame Let's get them through this election Let's get rid of this trump era once and for all the right way Not by assassins bullets, but let's get rid of trump the right way And then we get that progressive movement pushing harder and harder Okay But the line that i'm pushing for y'all Is Gretchen Whitmer governor of michigan who will instantly take michigan? Who will drive out the white women in pennsylvania? In this philly in pennsylvania and philly suburbs pittsburgh suburbs. She will drive them out She will drive out the white women in ohio. She will drive out the white women in wisconsin She will win And I want y'all to go on twitter after this live and search gretchen whitmer And watch how the republicans are attacking her as we speak because they are deathly afraid of this woman They're so afraid of this woman. They tried to kidnap her Okay She's a good-looking woman None of us are gonna mind looking at her for eight years at all. She's smart She's effective She's white And unfortunately, we ain't got time to play race card games with the fucking cbc part of my language But we ain't got time We don't cbc is ridiculous All this cape and you know why because She's one eighth black, but she's Flubby you know what? This is the aim crowd trying to make sure they stay the aim crowd I say it's time to upset the apple cart. We're still choosing establishment candidates. Nobody's trying to have a revolution under your noses But when damn it And this is your man zen master for zen master sports and shorts so in the game game And we'll see you on the next go round Peace Forget the middle weeks Yeah Yo Tune in we're about to get it cracking on gutter cash real stories from the darkest corners Straight from the hoods with crops a daily order Yo, welcome to gutter cash.
