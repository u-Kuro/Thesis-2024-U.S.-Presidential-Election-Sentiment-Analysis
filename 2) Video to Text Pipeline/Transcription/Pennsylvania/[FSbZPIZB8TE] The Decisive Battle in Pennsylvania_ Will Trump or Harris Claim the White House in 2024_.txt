 I know where the United States belongs. The administration is a new generation. Greetings to the audience. We are arriving at one of the hottest spots in the race for the White House in 2024. Pennsylvania, the decisive battleground state, is where both leading candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, are intensifying their campaigns with different strategies and policies. The race here not only reflects fierce competition, but also portrays the overall political landscape of the United States. Join us as we analyze and update the latest information on this race. First, it can be said that Pennsylvania is considered an indispensable battleground state in U.S. presidential elections due to its swing voter nature. The state leaned towards the Republicans under Donald Trump in 2016. But in 2020, Joe Biden regained victory through strong campaigning in urban and suburban areas. This highlights the complexity of Pennsylvania's electorate, a state with a large and diverse population in terms of ethnicity, economic class and age. In the 2024 race, Pennsylvania once again becomes the focus of campaigns, as both sides understand that winning this state will have a significant impact on the final result. The diversity of this state is a major factor, making it the focal point of election campaigns. Unlike other states with stable support for one particular party, Pennsylvania contains both Democratic-leaning urban areas and Republican-leaning rural areas. This creates a fierce competition between the candidates as they seek support from both of these voter groups. In fact, there are seven key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada. All play crucial roles in determining the victory of any candidate. However, Pennsylvania stands out, with top strategists from both the Harris and Trump campaigns viewing it as the state most likely to swing the election. Both candidates have poured more money, time and effort into Pennsylvania than anywhere else. The amount of television ad spending by Democrats and Republicans in Pennsylvania reached $350 million, $142 million more than the second-ranking state, Michigan. There are three reasons why both candidates are focusing on Pennsylvania. First, the size of the state. Its 19 electoral votes are the largest prize among battleground states. Second, polls show the two candidates are evenly matched in the state for several months. Third, mathematically, it would be very difficult for either Trump or Harris to reach the necessary 270 electoral votes without winning Pennsylvania. Two voters and voter group analysis. What makes Pennsylvania a fierce battleground for both parties is the remarkable combination of demographic and geographic factors in this state. Pennsylvania is particularly divided between different voter groups in different regions. Urban voters. Large cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are Democratic strongholds. These areas have diverse populations, particularly black communities, immigrants and young voters who tend to lean towards progressive policies. Issues like racial equality, health care and education are often key concerns for this group. Kamala Harris as a woman of color and the first female vice president has an advantage in attracting voters in these areas. Suburban voters. Suburban voters in Pennsylvania became a key group in the 2020 election when many shifted from supporting Trump to backing Joe Biden. In 2024, both candidates place high hopes on this group who are concerned with issues like the economy, jobs and public health. For Harris, economic policies supporting the middle class and public health care programs continue to be highlights to attract suburban voters. Rural voters. Pennsylvania also includes many rural areas and traditional industrial zones where voters lean towards the Republican Party and Donald Trump. Industries like coal mining, steel production and agriculture remain important in the local economy and policies protecting local jobs from the impacts of globalization are core factors in attracting the support of this group. Three candidate strategies. The election campaign in Pennsylvania is intense. Harris' team is running online ads targeting voters in Hispanic-heavy areas of eastern Pennsylvania and ads featuring Republican members who have voted for her on over 130 rural radio stations. According to a member of Trump's campaign, the former president has sent his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, Ohio, to more stops in Pennsylvania than anywhere else. This state is also where Trump held an exclusive meeting with Sean Hannity on Fox News. On October 2nd, Trump returned to Pennsylvania to hold two rallies in Scranton and Reading. These were his eighth and ninth rallies in the state since Harris entered the race. While former First Lady Melania Trump has yet to appear at any campaign rallies, Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, recently had a beer while watching a football game in suburban Philadelphia and spoke at a voter registration concert in Pittsburgh. Both sides are trying to court key activists and officials in Pennsylvania. It's no coincidence that at both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, delegates from Pennsylvania were seated in prime spots just behind delegates from the candidates' home states. Pennsylvania is the center of the universe, said Cliff Maloney, who leads efforts to get Republican voters to vote by mail in the state. Lt. Gov. Austin Davis, when he last met with Harris, jokingly told her she should rent an apartment in the state. The vice president just laughed, but in fact, in September, Harris visited Pennsylvania once every three days, a remarkable frequency for a battleground state. Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party's strategy. Kamala Harris, as the leading Democratic candidate, is employing a strategy of maintaining strong support in urban areas while trying to expand her influence in suburban regions. For Harris, key issues include health care reform, tackling climate change, and creating green jobs. Her campaigns in Pennsylvania focus on policies that aim to improve the lives of residents, particularly in the post-COVID-19 context. However, Harris faces challenges in rural and traditional industrial areas, where her green energy policies may raise concerns about job losses. To counter this, her strategy emphasizes that green policies will create new jobs in various sectors, from clean energy to high-tech manufacturing. Therefore, when Democratic candidate Kamala Harris promotes her economic agenda, she heads to Pittsburgh, the industrial heart of Pennsylvania. When announcing her running mate, she went to Philadelphia. And when choosing the venue for her first rally featuring former President Barack Obama on October 10th, she once again returned to Pittsburgh. All of these locations are in Pennsylvania. Donald Trump and the Republican Party's strategy. Donald Trump, who won Pennsylvania in 2016, still enjoys strong support from rural and working-class voters in the state. Trump focuses on protecting jobs in traditional industries such as coal and steel, while criticizing Democratic clean energy policies as threats to the local economy. Trump has allocated the majority of his advertising budget to Pennsylvania and has held more rallies in this battleground state than any other since Harris officially entered the race for the White House. Trump continues to emphasize issues related to immigration, border security, and opposing the expansion of social programs, which he argues contribute to the rising national debt. By focusing on these issues, Trump hopes to strengthen support from rural voters and attract more middle-class suburban voters. For international and national factors affecting Pennsylvania, beyond domestic issues, international events also impact voters in Pennsylvania. For example, the war in Ukraine, tensions with China, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic all play roles in shaping voter perspectives. The Ukraine war, the conflict in Ukraine and U.S. involvement in supporting the country, have become key foreign policy issues. While many urban voters support maintaining strong international relations and defending Democratic values globally, rural voters may be more concerned with America focusing on domestic issues. Tensions with China, Pennsylvania is a state with a large manufacturing industry, and trade wars with China have directly impacted the state's economy. Trump has an advantage in using a tough stance on China to shore up support from working-class voters in manufacturing sectors, while Harris must try to strike a more cautious approach to balance economic and diplomatic interests. Five predictions and analysis of potential outcomes. The race in Pennsylvania remains highly uncertain, and both candidates understand that every vote counts. The campaign in the coming months is expected to continue intensifying with more resources and time invested in this state. What is clear is that Pennsylvania will continue to play a crucial role in determining the ultimate winner of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
