 The race is a dead heat in the state of Pennsylvania according to pretty much all of the polling including the latest from CBS You gov so much attention is being paid to the state because it was because of its 19 Electoral votes and how crucial they are in fact no Democrats since 1948 has won the White House without winning, Pennsylvania Joining us now Democratic senator from Pennsylvania John Fetterman senator. Thank you very much for joining us Oh, hey, it's just great to be here. What is the key to winning, Pennsylvania? specifically what's Western, Pennsylvania Well, I think really it's I you know back in 2016 I dressed like a slob and I didn't have any hair and I've been saying this is gonna be really close It's gonna be incredibly close when it was the secretary Clinton and here we are in 2024 and I still dress like a slob I don't have any hair and it's gonna be very close right now too because it's a very stark choice here and there and And now I do believe Kamala Harris is going to prevail on that but we must we can't forget that Trump has an appeal in Pennsylvania and we need to make sure we show up everywhere and we need to come at them and Make the argument and a lot of the kinds of rooms that other times people aren't even going to showing up and that's what I've been Doing and that's what I'm going to be doing between now until the election right now And but people understand who Trump is and I don't know why some people might have that kind of appeal But after everything that we've done and what has happened whether it's the trail or whether it's the impeachment or whether it's what to do impeachment or January 6 or even after the assassination attempt all of those kinds of things I'm not really convinced that this debate's gonna change and then a significant kinds of way Well, I wonder I wonder if there is a way to change it you say people know who Donald Trump is. That's true There are still folks who say they need to know more about Kamala Harris They know a whole lot about President Biden and not not a lot of people like President Biden and the policies Should Kamala Harris separate herself more clearly from President Biden I Think in everything that the way she's lived her life and during her career throughout all of that She's distinguished herself very clearly from from Trump on this and that's that's where I'm at. It's it's really it's about the choice It's not about the money or it's about policies or those kinds of obscure things It's it's about the choice and what kind of a direction do we want our nation to go in and after all those things? And and that's really going to be much of a kind of a gut-check kind of a thing and and I was very concerned in 2016 and unfortunately that's what happened and in 2020 Joe Biden leaned in and then the kinds of things that were needed to win Pennsylvania and he did that but it was still very close and I don't think there's going to be a runaway in Pennsylvania It's going to be very close And now I do fundamentally believe the majority of Pennsylvanians are going to say look I am NOT ever ever ever going to go back to those kinds of Chaotic and unhinged kind of a days that we had now and and I do fundamentally believe that this debate again I happen to know that The vice president is going to have amazing kinds of preparation right now I had I had the same kinds of people like Karen Dunn. She's amazing She helped me in for my own debate and she's going to be absolutely prepared for that And she's going to be prepared for anything But I do fundamentally believe that she's going to go great Trump is going to be strange and he's going to say a lot about landish things But at the end of the day I think the debate is kind of we're going to move on past that and we're going to return to a very very close race in Pennsylvania and across across the nation and a lot of the a lot of the Critical states what should VP Kamala Harris in your opinion talk about in the state of Pennsylvania to win that state? I'm not here to give her any kinds of Opinions again. It's like she's absolutely capable to to have that message But what I'm committed to doing is I'm going to keep showing up and letting people understand that it's like hey You know I I stand with with the vice president just like I stood with with Joe Biden throughout all of this and I believe that Kamala Harris is going to prevail on this I really want people to understand I don't have anything different to say between now and 2016 that We all have to understand that it's going to be incredibly close and all of the things that's happened and all the Scandals and everything that hasn't that hasn't have any impact on Trump and here's where we are And now let's just hold hold the line between now and November And it's going to be very close and I do believe we are going to prevail in all of these things is it a pro-democracy Message freedom message is it an economic message that will win, Pennsylvania I know you don't want to give her advice, but you know the state well. You know Western, Pennsylvania I'd love to hear what you think should be focused on I Think that's a very stark choice, and I think all of those things are embedded in that you know if you really if democracy is Important to you of course you know you know vice president Harris is going to be who you choice if you're talking about reproductive freedom for women of course obviously you're going to you're going to choose the vice president and if you're concerned about is somebody going to try to have an insurrection and and and Claim about you know rigged elections and things so definitely you're going to vote for for Harrison things But but that's why I can't understand why I personally would vote for that But I know a lot of people that are in an absolutely going to vote for Donald Trump and spend any time all across in small County, Pennsylvania You see a lot of support and there's a lot of energy there for Trump And I want people to understand that it's it's true And it's there and if we don't take it very seriously Then we do it our own peril on that the same message that I would have had Back the secretary Clinton, and I would like to remind the secretary Clinton She beat Trump in all three debates I was actually in the audience of that first debate and he absolutely Wooked him, but that really wasn't determinative in that race sadly Yeah, and so I want everybody to do on this I do believe that Harris is going to win and Trump is going to have a strong performance, too But I do not think it's going to change the underlying dynamic that I've already been discussing That it's since 2016 a senator John Federman. Thank you very much I didn't have time to get to it But the Biden administration today announced it would be finalizing proposal to force health insurance companies to cover Mental health care the same way they cover physical health conditions. I know you're a fan of that a proponent of it Next time you come on we'll get into that a little bit more. Thank you for joining us Thank you, thank you, that's really that's actually true you really can't you can't split physical health and Mental health so it's thank you. I totally agree. They are both Conditions that should be treated You
