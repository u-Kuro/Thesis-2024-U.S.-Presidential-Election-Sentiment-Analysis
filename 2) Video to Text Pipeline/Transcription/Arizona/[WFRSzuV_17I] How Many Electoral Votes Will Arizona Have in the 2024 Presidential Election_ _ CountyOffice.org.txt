 Welcome to County Office, your ultimate guide to local government services and public records. Let's get started. How many electoral votes will Arizona have in the 2024 presidential election? To determine the number of electoral votes Arizona will have in the 2024 presidential election, we need to look at the state's representation in the electoral college. The electoral college system allocates electoral votes to each state based on its number of members in the House of Representatives, plus its number of senators. Arizona, like all states, has two senators. In addition, Arizona has a specific number of representatives in the House, which is determined by its population relative to other states. Following the 2020 United States Census, the number of representatives for each state was adjusted. However, Arizona did not gain or lose any seats in this reapportionment. This means Arizona still has the same number of congressional representatives it had prior to the census. Specifically, Arizona has nine members in the House of Representatives and two senators. When you combine these numbers, you get the total number of electoral votes. So let's do the math. Nine representatives plus two senators equals 11 electoral votes. This number has been consistent since the last census and will remain so for the 2024 presidential election. In summary, Arizona's 11 electoral votes are a crucial factor in the national election, given the state's status as a swing state and its historical influence on presidential outcomes.
