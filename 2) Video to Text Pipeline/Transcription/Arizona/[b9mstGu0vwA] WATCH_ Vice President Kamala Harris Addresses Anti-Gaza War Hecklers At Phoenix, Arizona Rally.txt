 I will focus on health care because this is where I come from. I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the... Hey guys, you know what? Here's the thing. Let's talk for a moment about Gaza. We all want this war to end and get the hostages out. And I will work on it full time when I am elected president as I've been. And I have yours. So there's a contrast in this election on so many issues. Including our plans for America's economy. Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time. Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest corporations and this time he will pay for it. And this time his plan is a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Clothes, food, toys, cell phones. A Trump sales tax according to the economist would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year. And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Also known as Obamacare and he has a powerful friend in Congress, the Speaker of the House, who recently said if Trump wins, there will be quote, no Obamacare. Which would throw, understand the meaning of that. It would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance and take us back to the time which we remember. When insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions, well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We're not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back.
