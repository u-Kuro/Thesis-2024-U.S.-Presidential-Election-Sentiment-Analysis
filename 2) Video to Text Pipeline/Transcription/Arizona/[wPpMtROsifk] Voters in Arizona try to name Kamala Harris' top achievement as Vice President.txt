 As vice president, I really don't, I know that she was sent to the border, but, and from what I hear in the news and stuff, she didn't accomplish much with that, but I don't know of many vice presidents that, at least, they probably do accomplish some things, but I never hear of it. Actually, I couldn't even tell you what the biggest accomplishment is for her. I don't really pay attention to the news that much. It's really difficult to say beyond her just being there what her biggest accomplishment is. For me, personally, Palestine continues to be something that's heavy on my mind, and my rights as a woman in Arizona continue to be heavy on my mind, so it's not so much about her accomplishments and more about what she can do to ensure that my child, who's 14 years old, is going to have the same rights that I had that were recently taken away from me. Unfortunately, I think she's been too much in the background of a vice president and not too much involved with President Biden. I think she should have stepped up a few notches, stepped it up a few notches to be more involved as vice president, so I think that will kind of hurt her in this election.
