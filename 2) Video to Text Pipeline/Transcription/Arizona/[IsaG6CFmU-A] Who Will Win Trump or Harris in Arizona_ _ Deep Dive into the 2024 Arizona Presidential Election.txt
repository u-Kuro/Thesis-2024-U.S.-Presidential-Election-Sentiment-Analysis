 Hello everyone and welcome to today's video. Today I'm doing a deep dive into the 2024 presidential election. Today's video is on the state of Arizona, an absolutely critical swing state in this election very important to both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris' pathway to victory. Looking at the presidential voting history in the state of Arizona, in 2020 Arizona was won by President Joe Biden by just 0.3% of the vote. Incredibly incredibly close. I believe the second closest state in the entire country just behind the state of Georgia in 2020 in terms of margin of victory. In 2016 the state of Arizona was won by Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by 3.5% of the vote. And in 2012 Arizona was won by Mitt Romney over Barack Obama by 9.1% of the vote. Right now in the current RCP polling average, Donald Trump holds a lead over Kamala Harris in the state of Arizona but a very very close lead of 48.1% of the vote to 47.6% of the vote. About 3-4% of the vote still remaining could be either undecided or third party at this time. So still a lot of outstanding vote for both Trump and Harris to gain in the state of Arizona in incredibly incredibly close polling numbers right now. In the national popular vote of the last three elections, in 2020 Biden won the popular vote by 4.4%, 2016 Hillary Clinton won it by 2.1% and in 2012 Barack Obama won it by 3.9%. As of the day I'm recording this video, the 2024 head to head national vote polling average has Harris over Trump by 1.8% which looking at the past three elections that would be the lowest popular vote win for a Democrat out of any of the last three elections which could certainly spell some potential trouble for Harris's chances of winning the election because you would think, well Harris is winning the popular vote, she'll get more votes nationwide, doesn't that mean she would win the election and the way the electoral college system works is it actually does not. And I'll show you what I mean by this right now. In 2020 the state of Arizona voted 4.1% to the right of the popular vote. So even though Joe Biden won the state of Arizona, Arizona still voted 4.1% to the right of the popular vote. If Harris only wins the popular vote by 1.8% this time and Arizona once again votes 4.1% to the right of the popular vote, that would give Trump enough to win the state by a little over 2% of the vote. Let's say Trump only wins, or Arizona excuse me, only votes 2% to the right of the popular vote. Well Trump would then win the state by 0.2% if the numbers remained the same. So this is why it's very very important that for Harris's chances of winning she needs to have a higher popular vote margin than what Hillary Clinton got in 2016 where she lost the election very very narrowly because of Republicans because of Trump outperforming the national vote in several states percentage wise. So what I'm saying is for a state like Arizona if the popular vote is only 1.8% lead for Harris while the popular vote does not elect the president it may be a sign that Harris is not faring too well in a lot of the battleground states which are expected to vote more Republican or more Democrat depending than the popular vote it depends on the state. So in 2020 as I mentioned Arizona voted 4.1% more Republican than the national vote. In 2016 Arizona voted 5.6% more Republican than the national vote. In 2012 Arizona voted 13% more Republican than the national vote an average difference of 7.6% across the last three elections. The only good news for Democrats on this though is if you notice across the last three elections that number is getting smaller. It went from 13 in 2012 down to 4.1 in 2020 and it's certainly possible that 4.1 in 2024 is even smaller. The only problem is from 2016 to 2020 yes Biden was able to flip the state from red to blue in 2020 it went down one and a half percentage points. If Arizona goes down one and a half percentage points again from 2020 to 2024 well then that would put it about 2.5% that would still be enough for Trump to win if Harris's popular vote stays around 1.8% which is why I'm trying to push the point that Harris at 1.8% lead in the national vote I don't think would be enough to win a state like Arizona that's why I'm pushing that point very heavily. As for the presidential forecast in the state of Arizona no surprise Arizona is one of the top toss up states across the country. Popular politics has it as a toss up, Sabot crystal ball does as well, Inside elections does as well, Decision Desk HQ slash The Hill they have it as a toss up, Cook Political Report also has a toss up and you can also check all the major news networks in America you know CBS, CNN, ABC, Fox News all of them all of them will have Arizona as a toss up state very very close in this election. Some key counties I'm watching in the state of Arizona it all begins and ends with Maricopa County this is a county that was reliable Republican in 2012 and even before that in 2016 Trump won it by 2.8% he won statewide by a little under 4% of the vote in 2020 Joe Biden wins this county by 2.2% and Biden wins this state by just 0.3% of the vote. If Trump is going to win the state of Arizona he either needs to do way better everywhere else like drastically better and keep Maricopa County at 2.2 or Trump needs to get this number at 2.2% slightly smaller than what it is. Trump can win the state of Arizona without winning Maricopa County but if Harris expands on Biden's 2.2% in Maricopa County and everything else throughout the state of Arizona remains equal I'm having a hard time finding a way for Trump to get enough votes to win the state of Arizona. So Trump's number one target has to be Maricopa County in Arizona. Harris's number one target has to be defending Maricopa County and trying to grow on what Biden was able to do in 2020. How it's looking right now is anyone's guess we're gonna have to wait till election day to find out but Maricopa County if there's only one county in Arizona I'm watching it is 100% Maricopa County the election I think will be won and be lost in this one county and this is why on election day I think Arizona will take a long time to decide who will win because we're gonna be waiting on the final votes out of Maricopa County like in 2020 and even though it wasn't as close in 2016 that was also a similar situation we're likely gonna be waiting on votes out of Maricopa late into the evening. Another county I'm watching is Yuma County not as big population as Maricopa it was 12.6 in 2012 for Romney 1.1 for Trump in 2016 6.2 for Trump in 2020 I'm interested in the margins here because for Trump if Trump is not able to improve in Maricopa he needs to do better in a county like Yuma where he did go up five points from 16 to 20 up to 6.2 but if Trump is not doing better in Maricopa this 6.2 needs to become like plus 10 or plus 9 to make up enough votes to try and counterbalance Maricopa so Yuma is what I'm watching for for the margins I know it'll go for Trump I'm watching for the margins on that one. Pima County is a county that's expected to vote Democrat but I'm very interested to see what the margins is in this county it was 6.9 in 2012 13.6 in 2016 and 18.7 in 2020 it goes up about seven points from 12 to 16 five points from 16 to 20 is there going to be a jump from 2020 to 2024 and how much that is what I'm interested in watching as well. Navajo County the final county I'm looking at 7.9 for Romney in 2012 10.2 for Trump in 2016 8.3 for Trump in 2020 again another smaller county we fully expect to go for Donald Trump but what is the percentage margin of victory in that county where again if Maricopa is staying the same or only budging a bit you have to look at a county like this and say okay can Trump make up the votes in a county like Navajo and by how much this is one I'm very much closely watching. Now looking at Arizona county map statewide in 2020 Biden got 49.4% of the vote Trump got 49.1% again very very close Maricopa County narrowly flipped flipped blue at 50.3 to 48.1 super super close can't underscore this enough 2024 this is the county I'm watching for every single second that I'm watching on Arizona I'm watching Maricopa County Yuma County right down here 52.3 for Trump 46.1 for Biden Navajo County right here 53.4 to 45.2 Pima County 58.6 to 39.9 this is one I am watching as well for Harris. 2016 Trump wins the state of Arizona excuse me 48.7 45.1 and look Maricopa County goes red 47.7 44.3 a three point margin of victory in Maricopa and about a 3.6 margin of victory in the state of Arizona again I think Maricopa County goes may very well be how the state of Arizona goes Yuma 47.5 46.4 Navajo 51.1 40.9 and Pima finally 53.3 39.7 looking at 2012 Obama Romney this is a much bigger and by gone era honestly in Arizona where it's a nine point win for Romney over Obama 53.7 44.6 Maricopa was over 10 points in 2012 win for Romney Yuma 55.7 43.1 for Obama 53.3 to 45.4 and 52.7 45.7 I mean as much as I'm sure Trump would love to see a 2012 Obama Romney map 2020 is certain I think somewhere between 2020 and 2016 is what we're mostly looking at I wouldn't be shocked if every county stays the exact same from 2020 and 2024 but Maricopa County a hundred percent is the county I'm watching for does it stay blue and if it does what's the percentage does it flip red and what is the percentage that is what's going to decide how the state of Arizona goes on election night now looking at the party percentages for both Republicans and Democrats in 2020 Trump got 49.1% the vote lost a very close election 2016 Trump got 48.7% of the vote won a very close election in 2012 Romney got 53.7% and won the state when you look at 2024 the estimated range based on these numbers of the highest minus the lowest and taking the range of that added to the highest and lowest numbers a low point of Arizona Republicans at 43.7 a high of 58.7 and the average vote across the last three elections a 50.5% a range this close from 43.7 58.7 certainly shows that it is a very winnable race on both the Republican side and you're about to see on the Democratic side easily Republicans can win or lose Arizona depending on how the night goes very very close on the Democratic side very similar 2020 Biden got 49.4 2016 45.1 for Clinton and 2012 44.6 for Obama a low end of 39.8 on the range to a high of 54.2 kind of similar numbers for the Republicans very very winnable for both Republicans and Democrats in Arizona an average vote across last three elections of 46.4 so when you're looking at it the average vote across the last three elections does favor the Republicans the most recent election 2020 of Trump vs Biden when you look at just that one alone you would think okay that favors the Democrats then the estimated range very very narrowly favors the Republicans even though it's pretty much the same when you look at what the numbers are the Democrats are slightly lower Republicans are slightly higher but it's not by a huge margin it's very very close in that respect so you have to look at the polling data and that's super close only half of 1% of the vote separating Harrison Trump in the average Arizona is going to be very very close on election night and it's a state that can really go either way but in my prediction for the state of Arizona I have Donald Trump outperforming the polls slightly in the state and winning by 2% of the vote statewide this is one where I think the polls will just be a little bit off on election day in Arizona not by a huge margin only about 1.5% of the vote I think they'll be off by which is not a huge number when you look at polls considering the variance of maybe a hidden Trump vote that we saw in 2016 and 2020 I do have Trump winning the state of Arizona but not in a blowout not like a 2012 Obama Romney and not even as big of a win as 16 Trump vs Clinton I think the in between numbers of 2020 and 2016 somewhere in between that is where Trump and Harris end up and I think Trump wins the state of Arizona but given how close this election is if Harris won the state I won't lie I would not be totally shocked I do think Trump is favored to win the state right now that's why I'm making this prediction but it's gonna be a very very close state on election night and right now on the 2024 electoral map Kamala Harris is 81 electoral votes Donald Trump is up to 37 Harris started out with a big lead when I started with Washington Oregon California and Hawaii Trump has Alaska Idaho Montana Wyoming Utah Nevada and Arizona Trump was slowly starting to inch his way back up to Harris is 81 electoral votes and catch up however depending on which state comes next in the deep dive series maybe Trump's trend continues maybe it doesn't maybe Harris picks up some more electoral votes you'll have to tune in
