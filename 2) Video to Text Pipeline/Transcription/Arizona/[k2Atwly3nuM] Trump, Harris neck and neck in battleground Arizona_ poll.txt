 Well you guys, we continue to follow politics closely. There's some new polling data out just this morning with some key election issues for voters in our state. Here's what Marist has found in its poll. There's so many different organizations honing in on Arizona. Our state is crucial. They found 1,500 of likely voters, and it finds that Donald Trump leads here in our state. But by a much slimmer margin than that previous poll from the New York Times a couple of days ago, they had said five points. This Marist poll says it's a one point lead. Harris does lead in independence by a four point margin, but that's less than half of what President Biden had over Trump in 2020. Marist also at the same time releasing data for Georgia, where it shows as tight Trump with a one point lead, and North Carolina where the two candidates are tied. In the race for the US Senate, the Democrat Ruben Gallego has a 10 point lead in this poll over the Republican Kerry Lake, 54 to 44, independents heavily favoring Gallego, 64%. When it comes to the top issues in Arizona, very interesting, this survey says that preserving democracy is the number one issue, and inflation is behind that at 26%, then immigration, and then abortion, finishing third and fourth. Election integrity always a talking point. In Arizona, about two thirds of likely voters say they are confident that the state will run a fair and accurate election.
