 Probably inflation for most people. Economy. It seems like homelessness is quite the problem. Democracy is the most important thing. Buying groceries, literally. I'm at the grocery store every day because I'm pinching, trying to figure out like, hey, do I need this? Can I buy this? Can I afford this? Is everything just skyrocketing? Don't have the same spending money. Rent, food, gas. Because that affects your daily living, you know, I mean, with the prices at the store and the gas pumps. The Republicans, just because as a party, they are fiscally more responsible. Kamala, kamala, kamala, kamala. Because I believe, again, the rich have been riding a wave of tax cuts and not responsibility. I would say Trump, for sure. I think Trump is better. The last time he was in, I thought the economy was a lot better. Gas prices were lower. I think, I just, the overall was cheaper. I think we're doing better economy wise with him. I strongly hope Harris. A lot of people are like, I don't know, you know, they don't know what to do. But they'll make up their mind. And I think they'll do the right thing.
