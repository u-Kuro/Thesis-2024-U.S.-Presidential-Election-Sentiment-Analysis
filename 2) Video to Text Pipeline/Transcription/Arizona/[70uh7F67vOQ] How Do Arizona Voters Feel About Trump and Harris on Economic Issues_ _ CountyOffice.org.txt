 Welcome to County Office, your ultimate guide to local government services and public records. Let's get started. How do Arizona voters feel about Trump and Harris on economic issues? In Arizona, the economic landscape is a critical factor in the 2024 presidential election, with voters expressing distinct preferences when it comes to Trump and Harris. When it comes to managing the economy, Arizona voters trust Trump more than Harris. According to recent CNN polls, Trump leads Harris by an 11-point margin on economic issues. Foreign policy is another area where Trump is seen as more trustworthy, with a 7-point lead over Harris in Arizona. The national debt and federal deficit are significant concerns for many voters. Both candidates' economic proposals are projected to increase the national debt. But Trump's plan would add almost $8 trillion by 2035, compared to Harris' plan, which would add almost $4 trillion. Inflation is a key economic issue, and voters' perceptions vary. While Trump is seen as more capable of handling inflation by some, others note that the rate of change in consumer prices has moderated significantly since mid-2022, which could sway support towards Harris. Taxes are also a pivotal issue, with both candidates proposing various tax cuts and credits. Trump has offered a broader range of tax cuts, including reducing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, while Harris' proposals are more focused on specific groups. Among crucial demographics, women in Arizona favor Harris on economic issues with a 16-point margin, while men prefer Trump by a 14-point margin. Independent voters in Arizona are almost evenly split, with 45 percent favoring Trump and 43 percent supporting Harris, indicating a slight increase in support for Harris since August. When evaluating the candidates' issue positions versus their leadership qualities, slightly over half of Arizona voters prioritize issue stances, while Harris supporters tend to emphasize leadership traits more. Overall, Arizona voters' opinions on economic issues are closely contested, reflecting broader national trends and highlighting the importance of economic management in their voting decisions.
