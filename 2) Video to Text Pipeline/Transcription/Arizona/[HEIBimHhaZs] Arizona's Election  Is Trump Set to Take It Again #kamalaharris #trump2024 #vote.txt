 An hour left with the four most competitive states where voting will end at 9pm, we're going to begin down in Arizona, worth 11 electoral votes. Trump is currently on track to win. There's no doubt about that. He's taken a pretty commanding lead in the state. In fact, out of all seven of the swing states, none of them currently lean more to the right than Arizona. Trump leads by 1% in the most recent poll. But besides the two morning console polls, which again heavily lean towards the left, every other poll has shown Trump ahead, with one of them showing a tie. And so currently, the state of Arizona is going to be tilled red based on the most recent poll, but Trump is performing a lot better than he was in 2020 when he lost the state entirely to Joe Biden. Coming up now.
