 Welcome back, Truthseeker. Take a good look at CNN's front page. Harrison Trump locked in close races in Arizona and Nevada. Hmm, interesting. Kamala in Arizona leads with 48%, whereas Trump has 47. Hmm, interesting numbers. Arizona's the 48th state in order of statehood, as we know in Jamatria. President equals 47, like White House, like government, like authority, like Republican, like Democrat, like Trump. And then in Nevada, which also equals 47, Kamala has 47, and Trump has 48. I mean, come on. Donald Trump also has 48. And remember, there is a narrative for one to become the 47th president and the other to become the 48th if Biden doesn't finish his term. Hmm, and poor Terry Gar of Young Frankenstein dead at 79 right before Halloween. Of course, murder equates to 79 in Jamatria. And as song goes, murder by numbers, it's the sport of the elected, politics in full focus. And then the burning ballots with the fireworks, you guys. Again, this happened in Portland, Oregon, in Vancouver, Washington, two cities separated by the Columbia River, like how the federal cities in the other Washington, in the District of Columbia, aka the District of Criminals, but people aren't getting the joke. The elections on Remember, Remember the 5th of November when the Jesuits tried to blow up British Parliament with fireworks. I mean, come on. Come on. The wrestler in the pulpit. Oh my God, man. This nation is one big joke. Till next time, Truesicle.
