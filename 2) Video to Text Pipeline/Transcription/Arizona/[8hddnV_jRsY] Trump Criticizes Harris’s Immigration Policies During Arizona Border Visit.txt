 On the day Vice President Kamala Harris gave her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, former President Donald Trump focused on immigration, a topic he frequently criticizes Harris for. Trump visited the U.S.-Mexico border in southern Arizona and used the opportunity to attack Harris and her immigration policies, accusing her of ignoring violent crimes committed by migrants. He criticized her role as border czar, a label Republicans use, despite the role technically belonging to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. Trump's remarks were part of his broader campaign strategy to highlight immigration and border security issues, reflecting his previous promise to complete the border wall. His rhetoric continues to include strong anti-immigrant sentiments, though studies show that U.S. citizens are more likely to commit crimes than unauthorized immigrants.
