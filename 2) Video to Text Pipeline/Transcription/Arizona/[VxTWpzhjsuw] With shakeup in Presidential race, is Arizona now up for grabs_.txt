 KTA our news on air online on the KTA our news app obviously you are focused and how the turmoil in the presidential race is affecting Arizona the rest of the country actually cares an awful lot about what we think too because we're one of those states in play this time around just like we were in 2020. Our guest right now Chuck Coughlin president and CEO of high ground public affairs consultants. Chuck now that we've seen a shake up at the top of the ticket on the Democratic side is Arizona in play. Oh yeah yeah I never thought it was really out of play okay you know I think 80% of Americans didn't want to see the contest that it was unfolding I think the president's announcement on Sunday changes that substantially and clearly it was always gonna be close guys it was gonna be a close race regardless because the country is so divided about what's going on but yeah it's it's it's substantially in play right now. Chuck we'd heard an awful lot about Arizona being in play but then we started seeing polling numbers that were saying it was certainly leaning Trump. I mean are we reading too much into those polling numbers I mean what you're saying sounds like everything is pretty well within the margins anyway. Yeah I think that's true I think the even the polling numbers when Biden was in his swoon post that debate you saw maybe three or five and the margin on most of these polls is two to four and so you know you see anything that's five it's in the margin just above the margin it's a one point swing one way or the other so you know now that Biden's off the ticket you know you're gonna get a bounce here with Harris as people look at this as an opportunity and the information machines if you want to call them that from both parties gear up for the for the campaign. Chuck Coughlin our guest right now he's president and CEO of high ground. Chuck do you think that's the case nationally as well and the other big swing states that are out there we'd heard just before President Biden decided he wouldn't seek reelection that other states were even no longer considered safe for the Democrats do you think Kamala Harris has shored those up and makes those other six to seven swing states back in play just like Arizona? I think so I mean I'm not I you know my expertise is in Arizona guys so sure my instinct is is the rest of the country is in a similar situation with different degrees of margin but yeah it's a whole new race you know it's I clearly Trump wanted to get a rematch with Biden that's what he wanted particularly after that debate performance and now they don't have that they're gonna have this other race now they're gonna have to retool what their messaging is gonna be she's gonna have to not only retool but duel to be what her message is gonna be how she's gonna approach this how is she gonna create contrast with that Republican ticket what's the best way for her to do that what she's been doing over the last several days as we've been seen is orchestrating this freight train of momentum of getting her the nomination and I think that as of today my understanding is she's locked up a majority of delegates I mean think about that from Sunday to now she's locked up a first a first party ballot nomination according to what everybody's saying of a nomination in Chicago and she then can a the next thing she's gonna do I would think is begin more seriously thinking about what her narrative is it's out there right now but admittedly under this you know wave of enthusiasm that's going on she's gonna she's gonna have to brook some headwinds and figure out what it's gonna be and then she's gonna have to focus on a vice presidential choice Chuck sorry Chuck the president CEO of high ground public affairs consultants and Chuck you you mentioned messaging and of course you're an expert when it comes to the campaign management the polling the polling and lobbying and everything that goes on behind the scenes eight years ago Kamala Harris ran for president her issue in the primaries people say she was a terrible candidate she she was doing well in the primaries except that her donation her campaign machine kind of fell out from under her as a candidate not bad but running a campaign disaster so yeah what is different now that she is that she starts with this apparatus already in place how much does she have input into what goes on as far as the messaging and things like that go and how much is she sort of a puppet of the campaign management well clearly a world a universe of difference compared to a competitive Democratic primary which the entire party was panicked about losing to Donald Trump and so they orchestrated as you know a primary in which Biden which they believed to be the only candidate could be Trump got the nomination they talked to everybody about getting out and they orchestrated the party the party apparatus orchestrated the conclusion there and gave Biden a path to run in he then shows her on the bottom of his ticket to express some support for the diversity of the Democratic Party not because she's from California because California is going to be always a locked up Democratic state so he chose her based on her record and her identity of you know being an African woman prosecutor and then put her on the bottom of the ticket today you know she's got four years as a vice presidential record she will have to defend that largely in the shadow of Biden and so now she's going to be able to go outside of that as you were just saying develop a narrative and that's going to be up to her team of consultants her pollsters in those I can think that what she will want to do is create a narrative with the starkest contrast with Trump you can already see that in the age thing now that she's the Democrats are starting to play the age game back on Trump yeah that's number one number two white male in the year of abortion that's happening all across the country here in Arizona in particular with a ballot initiative she's going to elevate that contrast and she'll continue to elevate additional contrast as she comes along and then prepare herself for her defense of the immigration record which I think nobody believes is a great record you can say there's been some massive accomplishments recently in the drawdown of immigration but man that's that's four years into the administration what took you so long yeah that's gonna be an issue for her and then she's gonna have to defend maybe some of her record that is less well known as a prosecutor in California and Trump and those folks are going to continue to bring that up but the most important thing that she's gonna have to do is develop that contrasting narrative you know in terms of you know Trump Trump and the wealthy versus her and a working-class guy you know he's up for tax cuts for the wealthy she's gonna play out the working-class guy she's gonna play up a desire to expand healthcare as we've done in Arizona to provide more health care opportunities to the working poor Trump's about you know getting rid of the Affordable Care Act those types of things that you know she can drive a narrative on back you know are you a friend of Putin there you friend is she she do you want to forfeit Taiwan and Ukraine well here's your guy I want to defend American freedom I think there's a lot of things that she can develop a sharp narrative on but she's gonna have to deliver that and she's in the middle I said this a couple times okay she's in the middle of this you know what I've called a some a Simone Biles double backflip twisting thing that you have to land in Chicago and that there's a lot going on I mean it is a massive operation moving forward one or two more quick ones for you Chuck and then we'll get you out of here you're the president and CEO of high ground Chuck Coughlin our guest right now you mentioned the VP selection a few moments ago what do you feel Mark Kelly would do for Kamala Harris and her campaign it's a safe pick it's a good pick because I do think it takes Arizona off the board marks one two straight elections in Arizona astronaut fighter pilot victim of gun violence married to Gabby Giffords payment from and a prolific fundraiser fantastic ad for Arizona a safe pick it's a safe pick for her to do what I would think you know you've got to think about this as a more ambitious pick would she choose like aggression Whitmer in Michigan would she choose to go to women at the top of the ticket in the year of abortion and and create the greatest possible contrast with that Republican ticket there's a lot of upside to that there's a huge amount of upside in the sense that you know it's begins to reestablish that Obama coalition of young people and young voters who were very enthusiastic about change we'd you know you have to acknowledge 104 years ago we didn't even allow women to vote and then they're going to say here it is 104 years later we're going to be running the country that kind of hope and change message can really motivate a bigger part of the Democratic base and the aspirational part of the Democratic base but it does it comes with a risk it comes with a risk how much do you lose on the other side of you know traditional you know rust belt white guy voters who go no not going for the two women at the ticket yeah you know there's a there's a calculus that goes on there i'm sure they got their polling in the field right now trying to figure out and answer all those questions Chuck Coughlin is the president and ceo of high ground public affairs consultants they deal with the campaign management polling lobbying uh can i call you a fixer chuck are you the fixer is that you i've been called worse all right very good Chuck Coughlin
