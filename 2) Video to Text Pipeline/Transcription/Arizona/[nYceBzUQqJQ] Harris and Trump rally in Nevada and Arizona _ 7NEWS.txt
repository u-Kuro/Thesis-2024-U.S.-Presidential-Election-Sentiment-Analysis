 Sprint to the finish for Donald Trump and Carmela Harris with both presidential candidates heading west today campaigning in Nevada and Arizona. US correspondent Tim Lester is in Phoenix. Tim times running out to win over voters in these crucial swing states. Tegan time running out won in the sense that the election finishes mid-next week here in the United States but also because so many have cast their ballot early. 60 million Americans have already voted about 155 million expected to vote in total so roughly 40 percent of the electorate is now beyond persuasion by these two candidates and both now focusing particularly on blunders on the other side to see if they can have an influence on the remaining 60 percent that way. I want to protect the women of our country. Well I'm gonna do it whether the women like it or not. It actually is I think very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives including their own bodies. That of course follows a day in which Donald Trump made so much of the garbage comments coming from President Biden. The insinuation that supporters of the Trump side of the campaign are garbage. He of course turned up in an event yesterday in a garbage truck to highlight that fact so a lot of those exchanges in play. Both of the presidential candidates here in the Sunbelt Western States today Arizona here where we expect shortly to see Kamala Harris. She and Donald Trump both will campaign just north of here in Nevada Reno and Las Vegas the bases there. The candidates in a big rush now to try to get this done before voting closes out meet next week.
