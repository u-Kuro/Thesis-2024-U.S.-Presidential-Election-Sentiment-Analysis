 Today, we're diving into the latest 2024 presidential election polls with a close look at two key battleground states. Georgia and Arizona. Will it be Harris or Trump who gains the upper hand? Let's get into the numbers. Starting with Georgia, we have data from TIP Insights. Three polls were conducted between September 16th and 18th, showing us some interesting results. Let's break it down. In the first poll, with 835 likely voters, the race is tied. 48% for Harris, 48% for Trump. That's right, no clear winner here. It's dead even. But in a second poll, with 1046 registered voters, Harris takes a slight lead at 46%, while Trump trails behind with 44%. That's a two-point lead for Harris. And finally, another poll with 835 likely voters shows the same 48% tie between both candidates. Georgia is really shaping up to be a nail biter. So Georgia seems to be a tight race with no clear front runner. Both candidates are neck and neck. Now let's move over to Arizona. Now in Arizona, we have three polls as well. Let's see how things are stacking up here. First, from Emerson College, conducted between September 15th and 18th, with 868 likely voters. This poll shows Trump leading by one point, with 50%, while Harris is close behind at 49%. But in a morning consult poll from September 9th to 18th, with 862 likely voters, Harris edges out Trump with a one-point lead at 48% to 47%. And finally, a Trafalgar Group poll from September 11th to 12th, with 1,088 likely voters, shows Trump with a two-point lead at 47%, over Harris's 46%. Just like Georgia, Arizona is proving to be a battleground state with fluctuating results. One poll gives Trump the edge, another favours Harris. It's clear both states will be crucial in deciding the 2024 election. So, what do you think of these results? Do you think Trump or Harris will take these states?
