 Oh, Abel, okay. Now we got some Republicans. They saying some shit. Now you got Republicans saying this now. These are Republicans. Now remember this. Wanna play it? Yeah, go ahead. That's why I want to tell him. I want him to hear it loud. Um, for us as Arizona Republicans to admit the obvious and to start saying the quiet part out loud, which is that our party's nominee is not qualified for office and that we need to vote for the for the adult in the room and that is Kamala Harris. It is time to put partisan loyalties aside and vote for the leadership that will truly represent the people we want to be in the eyes of the world. Character matters. I think the time for us is there. I mean, um, that's just a telling sign of goddamn, bro. Like even the goddamn white people don't like you. You know, they don't got no whites for Harris and nothing like that. They don't gotta talk about we white people like no, we Republicans, bro. Like we don't want your ass bitch. You know what I mean? Shit. I think I have blacks for Trump and shit like that. Like you gotta go out your way to be like call out a certain motherfucking section. This is not good. You're doing something wrong, but I mean people just see this shit and if they don't want his ass, what the fuck you gonna do for you? What can Trump do for you? I mean, okay, playing devil's advocate here. Cuz I know you I will already know what side you want. What's on him on? We know you don't know you you you against Trump. Yeah, I want to say what she is. Yeah, I can't yeah. Yeah, I can't say that. I'm just I'm just like, you know, could this be something that people who who saying not to vote for Kamala Harris is some things they might say. I just wanna see what your responses would be these things yeah. Yeah. Like okay one now you crazy cuz she said character matters right and and even I done seen that Kamala Harris does do this when she get in front of certain audiences she act a little different like she was talking to the people in Georgia. You know, I don't know we know damn well. She not no southern person, but she was talking with a southern accent and then you know and then she get in front of other people she talk different but also another thing is the fact that for a long time, she never like disclose that she was black until you know, I guess when she aligned herself with Joe Biden cuz I think even when she was when she was a DA wasn't she before she became before she got into politics like this in San Francisco, but I think she's sworn in as being Indian but I'm just saying what you say to those things. I don't care if she black white Puerto Rican Japanese, bro. That don't matter to me like you know what I mean like hood switch it up. Yes, been switch up all you want to cuz Trump vote and say these motherfuckers assholes these you know what I mean these people are this and that and you talking about that, bro. He come and call a bitch. The worst thing you could call a motherfucker, but you mad because this lady switching up her accent cuz she go to a different region. Like come on brother. This thing is really like no like that ain't what the **** **** **** Let's worry about policies and **** like that. You know what I mean? Come on, bro. Like talking about **** okay. If she wasn't black, who cares **** she's still better than Trump. Like straight the **** up. You see what he wanna do. We don't gotta talk about what he wanna do cuz we already know. You know what I mean? So y'all tell me how you feel about that like you see like I can ask you the same questions. You know what I'm saying? Like yo, how you feel about that **** If you come out here and call it, these are great people. These are these are are are patriots. They patriots cuz they storm that **** on January 6th yet it's not an insurrection. Why the **** they patriots then? You know what I mean? These people are heroes. These police is heroes but they get to shoot black ladies in their **** face and they're gonna get complete immunity or subjective immunity which who gonna be the person figuring out what the subject is a white sheriff or some **** like that. You know what I mean? Them **** is gonna be picking. They sending a conservative mother **** over the **** sheriff station. So if they don't deem that they don't feel like that **** was **** up **** it's immunity. So you I mean **** Hey, these are heroes. Them **** is heroes but these mother **** right here ain't heroes standing up saying the right **** thing. Yeah. Hey, definitely. They breathe. Yeah. Like I'm yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah. The Arizona Republicans. That's what you're talking about. Cuz just imagine if Trump win this ****. Yes, they done. That's brave as **** Yeah. Straight up. We know you're going. You're getting the **** out of here. Yeah, we gotta get it. I mean and even bro, you'd have heard him say it yourself. You won't have to worry about this in four years. You won't have to do it again. We'll have it fixed. What that mean to you? Well, like, why you feel about that since you're gonna say some **** about Harris? How do you feel about him saying that? Hey, what you think that mean? Oh, well, like I said, I was just being devil's advocate. Yeah, and I'm being a devil's advocate too. I'm because I don't I'm really I don't know. I don't I still don't know if I'm gonna vote yet. Like I don't know if I'm gonna vote even after hearing that. I don't know if I'm gonna vote for either one. You ain't got to but I'm saying even after hearing that. Hey, that is that **** spooky now. I don't. And then imagine if you didn't vote at all. That's it's imagine you not voting at all. It didn't that **** do happen. Like then you can't do nothing like you ain't even have a check like **** **** I'm **** up. Well, but when it comes to that, hey, okay, what you think about when people be saying I vote don't really matter anyway. I think that people that just say the popular vote don't matter anything. Well, we all know the popular vote is not what get people elected, right? And it's the electoral votes that get them elected. Yeah, but if yes, and that's why it's about **** you gotta vote. You know what I mean? So that the state get the electoral votes that you need. You know what I mean? That's why it's about voting. Popular vote could mean like you know what I mean? That's what a popular vote was our vote and the electoral votes is no other people you they count the votes twice one not twice, but one is for popular and one is for electoral. So you vote it's going to be for both like you know what I mean like that's your popular annual electoral vote, but you don't have an electoral vote. It's the the amount of people like the amount and so if Democrats went so if Democrats win a state, they get that electoral vote. You don't have to win the popular vote to win it the state. Yeah, cuz I don't see what what certain people want. I don't I don't heard the situation situation where the person who got the popular vote didn't become that's what happened. That's what happened with Hillary. She got the popular vote, but she didn't get the what she didn't get no states. She she won smaller states with low like some of these states have like it's the most all states don't have the same electoral votes. You know what I mean? Yes, they don't all states. She won a whole bunch of smaller states. You know what I mean, but they didn't have a bunch of people. Trump won all the **** states that had a whole bunch like a whole bunch of electoral votes, but in the last time, he lost by both. It was the most popular votes ever. Uh one. I mean, you know what I mean and what and electoral. I just man all this **** really for me. It's just confusing. And then you hear other stuff like you know how they say like I mean you ever heard people say how like you know black people started the Republican party. It was only a Democratic party which was the KKK basically was the **** and then we created a Republican party. But I don't know sometimes when I think about when is with this whole politics **** I think they they both they they they both sides of the same coin like you know what I'm saying like it's the same chord just another side because I like I don't know and it's just. I don't know this **** hard to know what to believe. We've been voting for Democrat for so long and things our conditions have not changed. If not, they've been gotten worse. Our conditions ain't changed because of us though. That ain't got nothing to do with it and because like you just said, you don't even know if you're gonna vote. So you don't even like you're not even but you're not even. Why? Why though? Like why I don't know if you're gonna be. You explain some dumb **** reasons. Huh? Like you should still at least try to figure out a reason to vote for somebody and I don't mean just for president because like you said, if you want things to change for you, you need to know locally. Yeah, locally. That's why you need. All right. You know what I mean? You need to see who the governor next governor gonna be because it's gonna be a governor. race too. Yeah. So it even down to um remember we had um the one lady that was **** stealing for the longest time. Like and people are electing her or you know what I mean? Most of the time, they'll get elected because like you said, you don't even know if you're gonna vote. So that means you won't even go down now. So you know what I mean? That's that's an empty. That's an empty what you call right there like so somebody who go vote every **** year and they vote for the same people every year. They gonna **** stay there. Well, see a lot of people when they vote Democrat um when they vote Democrat. Presidentially when they vote locally, they vote Democrat, but you don't have to. I know you don't have to but that's what but that's what most people do like when you one side, you one side like I most of the time if you if you Democratic, then you're gonna be Democratic at all levels. Well, I mean I the last time we voted was for governor and I voted for DeSantis just because I like that that the state was open so I can work still like you know what I mean and **** I ain't know that he was gonna come with all that **** race **** after that like you know what I mean? He wasn't doing all that **** then but like the second term, that's where he came in with all the getting rid of you know what I mean? African American studies and **** like that and that's not right because **** these motherfuckers really wanna be at like they didn't have no hand in the **** that you know what I mean? We do go through but at the end of the day, I don't one sided cuz II be wanting motherfuckers to have lifetime terms to be voted out. You know what I mean? Because nobody needs to be there for a lifetime. So **** like that like I all I always like in Congress and **** like that um you know **** Congressmen **** they be having different motherfucking views. But I try to get a little bit informed on all that **** but like back to what you said when you said like yo, we **** haven't changed because of us. Yeah, but at the same time though like these Democrats one of the reasons we haven't a lot of black people don't because they looking for some type of politician to help them and they in the Democratic Party Lexus. I mean try to convince. I mean not everybody but a lot of motherfuckers be thinking they are gonna do something to help us and that's why they vote Democrat most of the time you get **** done to help you cuz like it like like you got student loans. Are you paying them right now? How much you paying right now for them? Who did that? Like you know what I mean? You you know what I mean? Like you had to **** figure out how I'm gonna pay these bills, right? Yeah, he take away my damn loans and **** stand up. I mean you ain't get some type of help on it. I mean some type of relief. No **** I be getting you didn't apply for it. That's probably cuz I can see you as being a motherfucker who didn't even apply for it. But I think it was for like a like only for like 10,000. No, it's not. Yeah, you got you. I mean you don't even the lesson you showed me now. You don't even take advantage of what so you can't even be you can't even **** talk about nothing. Yeah, but that ain't what I mean but that's what that's what happened with black people as a whole as a community. I mean that's how black people started buying houses and **** because apart that that that student loan **** was a big part of people's credit not being good. Once that's not just black people, that's everybody. It's all people going to college more than we is. So if anything they helping more white people get rid of they college than us. I guess so. Yeah. But well, it's just that that's something if you if you black and you went to college, it's gonna help you but for the most part, who did that help? White student. Like what I wasn't even thinking about it like that but it's like but I'm just saying like you know, but I don't know though. I'm probably gonna end up voting for if I do vote, I'm probably gonna end up voting for Kamala Harris just because that project 2025. **** even though Trump said he got nothing to do with that. I think he like like and I just feel like we can't let that happen. **** I don't know what a **** gonna happen. I don't know. **** but what do we vote? What we we can get it done. It's project. 2025 still happen. I mean, that's a conservative. That's a conservative plan. It is though. They not conservative at all like that is the that is if that happens, that is got the emperor Palpatine taking over but okay. Has it been has it been? Like that project 2025 thing is real. It's just an outline for what they wanna do. Yeah. Cuz I seen this black lady. She had the guy who wrote certain parts of it. They was in like on some type of court. They was talking discussing it. Yes. And he was like and she was saying certain things and he was like, yeah, that's a good plan. Like he was like, yeah, like that's good. Yeah. No. And she was pointing out a lot of the stuff and it's like, man, that **** just crazy like some of the things they wanna do and it's like. But hey, Republican speaking now against the Republican candidate, man. I mean, **** what did Trump do for your ass though? Hey, man, I feel like ain't no president ever agenda is to help black people. I don't give a **** who got there like I'm I'm wanna talk more for like black people. Like you said, we gotta help our **** like that. It ain't no president from the common. I don't think that there's no politician. But it's some people that can make it worse for us. Yeah, it's always some people that can make it worse for us. It's always be. Yeah, yeah, it's some people that can make it worse for the end of the day. We gotta pull ourself up out this **** cuz they ain't trying to help us. All we can do is is vote on what's gonna make the the country better as a whole so we can do that. Yeah. And **** I think. Man, not even not even cuz I ain't **** you know what I mean? **** I'm I'm I'm in full belief that Trump will win because **** **** everyone they more will always be you know what I mean? Trump Trump Trump Trump. I think Trump go weird because I don't know. I mean, maybe I don't know. You can call me what you want to but I just don't see them letting a woman be the president. I just don't see it. No, it's gonna be a it'll have to happen. It'll be a woman president. **** it soon. Yeah, for sure. Like it just it's just that time. Yeah, it's just that time. But hey, man. Not even about talk about letting them do it like it just **** like **** just like of color. I see it being a white woman before it be a woman of color like even if she wasn't black and she was full Indian, she would still be a woman of color. It gotta be a gotta be gotta be a woman of color. Disney writing a script cut. Hey, Disney Disney woke like a **** with a wide open and the alarm clock still going on. That **** don't shut off. It just rang all day long when they woke. Alright.
