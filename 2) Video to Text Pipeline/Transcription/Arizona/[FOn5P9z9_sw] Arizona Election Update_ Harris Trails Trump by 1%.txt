 However, the story is different in Arizona. Harris is trailing there by 1% with 47.6% against Trump's 48.6%. Together, they add up to 93 of the electoral college's 538 votes and 18% of the population. North Carolina and Georgia, which are still dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, seem dissatisfied with the Democrats and are leaning towards Trump. With 16 electoral votes each, both states are expected to go red with Trump leading by over 1%. North Carolina, typically leaning towards one party, has proven unpredictable this cycle as both candidates compete for the remaining undecided voter. Nevada also tells a different story with six electoral votes. The state remains blue currently showing Harris with a 48.4% support compared to Trump's 47.3%. Michigan, on the other hand, remains highly competitive.
