 What's an issue that concerns you most going into the election and beyond? That's a good question. I would say aside from the cost of living, it would be employment. My name is Mitchell Holzma. My name is Nicole Spreitzer. My name is Tarun Masepeda. I'm studying anthropology in German. I'm currently studying global business. I'm studying social work and I go to ASU. I go to the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University. Employment is a very big thing. My biggest issue is trying to find a job after graduation. With the development of AI, I'm concerned that there are a lot of jobs in the future that are not going to exist. With all the AI stuff, there's not a whole bunch of certainty as far as like, is the job that I'm currently studying for even going to be relevant 10 years from now? Climate change is a huge importance. I believe that climate change should be addressed a lot. The climate issue. It's key to all the resources. Climate change. I feel like it's such a big thing. We have a lot of water shortages and lack of access to the water. I think globally that's something that we can sort of look into and assist. Tariffs to keep up with the NATO efforts. Healthcare right now. The medical issue in USA, it should be actually free for everyone, not for it to be as expensive as compared to other countries. The lack of trust in institutions. The lack of polarity of the country and the division that's going to be hosted, but that our community is. There are a lot of wars right now. At what point do we come together and focus on what matters most? I hope that whichever candidate is to win, the losing side, I guess, is able to just be at peace with the result and just be able to unify the nation. What can we do to shape the future to how we want to shape the future?
