 Vice President Kamala Harris is calling on stars to help her make her final pitches of the 2024 campaign while former President Donald Trump is relying on familiar tactics. Natalie Brand has more from the campaign trail. Vice President Kamala Harris departed one battleground for another heading to Georgia for a star studded rally tonight with former President Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen. The turnout is massive. We know what we're fighting for. On the campaign trail for Harris this month, Obama has focused on black men with some party leaders concerned about turnout. It's not what I see in terms of my rallies, in terms of interactions I'm having with people in communities and on the ground. What I'm saying is in equal measure, men and women talking about their concerns about the future of our democracy. Some voters waiting in line to see the vice president say she still has work to do. It's real because so many younger people are misinformed. With just 12 days left in the race for the White House, former President Donald Trump headed west for rallies in Arizona and Nevada spotlighting his signature issue immigration. Immediately upon taking the oath of office I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. In Georgia Wednesday night, Trump stepped up his attacks on the vice president and the Biden administration's border policies. They walk through that open border and probably say man are these people stupid and then they start to kill, they kill. The Trump campaign is hoping to flip Arizona back to their column after the former president lost the state by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020. Natalie Brand, CBS News, the White House.
