 OK, so get this. We're diving into some poll numbers today. And let me tell you, they are something else. We're talking about Kamala Harris in the lead in Texas, Georgia, A&D, Arizona. Like what? Yeah, it's causing a bit of a frenzy, you could say. These polls are dropping just weeks before the election and they're showing what was once a sure thing for Republicans is suddenly, well, not so sure anymore. It's kind of mind blowing, right? I mean, a Democrat winning Texas last time that happened, it was what? Jimmy Carter back in 76 wild. So let's unpack this, shall we? What's behind this seismic shift? And let's start with Texas. The Texas Tribune has Harris ahead 49 percent to 48 percent. Sure, it's slim, but still in Texas. What's going on? So it's a whole bunch of things coming together. We've seen this trend, right? Big cities, Houston, Dallas, Austin, Leaning Democrat. But here's the kicker. Harris is support. It's not just contained to the cities anymore. She's gaining ground in the suburbs. And that that's got Republicans worried. That's their turf, historically speaking. Interesting, because we always hear how important those suburban voters are. But why Harris specifically in Texas? Is it something she's doing, something in the air down there? So the Texas Tribune poll, they actually dig into this a little bit. It seems like it's a couple of things. One, her stance on economic recovery seems to be hitting home with middle class families, especially with all the ups and downs we've been having lately. Plus her focus on health care, making it more affordable. That's resonating, too, particularly with, you know, costs going through the roof and all. Connecting with those everyday concerns I see. And it's not just a Texas thing, is it? Georgia, another one. Biden barely snatched in 2020. Emory University has Harris not just holding on, but actually up by three points now. What's fueling her in the Peach State? Black voter turnout, it's through the roof. That's definitely part of it. And Harris talking about voting rights. That's resonating big time, especially with younger voters, minority groups, folks who feel like their voices aren't being heard, you know. Tapping into that desire for change for progress, which leads us to Arizona. Another 2020 flip. And the Arizona Republic has her up by two points there. Same story. Different state changing demographics, shifting priorities. Or is Arizona its own beast? You got it. It's like you're reading my mind. Arizona, it's got a lot of the same stuff going on. Yeah. Yeah. Growing Latino population, definitely making a difference at the polls. And those suburbs, yeah, those priorities are changing there, too. Like when we're talking about immigration reform, climate change, making health care affordable, Harris, she's got plans and people seem to be responding. Like these issues, they've always been there, but now it's different. It's like they're deciding things. Exactly. But here's where Arizona gets, well, even more interesting. It's got its own little twist. The Republican Party, they're having a bit of an internal crisis, you could say. Basically, the old guard they're clashing with, well, the more. How should I put this? The far right folks. And this little battle they've got going on, it's pushing some Republicans, more moderate ones, you know, the kind who'd usually vote red no matter what they're looking at Harris. Maybe they don't agree with her on everything, but she seems less extreme. Someone who can, you know, bring people together. Wow. So it's like this whole internal party drama is actually spilling out, changing how people vote. OK, so we've got changing demographics, people caring about different things. And now even parties themselves falling apart. It's like American politics is getting a makeover right in front of us. Nailed it. And it kind of makes you wonder, right? Could all of this actually lead to like a massive upset this November? Think about it. Texas, Georgia, A&D, Arizona all going blue. We're talking 67 electoral votes just like that. That's huge. Usually those are a guaranteed win for the Republicans. But this year, they could be what decides everything. It's that close. I bet losing those 67 votes would be a real gut punch for any Republican candidate. I mean, it's early days, right? And we've all seen how elections can be. Anything can happen. But just the fact that this is even possible, that's a big deal. Seems like nobody knows what's going to happen. Right. And let's not forget polls. They're just a snapshot. Right. Things change in the margin of error. Got to factor that in. But honestly, what's going to be key here is turnout. Every single vote, it matters maybe more than ever. Getting everyone registered out to the polls. That's going to be job number one for both parties. Yeah. But yeah, even with all that, just the fact that Harris is even in the running in these states, that says something. It's like people are changing what they care about is changing. And maybe, just maybe the old way of doing things, it's not working anymore. One hundred percent. This isn't just about the selection. It's bigger than that. It's like American politics. It's shifting, rearranging itself in Texas, Georgia, Arizona. They're like the canaries in the coal mine showing us what might be coming next. So we've gone through all of this. But what does it really mean? Like for the future? Is this it? Is the map the one we're used to seeing every four years? Is that like over the million dollar question? Right. It's like, are these changes in Texas, Georgia, Arizona? Are they just a blip? Or are we seeing the beginning of something, something much bigger? Something that changes everything. States that used to be like, sure, things now they're up for grabs. The new battlegrounds makes you think those political strategists, the ones with their fancy maps, they might need to go back to the drawing board. Right. And you know what this highlights? It's all about the voters. Getting them registered, getting them to the polls and really understanding like what matters to them, what are they worried about in their own lives? Because if this keeps up, it's not just about who wins the White House anymore. It's about those voters, the ones who are changing their minds, especially in those suburbs, the ones nobody thought would ever change. The game's changed. So for our listeners out there and I know they're hooked on this whole election drama. What's the one thing they should take away from all of this? Here's the thing. Politics, it's not set in stone. It changes, it moves. And right now we're seeing those changes happen right before our eyes. And it's exciting, but it's also like, whoa, what's next? I mean, a Democrat winning Texas, Georgia, Aining, Arizona, a few years ago, you'd have been laughed out of the room for even suggesting it. Now it's actually possible. Talk about a reality check. No matter what side you're on, that's a big deal. It's like everything we thought we knew, maybe we don't. Exactly. And it makes you think, right? If this keeps going, what happens to American politics? What about new parties, new ideas? How are things going to work from now on? It's definitely a fascinating time to be paying attention.
