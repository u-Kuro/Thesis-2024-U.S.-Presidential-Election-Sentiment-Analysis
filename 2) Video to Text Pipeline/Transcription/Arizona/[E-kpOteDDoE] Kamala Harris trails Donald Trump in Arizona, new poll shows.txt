 Now, new Fox polls show how it's shaping up. Trump's starting to build a lead here in Arizona, although it's still right on the edge of the margin of error, which is three and a half. He's got a three-point lead, 51 to 48. Georgia, 51 to 48 the other way, with Kamala Harris. Overall, voters trust Trump more on immigration, inflation, and the economy, but they overwhelmingly trust Harris on abortion. Kamala Harris is going to spend the weekend traveling to key states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Harris, of course, will be here in Arizona later today, although the full details of her trip have still not been released. The last time that Kamala Harris was in Arizona, you might remember it, was that big rally at the Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale. That's been about seven weeks. It comes amid a report today from Politico that her campaign, that we shouldn't be shocked that it's already been close to two months, because she's really going to focus, these last few weeks, on fewer Sunbelt states and more on those big three Rust Belt states, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Guys. So, Ron, will this be her first trip to the Arizona-Mexico border down in Douglas? I think that's correct. She did make one other previous very brief visit, but I think that was in Texas.
