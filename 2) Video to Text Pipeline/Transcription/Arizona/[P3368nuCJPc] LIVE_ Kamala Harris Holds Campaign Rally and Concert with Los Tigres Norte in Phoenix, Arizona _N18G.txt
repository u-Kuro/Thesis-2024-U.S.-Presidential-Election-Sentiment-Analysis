 He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly. But we trust women. We trust women. Which is why, yes, we will vote because we also understand if he was elected, he has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds. He will ban abortion nationwide. He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. And you don't have to take my word for it, just Google Project 2025. Read the plans for yourself. And I think everyone here knows that we can agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. Not the government. Not the government. So Arizona, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, I would recommend you vote yes on Proposition 139. And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right. And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. So Arizona, I'm here to ask for your vote, which I would be so honored to have. And here is my pledge to you. As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I will tell you I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. And I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me. And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. Because that's how a democracy works. And that's how real leaders work. And I pledge to you to always put country above party and above self and to be a president for all Americans. That is my sincere pledge to you. And so Phoenix, with five days left in this campaign, my opponent is also making his closing argument to America. And you've probably seen a bit of it. It is an argument that is full of hate and division. He insults Latinos, scapegoats, immigrants, and it's not just what he says, it's what he will do. If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies. Only on a much greater scale than last time. And it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump. We are done with that. So five days out and it all comes down to this. We are here together and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life and your busy schedules. You have taken the time to be here because I know we all love our country. We love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. You fight for it. Yes. And with that spirit and with this spirit, we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, the love that we have for our country, is to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what this is about. And I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller. And people during that time would come together from every walk of life, together from every background, every race, and come together to fight for freedom and opportunity. When I was growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her two daughters the same chances our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love, who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith. I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out, but never stopped believing that anything in our country is possible. I have lived the promise of America. And today, I see the promise of America in everyone here, in all of you. I see the promise of America in the women who refuse to accept the future without reproductive freedom, and the men who support them, in the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future, in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States before a party. And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. Where are you? Let me see you. And I love this generation of leaders. You are rightly, I mean, you guys are rightly impatient for change. And you are determined to live free from gun violence, to tackle the climate crisis, to shake the world you inherit. And for our young leaders, here's the thing. None of this is theoretical for them. It's not political. For you all, it is your lived experience. And I see you. And I see your incredible power. And I am so proud of you. So can we hear it for the first time voters who are here? Although why aren't you guys in class? It's okay. So Arizona, we have five days to get this done. And no one can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next five days so that when we look back on these five days, we'll know we did everything we could. So let's knock on doors. Let's text and call voters. Let's reach out to family and friends and neighbors and coworkers and classmates. And as we do, here's my request. Let us please be intentional about building community. Let us be intentional about building coalitions. You know, there's been so much about these last several years that is making people feel alone, making people point their fingers at each other as though we're not all in this together. So let's approach this with the spirit that is about bringing folks back together and reminding everyone the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. So let's approach it that way. We will be the stronger for it. And always remember, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. So Arizona, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? Proven leader, a champion for all of Arizona. And please send him to the United States Senate. So it's so good to be back in Arizona and Phoenix. Are we ready to do this? Are we ready to vote? Are we ready to win? Oh, it's good to be back and to be with so many incredible leaders. I love you back. I want to thank Governor Hobbs, Senator Kelly, Gabby Giffords, Mayors Gallego, Romero and Giles, Ambassador Jeff Flake. I am so grateful to all of you for your support. And to all the tribal leaders, the elected leaders, community leaders here today. I thank you. And let's hear it again for Los Tigres del Norte. Okay, work to do. So Arizona, tomorrow, Friday, November, by the way, happy Halloween. So tomorrow, Friday, November 1st, is the last day to vote early in person. And if you are voting by mail and still have your ballot, please take it to any dropbox in your county or any voting location by 7 p.m. on Tuesday, November 5th. And you can go to iwillvote.com to get all the information you need. And to all the leaders here, please help spread the word on that. Okay? And we need you to vote Arizona because we have five days left. Five days left. In one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we have work to do. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We will win. And we will win because we know that it's very clear to all of us here, when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. And we love our country. And we love our country. And we know in this election, we have an opportunity to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're exhausted with that. And we know, and we know that's who he is. But Phoenix, that is not who we are. That is not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next President of the United States. And Arizona, many of you know me. I'm not afraid of tough fights. For decades, I was a prosecutor. I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in our country. And I have won fights. I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children. And we are fighting for democracy. And that's all right. That's all right. Democracy can be complicated, but we believe in democracy and the right of everyone to have their voices heard. It's all right. And I have fought for many who have harmed other human beings. I have fought against the cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings. And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as President, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. And look, we all know who Donald Trump is. This is not because here's the thing we all know. He is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, it will either be him or me in the Oval Office. Yes, we're going to get this done. And I thank you. I thank you. And here's the thing, because we're really clear and we can all picture it. We can picture the Oval Office, right? And if he is elected, on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. On day one, when I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. And on top of my list is bringing down Sisé Puede, Si. And on top of my list in that spirit is bringing down your cost of living. It's an issue that we need to address and it will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. I will fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. And if you are caring for an elderly parent, look, I took care of my mother when she was sick. If you are taking care of an elderly parent, I understand what you are experiencing. And my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare for the seniors in your life who need help and support. Because so much of my plan for me is about the dignity that all people deserve, which is why my plan includes lowering the cost of child care, cutting taxes for small businesses, and lowering health care costs. Do we have small businesses in the house? I will focus on health care because this is where I come from. I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the... Hey guys, you know what? Here's the thing. Let's talk for a moment about Gaza. We all want this war to end and get the hostages out, and I will work on it full time when I am elected president as I've been. And I have yours. So there's a contrast in this election on so many issues, including our plans for America's economy. Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time. Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest corporations, and this time he will pay for it. And this time his plan is a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Clothes, food, toys, cell phones. A Trump sales tax, according to the Economist, would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year. And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and he has a powerful friend in Congress, the Speaker of the House, who recently said if Trump wins, there will be, quote, no Obamacare, which would throw... Understand the meaning of that. It would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance and take us back to the time which we remember when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And Donald Trump's not done. Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday? That he will do what he wants, quote, and here's where I'm going to quote, whether the women like it or not. And we must vote because this is the thing. You know, there's a saying that you've got to listen to people when they tell you who they are. And this is not the first time he has told us who he is. He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies. This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices. He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly. But we trust women. We trust women. Which is why, yes, we will vote because we also understand if he was elected, he has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds. He will ban abortion nationwide. He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. And you don't have to take my word for it. Just Google Project 2025. Read the plans for yourself. And I think everyone here knows that we can agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. Not the government. Not the government. So, Arizona, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, I would recommend you vote yes on Proposition 139. And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right. And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom. As President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. So, Arizona, I'm here to ask for your vote, which I would be so honored to have. And here is my pledge to you. As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I will tell you I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. And I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me. And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. Because that's how a democracy works. And that's how real leaders work. And I pledge to you to always put country above party and above self and to be a president for all Americans. That is my sincere pledge to you. And so Phoenix, with five days left in this campaign, my opponent is also making his closing argument to America. And you've probably seen a bit of it.

You are rightly, I mean, you guys are rightly impatient for change. And you are determined to live free from gun violence, to tackle the climate crisis, to shake the world you inherit. And for our young leaders, here's the thing, none of this is theoretical for them. It's not political. For you all, it is your lived experience. And I see you. And I see your incredible power. And I am so proud of you. So can we hear it for the first time voters who are here? Although why aren't you guys in class? It's okay.

So let's approach it that way. Let's approach it that way. We will be the stronger for it. And always remember, your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. So Arizona, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? Proven leader, a champion for all of Arizona, and please send him to the United States Senate. So it's so good to be back in Arizona and Phoenix. Are we ready to do this? Are we ready to vote? Are we ready to win? Oh, it's good to be back and to be with so many incredible leaders. I love you back.

And we need you to vote, Arizona, because we have five days left. Five days left. In one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we have work to do. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We will win. We will win. And we will win because we know that it's very clear to all of us here, when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. And we love our country. And we love our country. And we know in this election, we have an opportunity to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're exhausted with that. And we know, and we know that's who he is. But Phoenix, that is not who we are. That is not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States. And Arizona, many of you know me, I'm not afraid of tough fights. For decades, I was a prosecutor, I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in our country. And I have won fights. I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children. And we are fighting for democracy. And that's all right. That's all right. Democracy can be complicated, but we believe in democracy and the right of everyone to have their voices heard. It's all right. And I have fought for many who have harmed other human beings. I have fought against the cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings. And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. And look, we all know who Donald Trump is. This is not... Because here's the thing we all know. He is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, it will either be him or me in the Oval Office. Yes, we're going to get this done. And I thank you. I thank you. And here's the thing, because we're really clear and we can all picture it. We can picture the Oval Office, right? And if he is elected, on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. On day one, when I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. And on top of my list is bringing down Sí, se puede, sí. Sí, se puede. And on top of my list in that spirit is bringing down your cost of living. It's an issue that we need to address and it will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. I will fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. And if you are caring for an elderly parent, look, I took care of my mother when she was sick. If you are taking care of an elderly parent, I understand what you are experiencing and my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare for the seniors in your life who need help and support. Because so much of my plan for me is about the dignity that all people deserve, which is why my plan includes lowering the cost of child care, getting taxes for small businesses and lowering health care costs. Do we have small businesses in the house? I will focus on health care because this is where I come from. I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the, hey guys, you know what, here's the thing. Let's talk for a moment about Gaza. We all want this war to end and get the hostages out and I will work on it full time when I am elected president as I've been. And I have yours. So there is a contrast in this election on so many issues, including our plans for America's economy. Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time. Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest corporations and this time he will pay for it. And this time his plan is a 20 percent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Clothes, food, toys, cell phones. A Trump sales tax, according to the Economist, would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year. And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. And he has a powerful friend in Congress, the Speaker of the House, who recently said if Trump wins, there will be, quote, no Obamacare, which would throw, understand the meaning of that, it would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance and take us back to the time which we remember when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade and they did as he intended. And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And Donald Trump's not done. Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday? That he will do what he wants, quote, and here's where I'm going to quote, whether the women like it or not. And we must vote because this is the thing. You know, there's a saying that got to listen to people when they tell you who you are or who they are. And this is not the first time he has told us who he is. He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies. This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices. He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly. But we trust women. We trust women. Which is why, yes, we will vote because we also understand if he was elected, he has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds. He will ban abortion nationwide. He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. And you don't have to take my word for it. Just Google Project 2025. Read the plans for yourself. And I think everyone here knows that we can agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. Not the government. Not the government. So Arizona, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, I would recommend you vote yes on Proposition 139. And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right. And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. So Arizona, I'm here to ask for your vote, which I would be so honored to have. And here is my pledge to you. As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I will tell you I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. And I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me. And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. And so he wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. Because that's how a democracy works. And that's how real leaders work. And I pledge to you to always put country above party and above self and to be a President for all Americans. That is my sincere pledge to you. And so Phoenix, with five days left in this campaign, my opponent is also making his closing argument to America. And you've probably seen a bit of it. It is an argument that is full of hate and division. He insults Latinos, scapegoats, immigrants, and it's not just what he says, it's what he will do. If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies. Only on a much greater scale than last time. And it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump. We are done with that. So five days out and it all comes down to this. We are here together and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life and your busy schedules. You have taken the time to be here because I know we all love our country. We love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. You fight for it. And with that spirit and with this spirit, we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, the love that we have for our country, is to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what this is about. And I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller. And people during that time would come together from every walk of life, together from every background, every race, and come together to fight for freedom and opportunity. Growing up, when I was growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her two daughters the same chances our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love, who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith. I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out, but never stopped believing that anything in our country is possible. I have lived the promise of America. And today, I see the promise of America in everyone here, in all of you. I see the promise of America. In the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. And the men who support them. In the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future. And Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States before a party. And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. Where are you? Let me see you. And I love this generation of leaders. You are rightly, I mean you guys are rightly impatient for change. And you are determined to live free from gun violence, to tackle the climate crisis, to shake the world you inherit. You are our young leaders. Here's the thing, none of this is theoretical for them. It's not political. For you all, it is your lived experience. And I see you. And I see your incredible power. And I am so proud of you. So can we hear it for the first time voters who are here? Although why aren't you guys in class? It's okay. So Arizona, we have five days to get this done. And no one can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next five days so that when we look back on these five days, we'll know we did everything we could. So let's knock on doors. Let's text and call voters. Let's reach out to family and friends and neighbors and coworkers and classmates. And as we do, here is my request. Let us please be intentional about building community. Let us be intentional about building coalitions. You know, there's been so much about these last several years that is making people feel alone, making people point their fingers at each other as though we're not all in this together. So let's approach this with the spirit that is about bringing folks back together and reminding everyone the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. So let's approach it that way. Let's approach it that way. We will be the stronger for it. And always remember, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. So Arizona, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? Proven leader, a champion for all of Arizona, and please send him to the United States Senate. So it's so good to be back in Arizona and Phoenix. Are we ready to do this? Are we ready to vote? Are we ready to win? Oh, it's good to be back and to be with so many incredible leaders. I love you back. I want to thank Governor Hobbs, Senator Kelly, Gabby Giffords, Mayors Gallego, Romero and Giles, Ambassador Jeff Flake. I am so grateful to all of you for your support. And to all the tribal leaders, the elected leaders, community leaders here today. I thank you. And let's hear it again for Los Tigres del Norte. Okay, work to do. So Arizona, tomorrow, Friday, November 1st. By the way, Happy Halloween. So tomorrow, Friday, November 1st, is the last day to vote early in person. And if you are voting by mail and still have your ballot, please take it to any drop box in your county or any voting location by 7 p.m. on Tuesday, November 5th. And you can go to Iwillvote.com to get all the information you need. And to all the leaders here, please help spread the word on that. And we need you to vote Arizona because we have five days left. Five days left. In one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we have work to do. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. And we will win because we know that it's very clear to all of us here, when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. And we love our country. And we love our country. And we know in this election, we have an opportunity to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're exhausted with that. And we know, and we know that's who he is. But Phoenix, that is not who we are. That is not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next President of the United States. And Arizona, many of you know me, I'm not afraid of tough fights. For decades, I was a prosecutor. I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in our country. And I have won fights. I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children. And we are fighting for democracy. And that's all right. That's all right. Democracy can be complicated, but we believe in democracy and the right of everyone to have their voices heard. It's all right. And I have fought for many who have harmed other human beings. I have fought against the cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings. And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as President, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. And look, we all know who Donald Trump is. This is not... Because here's the thing we all know. He is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, it will either be him or me in the Oval Office. Yes, we're going to get this done. And I thank you. I thank you. And here's the thing, because we're really clear and we can all picture it. We can picture the Oval Office, right? And if he is elected on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. On day one, when I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. And on top of my list is bringing down Sisé Puede, Si. Si, se puede. Si, se puede. Si, se puede. Si, se puede. Si, se puede. And on top of my list in that spirit is bringing down your cost of living. It's an issue that we need to address and it will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. I will fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. And if you are caring for an elderly parent, look, I took care of my mother when she was sick. If you are taking care of an elderly parent, I understand what you are experiencing and my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare for the seniors in your life who need help and support.

He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. And you don't have to take my word for it. Just Google Project 2025. Read the plans for yourself. And I think everyone here knows that we can agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. Not the government. Not the government. So Arizona, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, I would recommend you vote yes on Proposition 139. And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right. And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. So Arizona, I'm here to ask for your vote, which I would be so honored to have. And here is my pledge to you. As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I will tell you I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. And I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me. And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. Because that's how a democracy works. That's how real leaders work. And I pledge to you to always put country above party and above self, and to be a president for all Americans. That is my sincere pledge to you. And so Phoenix, with five days left in this campaign, my opponent is also making his closing argument to America. And you've probably seen a bit of it. It is an argument that is full of hate and division. He insults Latinos, scapegoats, immigrants. And it's not just what he says, it's what he will do. If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies. Only on a much greater scale than last time. And it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump. We are done with that. So five days out, and it all comes down to this. We are here together, and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life, and your busy schedules. You have taken the time to be here. Because I know we all love our country. We love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. You fight for it. And with that spirit, and with this spirit, we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, the love that we have for our country, is to then fight for its ideals. And to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what this is about. And I have always believed in our nation's promise, because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller. And people during that time would come together from every walk of life, together from every background, every race, and come together to fight for freedom and opportunity. Growing up, when I was growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her two daughters the same chances our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love, who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith. I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out, but never stopped believing that anything in our country is possible. I have lived the promise of America. And today, I see the promise of America in everyone here, in all of you. I see the promise of America in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. And the men who support them, in the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future, in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States before our party. And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. Where are you? Let me see you. And I love this generation of leaders. You are rightly, I mean, you guys are rightly impatient for change. You are determined to live free from gun violence, to tackle the climate crisis, to shake the world you inherit. And for our young leaders, here's the thing, none of this is theoretical for them. It's not political. For you all, it is your lived experience. And I see you. And I see your incredible power. And I am so proud of you. So can we hear it for the first time voters who are here? Although why aren't you guys in class? Okay. So Arizona, we have five days to get this done. And no one can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next five days so that when we look back on these five days, we'll know we did everything we could. So let's knock on doors. Let's text and call voters. Let's reach out to family and friends and neighbors and coworkers and classmates. And as we do, here is my request. Let us please be intentional about building community. Let us be intentional about building coalitions. You know, there's been so much about these last several years that is making people feel alone, making people point their fingers at each other as though we're not all in this together. So let's approach this with the spirit that is about bringing folks back together and reminding everyone the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. So let's approach it that way. Let's approach it that way. We will be the stronger for it. And always remember, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. So, Arizona, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? Proven leader, a champion for all of Arizona, and please send him to the United States Senate. So it's so good to be back in Arizona and Phoenix. Are we ready to do this? Are we ready to vote? Are we ready to win? Oh, it's good to be back and to be with so many incredible leaders. I love you back. I want to thank Governor Hobbs, Senator Kelly, Gabby Giffords, Mayors Gallego, Romero and Giles, Ambassador Jeff Flake. I am so grateful to all of you for your support. And to all the tribal leaders, the elected leaders, community leaders here today. I thank you. And let's hear it again for Los Tigres Del Norte. Okay, work to do. So, Arizona, tomorrow, Friday, November 1st. By the way, happy Halloween. So tomorrow, Friday, November 1st, is the last day to vote early in person. And if you are voting by mail and still have your ballot, please take it to any drop box in your county or any voting location by 7 p.m. on Tuesday, November 5th. And you can go to iwillvote.com to get all the information you need. And to all the leaders here, please help spread the word on that. And we need you to vote, Arizona, because we have five days left. Five days left. In one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we have work to do. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We will win. We will win. And we will win because we know that it's very clear to all of us here, when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. And we love our country. And we love our country. And we know in this election, we have an opportunity to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're exhausted with that. And we know, and we know that's who he is. But Phoenix, that is not who we are. That is not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States. And Arizona, many of you know me. I'm not afraid of tough fights. For decades, I was a prosecutor. I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in our country. And I have won fights. I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children. And we are fighting for democracy. And that's all right. That's all right. Democracy can be complicated, but we believe in democracy in the right of everyone to have their voices heard. It's all right. And I have fought for many who have harmed other human beings. I have fought against the cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings. And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. And look, we all know who Donald Trump is. This is not because here's the thing we all know. He is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, it will either be him or me in the Oval Office. Yes, we're going to get this done. And I thank you. I thank you. And here's the thing, because we're really clear and we can all picture it. We can picture the Oval Office, right? And if he is elected on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. On day one, when I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. And on top of my list is bringing down Sisé Puede, Si. And on top of my list in that spirit is bringing down your cost of living. It's an issue that we need to address and it will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. I will fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. And if you are caring for an elderly parent, look, I took care of my mother when she was sick. If you are taking care of an elderly parent, I understand what you are experiencing and my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare for the seniors in your life who need help and support. Because so much of my plan for me is about the dignity that all people deserve, which is why my plan includes lowering the cost of child care, cutting taxes for small businesses and lowering health care costs. Do we have small businesses in the house? I will focus on health care because this is where I come from. I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the... Hey guys, you know what? Here's the thing. Let's talk for a moment about Gaza. We all want this war to end and get the hostages out and I will work on it full time when I am elected president as I've been. And I have yours. So there's a contrast in this election on so many issues, including our plans for America's economy. Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time. Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest corporations and this time he will pay for it. And this time his plan is a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Clothes, food, toys, cell phones. A Trump sales tax, according to the Economist, would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year. And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and he has a powerful friend in Congress, the Speaker of the House, who recently said if Trump wins, there will be, quote, no Obamacare, which would throw, understand the meaning of that, it would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance and take us back to the time which we remember when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. Thanks. because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade and they did as he intended. And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And Donald Trump's not done. Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday? That he will do what he wants, quote, and here's where I'm going to quote, whether the women like it or not. And we must vote because this is the thing. You know, there's a saying that got to listen to people when they tell you who you are or who they are. And this is not the first time he has told us who he is. He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies. This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices. He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly. But we trust women. We trust women. Which is why, yes, we will vote because we also understand if he was elected, he has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds. He will ban abortion nationwide. He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. And you don't have to take my word for it. Just Google Project 2025. Read the plans for yourself. And I think everyone here knows that we can agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. Not the government. Not the government. So, Arizona, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, I would recommend you vote yes on Proposition 139. And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right. And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. So, Arizona, I'm here to ask for your vote, which I would be so honored to have. And here is my pledge to you. As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I will tell you I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make, and I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me. And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. Because that's how a democracy works.

And you can go to iwillvote.com to get all the information you need. And to all the leaders here, please help spread the word on that. And we need you to vote Arizona because we have five days left. Five days left. In one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we have work to do. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. And we will win because we know that it's very clear to all of us here, when you know what to stand for, you know what to fight for. And we love our country. And we love our country. And we know in this election, we have an opportunity to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're exhausted with that. And we know, and we know that's who he is, but Phoenix, that is not who we are. That is not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next President of the United States. And Arizona, many of you know me. I'm not afraid of tough fights. For decades, I was a prosecutor. I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in our country. And I have won fights. I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children. And we are fighting for democracy. That's all right. That's all right. Democracy can be complicated, but we believe in democracy and the right of everyone to have their voices heard. It's all right. And I have fought for many who have harmed other human beings. I have fought against the cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings. And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as President, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. And look, we all know who Donald Trump is. This is not... Because here's the thing we all know. He is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, it will either be him or me in the Oval Office. Yes, we're going to get this done. And I thank you. I thank you. And here's the thing, because we're really clear and we can all picture it. We can picture the Oval Office, right? And if he is elected, on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. On day one, when I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. And on top of my list is bringing down Sí, se puede, si. And on top of my list, in that spirit, is bringing down your cost of living. It's an issue that we need to address and it will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. I will fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. And if you are caring for an elderly parent, look, I took care of my mother when she was sick. If you are taking care of an elderly parent, I understand what you are experiencing and my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare for the seniors in your life who need help and support. Because so much of my plan for me is about the dignity that all people deserve, which is why my plan includes lowering the cost of child care, cutting taxes for small businesses and lowering health care costs. Do we have small businesses in the house? I will focus on health care because this is where I come from. I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the, hey guys, you know what, here's the thing. Let's talk for a moment about Gaza. We all want this war to end and get the hostages out and I will work on it full time when I am elected president as I've been. And I have yours. So there is a contrast in this election on so many issues, including our plans for America's economy. Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time. Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest corporations and this time he will pay for it and this time his plan is a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Clothes, food, toys, cell phones. A Trump sales tax according to the economist would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year. And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and he has a powerful friend in Congress, the Speaker of the House, who recently said if Trump wins, there will be, quote, no Obamacare, which would throw, understand the meaning of that, it would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance and take us back to the time which we remember when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And Donald Trump's not done. Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday? That he will do what he wants, quote, and here's where I'm going to quote, whether the women like it or not. And we must vote because this is the thing. You know, there's a saying that you've got to listen to people when they tell you who they are. And this is not the first time he has told us who he is. He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies. This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices. He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly. But we trust women. We trust women. Which is why, yes, we will vote because we also understand if he was elected, he has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds. He will ban abortion nationwide. He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. And you don't have to take my word for it. Just Google Project 2025. Read the plans for yourself. And I think everyone here knows that we can agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. Not the government. Not the government. So Arizona, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, I would recommend you vote yes on Proposition 139. And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right. And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. So Arizona, I'm here to ask for your vote. Which I would be so honored to have. And here is my pledge to you. As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I will tell you I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. And I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me. And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. Because that's how a democracy works. And that's how real leaders work. And I pledge to you to always put country above party and above self and to be a President for all Americans. That is my sincere pledge to you. And so Phoenix, with five days left in this campaign, my opponent is also making his closing argument to America. And you've probably seen a bit of it. It is an argument that is full of hate and division. He insults Latinos, scapegoats, immigrants, and it's not just what he says, it's what he will do. If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies. Only on a much greater scale than last time. And it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump. We are done with that. So five days out and it all comes down to this. We are here together and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life and your busy schedules. You have taken the time to be here because I know we all love our country. We love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. You fight for it. And with that spirit and with this spirit, we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, the love that we have for our country, is to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what this is about. And I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller. And people during that time would come together from every walk of life, together from every background, every race, and come together to fight for freedom and opportunity. Growing up, when I was growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her two daughters the same chances our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love, who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith. I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out, but never stopped believing that anything in our country is possible. I have lived the promise of America. And today, I see the promise of America in everyone here, in all of you. I see the promise of America in the women who refuse to accept the future without reproductive freedom, and the men who support them, in the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future, in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States before our party. And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. Where are you? Let me see you. And I love this generation of leaders. You are rightly, I mean, you guys are rightly impatient for change. And you are determined to live free from gun violence, to tackle the climate crisis, to shake the world you inherit. And for our young leaders, here's the thing. None of this is theoretical for them. It's not political. It is your lived experience. And I see you. And I see your incredible power. And I am so proud of you. So can we hear it for the first time voters who are here? Although why aren't you guys in class? It's okay. So Arizona, we have five days to get this done. And no one can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next five days so that when we look back on these five days, we'll know we did everything we could. So let's knock on doors. Let's text and call voters. Let's reach out to family and friends and neighbors and coworkers and classmates. And as we do, here is my request. Let us please be intentional about building community. Let us be intentional about building coalitions. You know, there's been so much about these last several years that is making people feel alone, making people point their fingers at each other as though we're not all in this together. So let's approach this with the spirit that is about bringing folks back together and reminding everyone the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. So let's approach it that way. Let's approach it that way. We will be the stronger for it. And always remember, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. So Arizona, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? Proven leader, a champion for all of Arizona, and please send him to the United States Senate. So it's so good to be back in Arizona and Phoenix. Are we ready to do this? Are we ready to vote? Are we ready to win? Oh, it's good to be back and to be with so many incredible leaders. I love you back. I want to thank Governor Hobbs, Senator Kelly, Gabby Giffords, Mayors Gallego, Romero and Giles, Ambassador Jeff Flake. I am so grateful to all of you for your support. And to all the tribal leaders, the elected leaders, community leaders here today. I thank you. And let's hear it again for Los Tigres del Norte. Okay, work to do. So Arizona, tomorrow, Friday, November, by the way, Happy Halloween. So tomorrow, Friday, November 1st is the last day to vote early in person. And if you are voting by mail and still have your ballot, please take it to any drop box in your county or any voting location by 7 p.m. on Tuesday, November 5th. And you can go to iwillvote.com to get all the information you need. And to all the leaders here, please help spread the word on that. And we need you to vote Arizona because we have five days left, five days left, in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And we have work to do. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We will win. And we will win because we know that it's very clear to all of us here, when you know what to stand for, you know what to fight for. And we love our country. And we love our country. And we know in this election we have an opportunity to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're exhausted with that. And we know, and we know that's who he is, but Phoenix, that is not who we are. That is not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next President of the United States. And Arizona, many of you know me, I'm not afraid of tough fights. For decades, I was a prosecutor, I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in our country, and I have won fights. I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children. And we are fighting for democracy. And that's all right. That's all right. Democracy can be complicated, but we believe in democracy and the right of everyone to have their voices heard. It's all right. And I have fought for many who have harmed other human beings. I have fought against the cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings. And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as President, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. And look, we all know who Donald Trump is. This is not... Because here's the thing we all know. He is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, it will either be him or me in the Oval Office.

And if he is elected, on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. On day one, when I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. And on top of my list is bringing down... Si se puede, si. And on top of my list, in that spirit, is bringing down your cost of living. It's an issue that we need to address and it will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. I will enact... I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. I will fight to make sure that hardworking Americans can actually afford a place to live. And if you are caring for an elderly parent... Look, I took care of my mother when she was sick. If you are taking care of an elderly parent, I understand what you are experiencing. And my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare for the seniors in your life who need help and support. Because so much of my plan for me is about the dignity that all people deserve. Which is why my plan includes lowering the cost of child care, getting taxes for small businesses, and lowering health care costs. Do we have small businesses in the house? I will focus on health care because this is where I come from. I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the... Hey guys, you know what? Here's the thing. Let's talk for a moment about Gaza. We all want this war to end and get the hostages out. And I will work on it full time when I am elected president as I've been. And I have yours. So there's a contrast in this election on so many issues, including our plans for America's economy. Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time. Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest corporations, and this time he will pay for it. And this time his plan is a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Clothes, food, toys, cell phones.

He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. And you don't have to take my word for it. Just Google Project 2025. Read the plans for yourself. And I think everyone here knows that we can agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. Not the government. Not the government. So Arizona, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, I would recommend you vote yes on Proposition 139. And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right. And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. So Arizona, I'm here to ask for your vote, which I would be so honored to have. And here is my pledge to you. As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I will tell you I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. And I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me. And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. Because that's how a democracy works. And that's how real leaders work. And I pledge to you to always put country above party and above self and to be a president for all Americans. That is my sincere pledge to you. And so Phoenix, with five days left in this campaign, my opponent is also making his closing argument to America. And you've probably seen a bit of it. It is an argument that is full of hate and division. He insults Latinos, scapegoats, immigrants. And it's not just what he says, it's what he will do. If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies. Only on a much greater scale than last time. And it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump. We are done in the campaign. So five days out and it all comes down to this. We are here together and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life and your busy schedules. You have taken the time to be here because I know we all love our country. We love our country. We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it. You fight for it. And with that spirit and with this spirit, we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, the love that we have for our country, is to then fight for its ideals. And to fight to realize the promise of America. That's what this is about. And I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it. I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller. And people during that time would come together from every walk of life, together from every background, every race, and come together to fight for freedom and opportunity. Growing up, when I was growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her two daughters the same chances our country gave her. And I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love. Who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith. I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out, but never stopped believing that anything in our country is possible. I have lived the promise of America. And today, I see the promise of America in everyone here in all of you. I see the promise of America in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. And the men who support them. And the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future. And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. Where are you? Let me see you. And I love this generation of leaders. You are rightly, I mean, you guys are rightly impatient for change. And you are determined to live free from gun violence, to tackle the climate crisis, to shake the world you inherit. And for our young leaders, here's the thing. None of this is theoretical for them. It's not political. For you all, it is your lived experience. And I see you. And I see your incredible power. And I am so proud of you. So can we hear it for the first time voters who are here? Although why aren't you guys in class? It's okay. So Arizona, we have five days to get this done. And no one can sit on the sidelines. Let's spend the next five days so that when we look back on these five days, we'll know we did everything we could. So let's knock on doors. Let's text and call voters. Let's reach out to family and friends and neighbors and coworkers and classmates. And as we do, here's my request. Let us please be intentional about building community. Let us be intentional about building coalitions. You know, there's been so much about these last several years that is making people feel alone, making people point their fingers at each other as though we're not all in this together. So let's approach this with the spirit that is about bringing folks back together and reminding everyone the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. So let's approach it that way. Let's approach it that way. We will be the stronger for it. And always remember, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. So Arizona, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? Proven leader, a champion for all of Arizona. And please send him to the United States Senate. So it's so good to be back in Arizona and Phoenix. Are we ready to do this? Are we ready to vote? Are we ready to win? Oh, it's good to be back and to be with so many incredible leaders. I love you back. I want to thank Governor Hobbs, Senator Kelly, Gabby Giffords, Mayors Gallego, Romero and Giles, Ambassador Jeff Flake. I am so grateful to all of you for your support and to all the tribal leaders, the elected leaders, community leaders here today. I thank you. And let's hear it again for Los Tigres Del Norte. Okay, work to do. So Arizona, tomorrow, Friday, November, fr- by the way, Happy Halloween. So tomorrow, Friday, November 1st, is the last day to vote early in person. And if you are voting by mail and still have your ballot, please take it to any drop box in your county or any voting location by 7pm on Tuesday, November 5th. And you can go to Iwillvote.com to get all the information you need and to all the leaders here, please help spread the word on that. Okay, and we need you to vote Arizona because we have five days left, five days left, in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we have work to do. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win. We will win. We will win. And we will win because we know that it's very clear to all of us here, when you know what to stand for, you know what to fight for. And we love our country. And we love our country. And we know in this election, we have an opportunity to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're exhausted with that. And we know, and we know that's who he is. But Phoenix, that is not who we are. That is not who we are. And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States. And Arizona, many of you know me, I'm not afraid of tough fights. For decades, I was a prosecutor, I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in our country. And I have won fights. I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners, against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children. And we are fighting for democracy. And that's all right. That's all right. Democracy can be complicated, but we believe in democracy and the right of everyone to have their voices heard. It's all right. And I have fought for many who have harmed other human beings. I have fought against the cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs and human beings. And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way. And look, we all know who Donald Trump is. This is not, because here's the thing we all know, he is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power. And in less than 90 days, it will either be him or me in the Oval Office. Yes, we're going to get this done. And I thank you, I thank you. And here's the thing, because we're really clear and we can all picture it. We can picture the Oval Office, right? And if he is elected on day one, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. On day one, when I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. And on top of my list is bringing down Sisé Puede, Si. And on top of my list, in that spirit, is bringing down your cost of living. It's an issue that we need to address and it will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. I will fight to make sure that hard working Americans can actually afford a place to live. And if you are caring for an elderly parent, look, I took care of my mother when she was sick. If you are taking care of an elderly parent, I understand what you are experiencing and my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare for the seniors in your life who need help and support. Because so much of my plan for me is about the dignity that all people deserve, which is why my plan includes lowering the cost of child care, cutting taxes for small businesses, and lowering health care costs. Do we have small businesses in the house? I will focus on health care because this is where I come from. I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the, hey guys, you know what, here's the thing. Let's talk for a moment about Gaza. We all want this war to end and get the hostages out and I will work on it full time when I am elected president as I've been. And I have yours. So there's a contrast in this election on so many issues, including our plans for America's economy. Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time. Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest corporations and this time he will pay for it. And this time his plan is a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported. Clothes, food, toys, cell phones. A Trump sales tax according to the economist would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year. And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and he has a powerful friend in Congress, the speaker of the house, who recently said, if Trump wins, there will be, quote, no Obamacare, which would throw, understand the meaning of that, it would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance and take us back to the time which we remember when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. Well, we are not going back. We're not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And Donald Trump's not done. Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday? That he will do what he wants, quote, and here's where I'm going to quote, whether the women like it or not. And we must vote because this is the thing. You know, there's a saying that you got to listen to people when they tell you who you are or who they are. And this is not the first time he has told us who he is. He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies. This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices. He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly. But we trust women. We trust women. Which is why, yes, we will vote because we also understand if he was elected, he has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds. He will ban abortion nationwide. He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies. And you don't have to take my word for it. Just Google Project 2025. Read the plans for yourself. And I think everyone here knows that we can agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. Not the government. Not the government. So, Arizona, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, I would recommend you vote yes on Proposition 139. And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right. And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. So, Arizona, I'm here to ask for your vote, which I would be so honored to have. And here is my pledge to you. As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I will tell you I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. And I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me. And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. Because that's how a democracy works.

I see the promise of America in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom, and the men who support them, in the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future, in Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States before party. And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time. Where are you? Let me see you. And I love this generation of leaders. You are rightly, I mean, you guys are rightly impatient for change. And you are determined to live free from gun violence, to tackle the climate crisis, to shake the world you inherit.

We're exhausted with that And we know and we know that's who he is but Phoenix that is not who we are And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States And Arizona many of you know me I'm not afraid of tough fights For decades I was a prosecutor I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in our country And I have won fights. I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners Against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students against predators who abused women and children And we are fighting for democracy And that's all right, that's all right Democracy can be complicated, but we believe in democracy and the right of everyone to have their voices heard It's all right and I have fought for many who have harmed other human beings I fought against the cartels that trafficked in guns drugs and human beings And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as President there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way And look we all know who Donald Trump is this is not Because here's the thing we all know he is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better This is someone who is unstable obsessed with revenge consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power and In less than 90 days it will either be him or me in the Oval Office Yes, we're gonna get this done And I thank you I thank you and here's the thing because we're really clear and we can all picture it We can picture the Oval Office, right? And if he is elected on day one Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list on Day one when I am elected I will walk in with a to-do list And on top of my list is bringing down see say where they see And on top of my list in that spirit is Bringing down your cost of living It's an issue that we need to address and it will be my focus every single day as president I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. I will enact I Will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. I Will fight to make sure that hard-working Americans can actually afford a place to live And If you are caring for an elderly parent Look, I took care of my mother when she was sick if you are taking care of an elderly parent I understand what you are Experiencing and my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare for the seniors in your life Because so much of my plan for me is about the dignity that all people deserve Which is why my plan in Lou includes lowering the cost of child care cutting taxes for small businesses and Lowering health care costs. Do we have small businesses in the house? I will focus on health care because this is where I come from I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it On the other hand Donald Trump's answer to the hey guys, you know what? Here's the thing Let's talk for a moment about Gaza. We all want this war to end and get the hostages out And I will work on it full time when I am elected president as I've been And I have yours So There's a contrast in this election on so many issues Including our plans for America's economy Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest corporations and this time he will pay for it and This time his plan is a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported clothes food toys cell phones a Trump sales tax according to the economist would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year And on top of that Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare and he has a powerful friend in Congress the speaker of the house who recently said if Trump wins There will be quote no Obamacare Which would throw? Understand the meaning of that It would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance and take us back to the time Which we remember when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions Well, we are not going back and We are not going back because ours is a fight for the future and It is a fight for freedom like The fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body Government tell her what to do And remember how we got here Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the Intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade and they did as he intended and now in America One in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban many with no exceptions even for rape and incest which is immoral and And and and Donald Trump's not done did everyone hear what he just said yesterday That he will do What he wants quote and here's where I'm gonna quote whether the women like it or not Because this is the thing, you know There's a saying that got to listen to people and they tell you who you are who they are And this is not the first time he has told us who he is he does not believe women should have the agency and Authority to make decisions about their own bodies This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women To know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly, but we trust women Trust women which is why yes We will vote because we also understand if he was elected He has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds. He will ban abortion nationwide He will restrict access to birth control put IVF treatments at risk and force States to monitor women's pregnancies and you don't have to take my word for it. Just Google project 2025 Read the plans for yourself And I think everyone here knows that we can agree One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree The government shouldn't be telling her what to do Not the government So Arizona to protect your right to make your own health care decisions I would recommend you vote yes on proposition 139 And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right and It is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore Reproductive freedom as president of the United States. I will proudly sign it into law So Arizona I'm here to ask for your vote Which I would be so honored to have and here is my pledge to you as president I pledged to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. I Will tell you I am NOT looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to you to listen to experts to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make and I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me and Unlike Donald Trump. I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy Who he wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table Because that's how a democracy works and that's how real leaders work And I pledge to you to always put country above party and above self and to be a president for all Americans That is my sincere pledge to you and so Phoenix with five days left in this campaign my opponent is also making his closing argument to America and You've probably seen a bit of it. It is an argument that is full of hate and division He insults Latinos scapegoats immigrants, and it's not just what he says.

We're done with that. We're exhausted with that And we know and we know that's who he is but Phoenix that is not who we are And it is time for a new generation of leadership in America And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States And Arizona many of you know me I'm not afraid of tough fights For decades I was a prosecutor I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in our country And I have won fights. I won fights against the big banks that ripped off homeowners Against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students against predators who abused women and children And we are fighting for democracy And that's all right, that's all right Democracy can be complicated, but we believe in democracy and the right of everyone To have their voices heard It's all right and I have fought for many who have harmed other human beings I fought against the cartels that trafficked in guns drugs in human beings And it is my pledge to you that if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president There is nothing in the world that will stand in my way And look we all know who Donald Trump is this is not Because here's the thing we all know he is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better This is someone who is unstable obsessed with revenge Consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power And in less than 90 days it will either be him or me in the Oval Office And the Oval Office And I thank you, I thank you and here's the thing because we're really clear and we can all picture it We can picture the Oval Office right and if he is elected on day one Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list on Day one when I am elected. I will walk in with a to-do list And on top of my list is bringing down sis a puerde si And on top of my list in that spirit is Bringing down your cost of living It's an issue that we need to address and it will be my focus every single day as president I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. I will enact I Will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. I Will fight to make sure that hard-working Americans can actually afford a place to live And If you are caring for an elderly parent look I took care of my mother when she was sick if you are taking care of an Elderly parent. I Understand what you are experiencing and my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare for the seniors in your life Because so much of my plan for me is about the dignity that all people deserve Which is why my plan in lieu includes lowering the cost of child care cutting taxes for small businesses and Lowering health care costs do we have small businesses in the house? I will focus on health care because this is where I come from I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it On the other hand Donald Trump's answer to the hey guys, you know what? Here's the thing Let's talk for a moment about Gaza. We all want this war to end and get the hostages out And I will work on it full time when I am elected president as I've been And I have yours So There's a contrast in this election on so many issues Including our plans for America's economy Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest corporations and this time he will pay for it and This time his plan is a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported clothes food toys cell phones a Trump sales tax according to the economist would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year And on top of that Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare and he has a powerful friend in Congress the speaker of the house who recently said if Trump wins There will be quote no Obamacare Which would throw? Understand the meaning of that it would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance And take us back to the time which we remember when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions Well, we are not going back and we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future and It is a fight for freedom Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body And not have her government tell her what to do And remember how we got here Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade and they did as he intended and now in America one in three women Lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban many with no exceptions even for rape and incest which is immoral and And and and Donald Trump's not done did everyone hear what he just said yesterday That he will do what he wants quote and here's where I'm gonna quote whether the women like it or not And we must vote because this is the thing You know, there's a saying that got to listen to people and they tell you who you are and who they are and This is not the first time he has told us who he is He does not believe women should have the agency and Authority to make decisions about their own bodies This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the Intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interest and make decisions accordingly But we trust women Which is why yes, we will vote because we also understand if he was elected He has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds. He will ban abortion nationwide He will restrict access to birth control put IVF treatments at risk and force States to monitor women's pregnancies and you don't have to take my word for it. Just Google project 2025 Read the plans for yourself And I think everyone here knows that we can agree One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree The government shouldn't be telling her what to do So Arizona to protect your right to make your own health care decisions I would recommend you vote. Yes on proposition 139 And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right and It is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore Reproductive freedom as president of the United States. I will proudly sign it into law So Arizona I'm here to ask for your vote Which I would be so honored to have and here is my pledge to you as President I pledge to you to seek common ground and common-sense solutions to the challenges you face. I Will tell you I am NOT looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress I Pledge to you to listen to experts to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make and I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me and Unlike Donald Trump. I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy Who he wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table Because that's how a democracy works and that's how real leaders work And I pledge to you to always put country above party and above self and to be a president for all Americans That is my sincere pledge to you and So Phoenix with five days left in this campaign my opponent is also making his closing argument to America and You've probably seen a bit of it. It is an argument that is full of hate and division He insults Latinos scapegoats immigrants, and it's not just what he says. It's what he will do if Elected you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies Only on a much greater scale than last time and it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump We are done So five days out and it all comes down to this we are here Together and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life and your busy schedules You have taken the time to be here Because I know we all love our country. We love our country We love our country and when you love something you fight for it you fight for it And with that spirit and with this spirit we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism The love that we have for our country is to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America That's what this is about and I have always believed in our nation's promise Because I have lived it I grew up as a child of the civil rights movement my parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller and People during that time would come together from every walk of life together from every background every race and Come together to fight for freedom and opportunity Growing up when I was growing up I saw how hard my mother worked to give her two daughters the same chances our country gave her and I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love who instilled who instilled in me the values of community and passion and faith I've spent my life Fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out But never stopped believing that anything in our country is possible I have lived the promise of America and today I see the promise of America in everyone here in all of you I see the promise of America in the women who refuse to accept the future without reproductive freedom And the men who support them In the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future In Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States before party And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time And I love this generation of leaders you are rightly I Mean you guys are rightly impatient for change And you are determined to live free from gun violence to tackle the climate crisis And for our young leaders, here's the thing none of this is theoretical for them.

That he will do what he wants, quote, and here's where I'm going to quote Whether the women like it or not And we must vote because this is the thing You know, there's a saying that you've got to listen to people when they tell you who they are And this is not the first time he has told us who he is He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly But we trust women, we trust women Which is why, yes, we will vote because we also understand if he was elected, he has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds He will ban abortion nationwide He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies And you don't have to take my word for it, just Google Project 2025 Read the plans for yourself And I think everyone here knows that we can agree One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree The government shouldn't be telling her what to do Not the government Not the government So Arizona, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, I would recommend you vote yes on Proposition 139 And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States I will proudly sign it into law Proudly So Arizona, I'm here to ask for your vote Which I would be so honored to have And here is my pledge to you As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face I will tell you I am not looking to score political points, I am looking to make progress I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make And I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy So he wants to put them in jail, I'll give them a seat at the table Because that's how a democracy works And that's how real leaders work And I pledge to you to always put country above party and above self and to be a president for all Americans That is my sincere pledge to you And so Phoenix, with five days left in this campaign, my opponent is also making his closing argument to America And you've probably seen a bit of it, it is an argument that is full of hate and division He insults Latinos, scapegoats, immigrants, and it's not just what he says, it's what he will do If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies Only on a much greater scale than last time And it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump We are done with that So five days out and it all comes down to this We are here together and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life And your busy schedules, you have taken the time to be here Because I know we all love our country We love our country And when you love something, you fight for it You fight for it Yes And with that spirit and with this spirit, we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, the love that we have for our country Is to then fight for its ideals And to fight to realize the promise of America That's what this is about And I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller And people during that time would come together from every walk of life Together from every background, every race And come together to fight for freedom and opportunity Growing up, when I was growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked To give her two daughters the same chances our country gave her And I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love Who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out But never stopped believing that anything in our country is possible I have lived the promise of America And today I see the promise of America in everyone here in all of you I see the promise of America In the women who refuse to accept the future without reproductive freedom And the men who support them In the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future In Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before With the Constitution of the United States before party And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time Where are you? Let me see you And I love this generation of leaders You are rightly I mean you guys are rightly impatient for change And you are determined to live free from gun violence To tackle the climate crisis To shape the world you inherit And for our young leaders, here's the thing, none of this is theoretical for them It's not political For you all, it is your lived experience And I see you And I see your incredible power And I am so proud of you So can we hear it for the first time voters who are here?

And if he is elected, on day one Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list On day one, when I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list And on top of my list is bringing down Sisé Puede, Si Sisé Puede And on top of my list, in that spirit, is bringing down your cost of living It's an issue that we need to address and it will be my focus every single day as president I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries I will fight to make sure that hard working Americans can actually afford a place to live And if you are caring for an elderly parent Look, I took care of my mother when she was sick If you are taking care of an elderly parent I understand what you are experiencing and my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare For the seniors in your life who need help and support Because so much of my plan for me is about the dignity that all people deserve Which is why my plan includes lowering the cost of child care Cutting taxes for small businesses and lowering health care costs Do we have small businesses in the house? I will focus on health care because this is where I come from I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the...

And if he is elected, on day one Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list On day one, when I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list And on top of my list is bringing down Sí, se puede, sí And on top of my list, in that spirit, is bringing down your cost of living It's an issue that we need to address and it will be my focus every single day as President I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries I will fight to make sure that hard working Americans can actually afford a place to live And if you are caring for an elderly parent, look I took care of my mother when she was sick If you are taking care of an elderly parent, I understand what you are experiencing And my plan will cover the cost of care under Medicare for the seniors in your life who need help and support Because so much of my plan for me is about the dignity that all people deserve Which is why my plan includes lowering the cost of child care, cutting taxes for small businesses, and lowering health care costs Do we have small businesses in the house? I will focus on health care because this is where I come from I believe access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it On the other hand, Donald Trump's answer to the... Hey guys, you know what? Here's the thing Let's talk for a moment about Gaza We all want this war to end and get the hostages out and I will work on it full time when I am elected president as I've been And I have yours So there's a contrast in this election on so many issues, including our plans for America's economy Donald Trump's answer to the financial pressures you face is the same as the last time Another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires in the biggest corporations and this time he will pay for it And this time his plan is a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported Clothes, food, toys, cell phones A Trump sales tax according to the Economist would cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year And on top of that, Donald Trump still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act Also known as Obamacare and he has a powerful friend in Congress, the Speaker of the House Who recently said if Trump wins, there will be quote, no Obamacare Which would throw, understand the meaning of that It would throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance And take us back to the time which we remember when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions Well, we are not going back We are not going back We are not going back We are not going back And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body And not have her government tell her what to do And remember how we got here Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court With the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade And they did as he intended And now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban Many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest Which is immoral And Donald Trump is not done Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday? That he will do what he wants, quote And here is where I am going to quote Whether the women like it or not And we must vote because this is the thing You know, there is a saying that you have to listen to people when they tell you who they are And this is not the first time he has told us who he is He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what is in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly But we trust women, we trust women Which is why, yes, we will vote because we also understand if he was elected, he has been pretty clear in his behavior and his deeds He will ban abortion nationwide He will restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states to monitor women's pregnancies And you don't have to take my word for it, just Google Project 2025 Read the plans for yourself And I think everyone here knows that we can agree One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree The government shouldn't be telling her what to do Not the government So Arizona, to protect your right to make your own health care decisions, I would recommend you vote yes on Proposition 139 And make sure you vote up and down the ballot to truly protect that right And it is my pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States I will proudly sign it into law Proudly So Arizona, I'm here to ask for your vote Which I would be so honored to have And here is my pledge to you As President, I pledge to you to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face I will tell you I am not looking to score political points, I am looking to make progress I pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make And I pledge to you to listen to people who disagree with me And unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy He wants to put them in jail, I'll give them a seat at the table Because that's how a democracy works And that's how real leaders work And I pledge to you to always put country above party and above self and to be a President for all Americans That is my sincere pledge to you And so Phoenix, with five days left in this campaign, my opponent is also making his closing argument to America And you've probably seen a bit of it, it is an argument that is full of hate and division He insults Latinos, scapegoats, immigrants, and it's not just what he says, it's what he will do If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies Only on a much greater scale than last time And it is time then to turn the page on Donald Trump, we are done with that So five days out and it all comes down to this, we are here together and you all have taken time out of all the demands on your life And your busy schedules, you have taken the time to be here Because I know we all love our country, we love our country, we love our country And when you love something, you fight for it, you fight for it And with that spirit, and with this spirit, we know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, the love that we have for our country Is to then fight for its ideals and to fight to realize the promise of America That's what this is about, and I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it I grew up as a child of the Civil Rights Movement My parents would take me to marches when I was in a stroller And people during that time would come together from every walk of life, together from every background, every race And come together to fight for freedom and opportunity Growing up, when I was growing up, I saw how hard my mother worked to give her two daughters the same chances our country gave her And I was blessed to have family by blood and to have family by love Who instilled in me the values of community and compassion and faith I've spent my life fighting for people who have been hurt and counted out But never stopped believing that anything in our country is possible I have lived the promise of America And today, I see the promise of America in everyone here, in all of you I see the promise of America in the women who refuse to accept the future without reproductive freedom And the men who support them In the fathers and mothers who work hard every day for their children's future In Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States before our party And I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time Where are you? Let me see you And I love this generation of leaders You are rightly, I mean you guys are rightly impatient for change And you are determined to live free from gun violence, to tackle the climate crisis, to shake the world you inherit And for our young leaders, here's the thing, none of this is theoretical for them It's not political For you all, it is your lived experience And I see you, and I see your incredible power, and I am so proud of you So can we hear it for the first time voters who are here? Although why aren't you guys in class? It's okay So Arizona, we have five days to get this done And no one can sit on the sidelines Let's spend the next five days so that when we look back on these five days we'll know we did everything we could So let's knock on doors, let's text and call voters, let's reach out to family and friends and neighbors and coworkers and classmates And as we do, here is my request, let us please be intentional about building community Let us be intentional about building coalitions You know there's been so much about these last several years that is making people feel alone Making people point their fingers at each other as though we're not all in this together So let's approach this with the spirit that is about bringing folks back together and reminding everyone The vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us So let's approach it that way Let's approach it that way We will be the stronger for it And always remember, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power So Arizona, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? Proven leader, a champion for all of Arizona and please send him to the United States Senate So it's so good to be back in Arizona and Phoenix, are we ready to do this? Are we ready to vote?
