 Now, the most recent polling from Fox News shows an uptick for Donald Trump. The newest national poll conducted just over the last few days up till October the 14th showed him moving into a lead, although still within the margin of error. 50 to 48, the previous national Fox poll had it 50 to 48 for Kamala Harris. But it is, you guys, within that margin of error. Both candidates back onto the campaign trail yesterday. Kamala Harris going to hold a pair of events in Wisconsin, another battleground state, while former President Trump will be campaigning in Detroit trying to win the Michigan vote.
